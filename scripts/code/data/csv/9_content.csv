1,"July 	23, 1908",SPEECH AT MASS MEETING,"
       [JOHANNESBURG,  July 	23, 1908]  On 	the 23rd ultimo, all Indian business throughout the Transvaal ceased 	for the day, as a mark of respect towards the Chairman of the 	Hamidia Islamic Society, Imam Abdul Kadir Bawazeer, and the other 	Indian leaders who had been sentenced to imprisonment with hard 	labour for hawking’ without licences, as a protest against the 	Transvaal Government’s breach of faith. Indian hawkers and pedlars 	ceased their rounds, much to the discomfort of those European 	housewives who depend so entirely upon the services of these men.  A 	large and 	enthusiastic meeting 	of over 	1,500 personslibtech_1_footnoteassembled in 	the precincts 	of the 	Hamidia Mosque, 	Fordsburg, and listened 	intently to the 	addresses delivered 	by Mr. Gandhi and other speakers. A few delegates from Reef towns 	attended though none were 	  specially  invited.   	Mr.   Essop 	 Ismail  Mia  presided.	The following 	is the full text of Mr. Gandhi’s speech:  	I shall read to you telegrams that have been received  from several 	parts of South Africa in reply to the request of the British Indian 	Association and the Hamidia Islamic Society that all our brothers 	throughout South Africa should close all Indian business— stores 	as well as hawking—out of regard for the Chairman of the Hamidia 	Islamic Society, who is also the Assistant Priest of this very 	Mosque under whose shadow we are standing this afternoon. The 	response received has been most generous, and it shows how well the 	different portions of the Indian community in South Africa have been 	knit together. I think we may congratulate and thank the Government 	upon having, perhaps unconsciously, assisted us in doing this 	wonderful thing. I think that a new spirit has been infused into 	Indians throughout South Africa, and if that spirit continues, I 	think that we shall have to thank the Government for it. Last 	January, when we embarked upon the passive resistance struggle in 	earnest, the ground had been prepared for close upon 16 months, but 	it was only in the month of January last that General Smuts and his 	co-Ministers were able to test the reality of the feeling that 	underlay the whole Indian agitation against the Asiatic Act, which, 	rightly or wrongly, Indians considered constituted an attack on 	their self-respect, their honour and their religion, but perhaps the 	finishing touch was not put upon the whole thing when the prisoners 	were suddenly discharged owing to      
 the compromise. That finishing touch, in my opinion, is being placed upon the whole thing on this occasion. Evidently, General Smuts has been in-formed by some enemies from out of our own camp that the agitation last year and during the month of January was mostly manufactured and that I was principally instrumental in keeping the fire up. I think that General Smuts has now, by this time, come to understand that the agitation was not manufactured,  that  the movement was absolutely sincere and spontaneous, and, if I had any part in connection with the movement, the part that I played was that of a humble interpreter bet-ween the Government and my own countrymen. I was undoubtedly the first man to inform the community of what the Asiatic Act meant. I was the first one undoubtedly to point out that it bristled with objections, religious, and on the score of the community’s Honour, but, having done that, I claim to have done everything that it was my duty to do. It was the Indians themselves who recognized the importance of the obje-ctions that I ventured to place before them, and they decided solemnly and sincerely not to accept the Act. And here we are today in order to emphasize our objections, and we find also that one of the best men in South Africa among our own countrymen, the respected Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, has chosen to go to gaol rather than enjoy the liberty that he had received owing to his having received the volu-ntary registration certificate. He chose to suffer with his humbler coun-trymen, the hawkers, and he felt that he himself would place himself in the same category and suffer imprisonment for the sake of the honour of India, for the sake of the hawkers themselves, whom the Government wanted to have in their grip; and we have assembled this afternoon to do honour to that beloved fellow-countryman of ours, as also the others who have gone with him to share the miseries of a gaol life. It is true that the imprisonment is to last only four days—but is it only? Indians, who have not been used to a gaol life, who have never been able to accommodate themselves to the hardships of life, to them even a day’s imprisonment is a great thing, and does not sentiment count for some-thing in matters of this sort? We and the European Colonists have known all along that Indians would rather pay large sums of money in fines than go to prison. That feeling has been shared universally by the Indians in South Africa, and, yet, today we find the respected Cha-irman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, we find other prominent Ind-ians, willingly going to gaol, not because there is artificial agitation, but because they think sincerely that  India’s  honour is at stake, they feel that their self-respect is going to be lost, if they do not stand up and give a proper fight, and that fight not a fight with any weapons but the cleanest. The cleanest weapon that we have
 
2	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
 
 discovered in self- defence is the weapon of passive resistance, is the acceptance of a gaol life or whatever the Government may choose to impose upon us for a breach of its laws which we cannot, as human beings, accept. The tele-grams that the British Indian Association and the Hamidia Islamic Society have received are from Pretoria, Durban, Fortuna, Warmbaths, Volksrust, Ermelo, Potchefstroom, Zeerust, Klerksdorp, Standerton, Middelburg,  Salisbury,  Christiana, Rustenburg, Kimberley, Nylstroom, Roodepoort, Lichtenburg, Lydenburg, Vereeniging, Pietersburg, Ven-tersdorp, Heidelberg, Cape Town and Springs. I dare say there are more telegrams still lying at the office. I shall venture to read a few of these  telegrams.  The  purport of all is sympathy and support to the cause of the British Indians, and decision to close all business throug-hout these places.
 [Mr. Gandhi then read the telegrams.]
 These telegrams show that the Indians are absolutely unanimous in the Transvaal, and the incarceration of the Chairman shows also that there is absolutely no difference of opinion between Mahomedans and Hindus, that all the different races of India who are in South Africa have met in a common cause and well have they met, seeing that the difficulties that surround one portion of the community surr- ound all the other portions of that community. Gentlemen, our own position is absolutely clear. Our friends have advised us and told us that we should wait, that we should not take strong measures, and that we should not take any step that might be irrevocable. I do not quite understand the meaning of this advice. I do know this, that the ques- tion of the burning of the registration certificates should not be defi- nitely decided Until we know exactly the legislation that the Govern- ment intend to pass. That we have done. Beyond that it is impossible for the Indian community to go. The Government have put a barrier between those who have taken out voluntary registration certificates and those who are now coming into the country, and who are entitled to come in. The Government ask them to submit to the law. It is im- possible for these men to do any such thing at all, especially when their rights have been safeguarded under the compromise. What are these men to do? Are they not to trade until they have received their registration certificates? Are they to live upon the charity of their fellow-countrymen? I think that it is utterly impossible. Then these men must honestly earn their livelihood, and the only advice that it was possible for the British Indian Association to give these men was to trade in spite of the refusal to issue licences on the part of the Lic- ensing Officer.libtech_2_footnoteThe hawkers and store-keepers whose licences ended
 
 
 on the 30th day of June are also in a similar plight. They are now called upon by the Government to submit to the Asiatic Act so far as licences are concerned, before licences can be issued to them. Are they then to sit still? Are they not to trade until it pleases the Govern- ment to bring forward their legislation? It is not we who are waiting, or who can afford to wait. It is utterly impossible for us to take up any such position. We are taking no irrevocable step, but we are taking every step that we must take in self-defence. If we are to live in this country as honest citizens, if we are to earn our livelihood honestly, then it is absolutely necessary that we carry on our usual occupations, and for these occupations are required licences, and, if the Govern- ment will not issue these licences, it is necessary for us to trade without them. Some hawkers have already taken out licences. I understand that 300 have had licences issued to them without submission to the Asiatic Act. Four hundred have taken out licences by giving thumb- impressions. They did not know what they were doing. They did not know that they were submitting to the Asiatic Act by giving thumb- impressions. The balance have now come to know what the Govern- ment intend to do. Are they, again I ask, to sit still and not carry on their occupation? It is utterly impossible. It might be asked why should prominent Indians go and take up hawking and force matters. The answer is obvious and very simple—it is not possible for these men to sit still and remain in their homes, when they see poor hawkers, who perhaps do not understand the position just as well as the leaders do, suffering. I think that the leaders would have failed in their duty if they had not come forward and taken up hawking for themselves, in order that they might be able to direct their poorer countrymen, in order that they might be able to explain the real position to their poorer countrymen.
 I understand that, this afternoon, Superintendent Vernon and a detective went amongst some of the Tamil members of the Indian community. He asked these men to produce their registration certifi- cates, and I understand also that there was hard swearing indulged in by one or other of the officials. I understand that it was Superinten- dent Vernon who used an expression unbecoming for me even to repeat. I will not repeat that expression. I do say this that, if my coun- trymen have the courage of their convictions, not a single Indian will show his voluntary registration certificate. The British Indian Associa- tion has called in all these registration certificates, in order that the poorer, the humbler, members of the community might be protected, and if they have to go to gaol for non-production of registration certificates, I do hope that they will go to gaol, and thus teach a lesson in civility to the police. I shall never forget the scene that was enacted
 before the Court House when Mr. Sorabji was sentenced to be impri- soned with hard labour for one month. I cannot easily forget the hus- tling that took place, the assaults that took place in front of the Court House, under the nose of the Magistrate as it were.libtech_3_footnotelibtech_4_footnoteI cannot easily forget how the constables, without the slightest provocation, without any warning being given to the British Indians, assaulted them, how they roughly handled them, and how they roughly shoved them from the verandah of the Court House. That shows what a bitter struggle is before us. That shows also how cheaply we are held in the estimation of the police, if not in the estimation of the citizens of the Transvaal and of South Africa. It is necessary then for British Indians to show in quiet, in dignity, in perfect calmness, in a perfectly law-abiding spirit, to show that they are not here to suffer such indignities, that they are not here to have their liberties trampled underfoot, and that if all these things are done in the name of His Majesty the King-Emperor, we are here also humbly to protest, and we are here also as British citizens to suffer for it, and to show the whole world what things are possible and done even in the British Empire, even under the British flag. We have been nurtured in British traditions. We have been told that [in the British Empire] even a lamb is free. “The lamb can go with the lion,” is a literal translation of a verse I was taught when I was a youth, when I was of school-going age. That verse has not yet been effaced from my memory. I do say here such a thing is not possible, that British Indians, because they are docile, because they are humble, because they do not want to tread upon anybody else’s corns, are being spat upon, are being ill-treated, and now we have got the Asiatic Ordinance to fight, which is intended to take away the very last vestige of self-respect from us. It is because we feel these things that we have met here to honour our countrymen who have gone to gaol, that those who are here may also have that courage, may also have sufficient self-respect in them to go to gaol, to suffer the same hardships, and if you do that, as surely as I am standing here today, a day will come when we shall regain our liberty, when we shall regain the full rights attached to British citizenship, when we will be respected even in theTransvaal as men, as human beings, and will not be treated as dogs.libtech_5_footnote

          THE 	EDITOR     JOHANNESBURG,  July 	24, 1908 
 INDIAN 	OPINION SIR,  	I wish to draw public attention to the case of R. Lalloo 	v. Rex, reported in the Press.libtech_7_footnotelibtech_8_footnoteThe 	  case,  which,  fortunately,  has  been  now considered by the 	Supreme Court, shows most clearly that the Immigrants’ Restriction 	Act does not prohibit the entry of those Asiatics who can comply 	with the education test. The summons issued against Lalloo charged 	him with contravening Section 25 of the Immigrants’ Restriction 	Act, in that he, being unable to write in European characters, 	having insufficient means to support himself, and being the minor 	child of a prohibited immigrant, was himself a prohibited immigrant. 	Had he, then, been able to satisfy the education test, assuming that 	he had sufficient means to support himself, he would not have been 	prevented from entering the country. Sir William Solomon, in giving 	judgment, said:  His 	(Sergeant Mansfield’s) evidence was that the prisoner could not 	write any document in a European language, and there was no denial 	of it. Ser- geant Mansfield could only have obtained the information 	either by asking the accused to write or the accused telling him 	that he could not write, in which case, it would have been a farce 	to call upon him to write a document in Eng- lish characters.  	It will, therefore, be seen that, according to the learned Judge, 	the Immigrants’ Restriction Act does not debar Asiatics possessing 	educational qualifications from entering the country. In the light 	of this judgment, the British Indian contention is absolutely upheld 	and strengthened by the incarceration of Mr. Sorabji, who lawfully 	entered under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act, but became a 	criminal because he would not submit to the Asiatic Act.  	There is, therefore, nothing new in the claim brought forward by the 	British Indian community in insisting on the retention of the right 	of entry on the part of educated Asiatics under the Immigrants’ 	Res-     
 triction Act. It is General Smuts who demands from British Indians their consent to an abrogation of that right, which Indians are in hon- our bound to resist.

       [JOHANNESBURG,]  July 	24, 1908  [THE 	DIRECTOR 	OF PRISONS 	PRETORIA SIR,]  	Eight British Indian prisoners, who were imprisoned for haw- king 	without licences, were discharged today, and they have reported to 	my Association that, at the Johannesburg Gaol, for the morning meal, 	they were offered mealie pap, which they did not take at all, never 	having been accustomed to it. Consequently, they had to be satisfied 	with only rice at noon, and beans, if beans were available, for 	supper. These men were hard labour prisoners.  	My Association begs to draw your attention to the fact that Bri- 	tish Indians, as a body, are not used to mealie pap at all, and it 	is most difficult for them all of a sudden to take to that diet. In 	view of many more Indians suffering imprisonment in connection with 	the Asiatic struggle, I think it is but right for my Association to 	ask you  to change the diet scale for British Indians. My 	Association does not ask for any favours, but simply for a 	substitute which will be in keeping with the habits of British 	Indians. As the matter is rather urgent, my Association will be 	obliged if you will be good enough to give it immediate attention.

4,,SORABJI SHAPURJI OF ADAJAN,"
  
 Mr. Sorabji Shapurji AdaJania has been sentenced to a month’s hard labour.libtech_10_footnotelibtech_11_footnoteWe take this to be the conferment of an honour on him. A time is coming when, to ascertain the number of titles a man holds, we shall have to inquire of him how often he has been to gaol. Sorabji’s case is different from those of the others and such as brings him greater credit. Other Indians went to gaol in defence of their own rights as well as those of others. They were all, however, residents of the Transvaal. Sorabji is not domiciled in the Colony. He did not have to defend any rights of his own. Sorabji has gone to gaol exclusively for his country’s sake, and in defence of educated Indians’ [rights]. Other Indians were not awarded hard labour, but Sorabji has been. He and his family deserve to be complimented on all this. But the best compliment Indians can pay Sorabji will be to remain very firm, to achieve the objective which he has sought to serve by going to gaol, and to follow him there. That would be the right way of congratu- lating him.
 We will not commiserate with him or his family. Imprisonment is our destiny. It contains the seeds of our freedom, so that there is no call to console those who are gaoled.
 The hardships of gaol must be looked upon as comforts. Only when we are inspired with such courage and such ideals shall we be able to fulfil our tasks.
 We print a photograph of Sorabji in this issue. Everyone will admire his courage. Few indeed are the heroes who join the fray from no Other motive than the [pleasure of] battle.

5,,INDIAN TRADERS IN NATAL,"
  
 The case Mr. Haffejee of Richmond only confirms what we wrote  earlier.libtech_12_footnoteInfluenced  by  the  whites,  the   Licensing   Court   has cancelled his licences. There is only one way out for Natal Indians, or for Indians in any Colony for that matter: to resort to satyagraha. As long as that is not done, Natal Indians will not be able to rest in peace.
Most of the members who took part in a recent debate in Natal
 
 Parliament said that the Indian traders should be turned out. Mr. Wylielibtech_13_footnotealso expressed the same view. To send a petition  to  such  a Parliament will be worth while only as an act of courtesy. But the petition should be treated as the first step in satyagraha. It will be effective only if it is backed up by the power of the satyagrahic gun.

6,,LETTER TO J. J. DOKE,"
         DEAR 	MR. DOKE,        [JOHANNESBURG] 
  	The questionslibtech_14_footnoteyou 	have asked me are very pertinent and very seasonable. If only the 	public can be induced to take sufficient inte- rest in the Asiatic 	question to understand what it is that we want, half the difficulty 	will be over.  	Speaking from a British Indian standpoint, British Indians have long 	since accepted the position that Asiatic immigration should be 	severely restricted; but, if the Colonists demand that even the most 	highly educated Indians shall not enter the Colony, they require not 	only the severe restriction of immigration, but total prohibition. 	What British Indians have offered is, in effect, equivalent to total 	prohibi- tion, and yet it is not quite that. Underlying the total 	prohibition is the desire, I understand, that trade competition on 	the part of British Ind- ians should be confined only to those who 	are domiciled in the Colo- ny. If that be so, the desire is entirely 	met by confining the entry of educated Asiatics only to those 	possessing education of a very high order; in other words, in 	practice it may be limited to professional men. I need hardly point 	out that a free and healthy Asiatic commu-     
 nity in the Transvaal would be impossible without, say, a few lawyers, a few doctors, a few teachers, and, it may be, a few preachers amongst them who are their own kith and kin. These should not come to the country on sufferance, but as a matter of right. These can never enter into competition with the Europeans; but, assuming that they would be men of the right stamp, they can promote the progressive growth of the Indian community in the Transvaal, and can only be of very great assistance to it, and, indeed, to the Colonists. The only reasonable way in which this can be done is by leaving the immigration law as it is, without making the principle of the Asiatic Act applicable to such cases, for the simple reason that no identification can be necessary for men of education. To ask us to consent to an alteration of the law so as to bring about absolute exclusion of educated Indians is not only an additional objection, but, in my opinion, an insuperable one. Of course, the Parliament of the Colony can at any time bring forward prohibitory legislation independent of our consent. I should person- ally strain every nerve to oppose absolute prohibition, and should ask my countrymen to offer passive resistance to such law. Whether I would be able to carry them with me or not in such a case, it is diffi- cult for me to judge at present, and passive resistance in connection with any such legislation can only mean that Indians would far rather leave the country than live in it deprived of the natural assistance of educated men such as I have described above. Passive resistance, in my opinion, means self-imposed suffering of an acute type, intended to prove the justice of the cause, and thus to bring conviction home to the minds of the Colonists. I hope that I have made the position clear.
 I am, Yours truly,

 [July 26, 1908]libtech_19_footnote
 Our Chairman has correctly explained why we have assembled here today. We have gathered here to honour the gentlemen who have been to gaol. They are prepared to go to gaol again. All the others should show the same resolution. Once we show that courage and fill all the cells in the gaols, the Government will have to yield. Going to gaol is the key which will open the locks of our disabilities. It is necessary that every Indian should be prepared for this. But not everyone here is sufficiently resolute. Perhaps [further] sentences may be for longer terms of imprisonment. What we need is courage. All the traders in Vereeniging have started going the rounds hawking. The Government has served them with a written notice to the effect that those who hawk without licences will be arrested. Going to gaol is the only course by which we can avert the hardships that lie in store. We should therefore always keep our eyes fixed only on gaol. The Government’s offer to exempt the voluntary registrants from the law, while enforcing it against the others, is a sort of bait. The Indian community must realize that even among the Indians the Government has created two classes. This is unjust. I would advise every Indian to
 
 fight unto death if the Asiatic law is retained. Licences and registers have not yet been received in sufficiently large numbers from the people. These should be handed over. I would also advise people to refuse thumb-impressions at Volksrust. Now we shall be deemed to have truly honoured those who have been to gaol only if we ourselves—all of us—go to gaol.

9,"July 	27, 1908",LETTER TO A. CARTWRIGHT,"
        DEAR 	MR. CARTWRIGHT,      [JOHANNESBURG,]  July 	27, 1908 
  	Mr. Hosken very kindly showed me the Asiatic Voluntary Registration 	Bill that General Smuts intends to bring in. I need hardly say that 	it will never be accepted by the Indian community, if I know its 	temper well. It indirectly puts voluntary registrants in the same 	category as those who have accepted the Act. I draw your attention 	to the fact that it takes no note of pre-war refugees, whether 	holding [£]3 Dutch registration certificates or not. It rejects 	even the claims of those who hold Peace Preservation Ordinance 	permits and have thus a right to demand entry, and makes them liable 	to take out registration under the Asiatic Act. The Bill is, to my 	mind, a wanton insult to the intelligence of the Asiatics, whom it 	evidently assumes to be a lot of children who can be pleased by a 	little bit of gilding on the pill.  	I know that the Progressive Party has appointed a committee to  	consider this Bill, and then to confer with General Smuts. This 	party, therefore, evidently holds the trump cards. Will it play  	them  in  keeping with the title it has arrogated to itself, or will 	it throw British Indians overboard? Although Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, 	Mr. Chaplin, and Mr. Lindsay, as you are aware, at the meeting at 	which you were present, admitted the justice of the contention that  	those  who re-entered after the late compromise and had the right to 	do so should be treated the same as those who were in the Transvaal 	on that date, and that the rights of pre-war residents should be 	recognized. Now the Bill before me overrides all these things. It is 	a very subtle Bill, but it is also, I hope you will allow me to use 	the term, a fraudulent Bill. It will enable General, smuts to say 	that he does not take away the rights which he contendslibtech_20_footnotelibtech_21_footnoteare 	reserved by the Asiatic Act. Here lies the fraud    
 because he knows too well that Asiatics do not wish to receive any benefits under that Act.

India 	Office, Judicial and Public Records: 3722/08       [JOHANNESBURG,  July 	27, 1908]  In 	D court yesterday [July 27], Mr. P. C. Dalmahoy disposed of another 	batch of cases in which Indians were charged with hawking without 	licences. Mr. Cramer prosecuted, Mr. Gandhi appearing for the 	defence.  The 	first case to be taken was that of an Indian named Ramaswamy.  After 	formal evidence had been given for the prosecution, Mr. Gandhi 	called Mr. L. H. Jefferson, Chief Licence Inspector to the 	Johannesburg Municipality.  MR. 	GANDHI: You have 	received a list of exemptions?  [JEFFERSON:] 	Fourteen.  MR. 	GANDHI: Will you produce 	that list?  The 	Magistrate and the Public Prosecutor both interposed and objected to 	its production.  MR. 	CRAMER: 	I have no objection to Mr. Gandhi asking if the accused’s name     
 is on the list.
 MR. JEFFERSON: It is not on the list.
 MR. GANDHI: Does this mean that I cannot see the document?
 THE MAGISSTRATE (to Mr. Jefferson): Are you permitted to show the document?
 [JEFFERSON:] No, Sir.
 MR. GANDHI : But it must be a public document. Have you been prevented by the authorities?
 THE MAGISSTRATE: (interrupting) I m not going to allow it, Mr. Gandhi; that is
 final.    MR. 	GANDHI: Have you been 	prevented by the authorities?  THE MAGISSTRATE: 	Mr. Gandhi, for the last 	time, I will not allow this. Are you 
 disputing 	my authority?  MR. 	GANDHI : I am not 	disputing your authority, but my clients are poor men, and it means 	a loss of 10s to them every time Mr. Jefferson is subpoenaed.  THE MAGISSTRATE: 	I’ll note your objection.  In 	answer to the Magistrate, the witness said that he had received the 	list from the Town Clerk, who had received it from the Registrar of 	Asiatics.  Mr. 	Gandhi further asked whether the witness had been prevented by the 	authorities from giving the list.  THE WITNESS: 	I have been told not to publish the list. These are my general 	instructions.  Addressing 	the Court, 	Mr. Gandhi 	said that he 	held it 	was a 	most curious 	position that 	here they had a list 	which applied to 	the whole 	community, and which 	could not be produced. He 	thought it very remarkable that they were not allowed to see 	it. He 	had to 	subpoena Mr. 	Jefferson at 	the expense 	of his 	clients in 	every case, to 	ascertain if 	their names 	appeared on the document. He thought 	it  within 	 the jurisdiction of the Court to say whether Mr. Jefferson should produce the document.  THE MAGISSTRATE: 	(to the accused) You have had plenty of warning to get a licence, 	and you will not do it. You are fined £1 or seven days’ 	imprisonment with hard labour.  OTHER 	CASES  Another 	Indian hawker was 	then charged 	with a 	similar offence, 	and Mr. Gandhi put Mr. 	Jefferson in the box and made another unsuccessful endeavour to have 	the list put 	in. He asked that the 	Magistrate would note his 	request that the 	list should be produced.  The 	accused was fined £1 or seven days’ imprisonment with hard 	labour.  A 	third hawker was then placed in the dock, and Mr. Gandhi again 	called Mr. Jefferson.  Mr. 	Gandhi said that he did not wish to speak disrespectfully to the 	Court, but 
 it was a matter of very serious importance and expense to his clients to call Mr. Jefferson for every case.
 The Public Prosecutor suggested that the Crown might call Mr. Jefferson.
 Mr. Gandhi said that, even if Mr. Jefferson was called by the Crown, it would still be very unfair to his clients, as the names of Asiatics were very frequently mixed up. He also wished to refer to the fact that the penalty had been increased although the cases were exactly on all fours with the previous cases.
 The Magistrate imposed a fine of £1, or seven days’ imprisonment with hard labour.
 In each case the accused elected to go to prison.

12,"July 28, 1908",TRIAL OF HARILAL GANDHI AND OTHERS,"
  
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 July 28, 1908]
 Six more Indian hawkerslibtech_24_footnoteappeared in D Court before Mr. P. C. Dalmahoy yesterday [July 28], charged with hawking without licences. These included Thambi Naidoo, who went to prison in January last with Mr. Gandhi, and who was sentenced to four days’ imprisonment on Tuesday of last week for hawking without a licence, and Harilal Gandhi, eldest son of Mr. M. K. Gandhi, who was arrested some days ago at Volksrust [for failing to register] and warned to appear at Pretoria to apply for a registration certificate.libtech_25_footnoteYoung Gandhi came to Johannesburg, and immediately commenced hawking fruit, when he was arrested.
 Mr. Cramer prosecuted, Mr. Gandhi appearing for the defence. The first to be charged was an Indian named Hera Mariji.
 Formal evidence as to accused’s having been hawking within the municipality without a licence was given, and the accused, who pleaded guilty, was fined £1, with the alternative of seven days’ imprisonment with hard labour. The next to be placed in the dock were Harilal Mohandas Gandhi (son of Mr. M. K. Gandhi), Thambi Naidoo and Govindasamy Kistnasamy, who were all described as Indian hawkers. They pleaded guilty.
 A sergeant of police gave evidence that he had arrested the accused, who were hawking fruit in Bellevue East without licence.
 
 Registrar of Asiatics that his son did not intend to apply for a registration certificate at Pretoria. This letter, however, is not available.
 Mr. Gandhi said he did not propose to call witnesses, but wished to make a few remarks. He hadbeen weak enough on the previous day to protest against the increase of penaltylibtech_26_footnote, but in this instance he had a long conference with the prisoners at the gaol, and he had been requested to ask for the severest penalty. The accused had acted as they had done with deliberation. Naidoo had been in gaol last week, having been sentenced to four days’ imprisonment for hawking without a licence.
 THE MAGISTRATE: There is a previous conviction against Naidoo.
 MR. GANDHI: Two previous convictions under this Act; one for hawking without a licence.
 Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said that the two others had also asked him to ask for  a severe sentence. If a light sentence was imposed, as soon as they came out, they int- ended to repeat the action. It would be a saving of time to give them a long sentence, and it would be better for the sake of their health if they had a sustained term.
 Naidoo was fined £2, with the alternative of 14 days’ imprisonment with hard labour, and Gandhi and Kistnasamy were fined £l [each], or seven days’ imprison- ment, with hard labour.
 Two other British Indians, named Sinnappa Rangasamy Pillay and Soopa Veerasamy Naiker, were then charged.
 They pleaded guilty, and were fined £l, or seven days’ imprisonment, with hard labour.
 In each case the accused elected to go to prison.

CHI. MAGANLAL,
 I get no time these days to write to you or to anyone else. I know that you want to join the struggle. But you need not think as if you were doing nothing by remaining there. It was necessary for Harilal alone to come over. I think he did a very good thing by coming here and going to jail. Since I could not go, I could be happy only if Harilal went.libtech_28_footnoteI think it has been a very good experience for Harilal himself.
Let me know what you did to dispose of the groundnut stock.
 
 It seems everything there is in confusion. Give me some idea at your convenience. You must have seen the letter to Chhaganlal.
 I think your English is still very poor. It will improve with long practice. It is necessary to have your mistakes corrected from time to time. If you keep up a correspondence with Miss Schelsinlibtech_29_footnoteand  ask her to return your letters, duly corrected, she will be glad to do so. She does have some time to spare.

 RECEPTION FOR PRISONERS
 Imam Abdool Kadir and other satyagrahis who had been sentenced to four days’ imprisonment have now been released; some were released on Friday and the others on Saturdaylibtech_30_footnotelibtech_31_footnote. No one went to receive those released on Friday since people were under the impression that they were not being let off that day.
 When people went to receive those who were being released on Saturday, they discovered that the satyagrahis had been released at 7 o’clock though according to rules they should have been released only at nine. This was done in order to forestall their reception by a procession. But Mr. Coovadialibtech_32_footnotelibtech_33_footnote, having set out early for the gaol, met and greeted the prisoners, and escorted them back towards the gaol. Meanwhile, the other Indians arrived. Those present included Mr. Essop Mia, Moulvi Mukhtiar Saheb, and Messrs Osman Ahmed Effendi, Kallenbach, Polak and Doke. Imam Saheb and others were garlanded, and then they all proceeded to Mr. Essop Mia’s house where they were served tea and biscuits. Many complimentary speeches were made. In reply, Imam Saheb and the others said that four days’ imprisonment had meant no hardship whatsoever for them. They were ready for a second, longer term of imprisonment.
 BETTER RECEPTION ON SUNDAY
 A big mass meeting was held on Sunday in front of the Hamidia Mosque to honour the prisoners. Here they were accorded greater
 
 honours and many more speeches were made.libtech_34_footnoteA great many persons handed over their registers to the Association. All present showed themselves full of courage.
 This was followed by tea and a concert organized by some Hindus. It was attended by the prisoners and some select guests. The table was laid for nearly 50 persons. The Chairman of the Chinese [Association] was also present. Mr. Essop Mia took the chair with Imam Saheb on one side of him and Mr. Quinn on the  other. Speaking on the occasion Mr. Essop Mia said that such gatherings served to strengthen the bond between Hindus and Muslims. Among other things, fresh fruit, cakes,  mesullibtech_35_footnotejelly and roasted  pauvalibtech_36_footnotelibtech_37_footnotewere served with tea.
 MASS MEETING ON THURSDAY
 Latterly, there has been no end of mass meetings. Imam Saheb went to gaol on Wednesday and there was a mass meetinglibtech_38_footnotelibtech_39_footnoteThursday. Telegrams were sent to all the towns to request that Indian shops be closed and business stopped [as a mark of respect to the Imam Saheb]. Telegrams were received in reply from all the towns to say that shops would be closed as required.
 News was received that Mr. Khota, Mr. Gin and Mr. Aboo Mia Camroodeen of Heidelberg, Mr. Aba Varinde of Middelburg  and most of the Indian businessmen of Krugersdorp did not act upon the Association’s suggestions. On the other hand, even at Salisbury in far-away Rhodesia, shops were closed in honour of the Imam Saheb.
 All these honours were accorded not to Mr. Bawazeer as an individual but to the position that he occupies, that is, to the Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society.
 It is a great thing indeed that the Imam of a mosque should spend even an hour in gaol in defence of a [political] right. Even most of those who have submitted to the obnoxious law had closed their shops. This shows the unity in the community.
 The same day a huge mass meeting was held at which spirited speeches were made.
 POLICE TYRANNY
The police misbehaved on the day on which Mr. Sorabji was
 
 sentenced. While the matter was still being pursued, Mr. Vernon used foul language while speaking to some Tamils and frightened them out of their wits. This came in for strong criticism at the mass meeting.libtech_40_footnoteIf the Indians remain strong, it is clear that the tyranny of the police will come to an end.
 ARREST AGAIN
 On Saturday, Messrs Ramaswamy, Ali Mian, Gor Mian and Kanji Morar were arrested. They have been sentenced to seven days’ imprisonment.libtech_41_footnotelibtech_42_footnoteThe Magistrate even appeared hostile but this did not dishearten the people. On the other hand, they have only become more determined.
 WHO ARE THOSE FOURTEEN?
 In a previous caselibtech_43_footnotethe Licensing Inspector had deposed that he had been instructed not to demand thumb-impressions from 14 [specified] persons. Mr. Gandhi immediately pointed out that he did not even know of one such person. The Government, he said, ought not to be afraid of sending them to gaol. On the contrary, it ought to arrest all of them. Mr. Jefferson was summoned as a witness to ascertain who these 14 persons were. But the Magistrate, who was already prejudiced, ruled immediately that there was no need of producing the letter [containing the instructions].libtech_44_footnoteThis led to a heated exchange between the Magistrate and Mr. Gandhi. It was decided in the end to call in Mr. Jefferson as a witness in all the cases. He is asked [on each occasion] whether any of the defendants are in his list. The tempo of the campaign is thus steadily rising.
 FRESH ARRESTS
 On Monday, a large number of Indians had set out with a basket each in the hope of being arrested. Those who were not arrested were, however, disappointed, there being no one to arrest them. The Chairman of the Chinese [Association], along with a few other Chinese, had joined them in their rounds. No one arrested them.
 Mr. Thambi Naidoo, who was released only last Saturday, has been re-arrested. Since he was not arrested at one spot, he went on to another. At last, he was arrested two miles [from where he had started].
 
 The persons arrested, besides Mr. Thambi Naidoo, were Charlie Singli, Veerasamy Naidoo, Kurumuttu Pillay and Harilal Gandhi. All of them have refused to accept release on bail.
 CONDITIONS IN PRISON
 The conditions in gaol described by Imam Saheb and others deserve to be noted. Every prisoner is given a pair of sandals and woollen socks. Two woollen shirts and two of coarse cloth are also issued. At night, one is given three blankets to cover oneself with, and a hard wooden bed with hessian spread on it, so that one does not feel cold. Thrice a week, rice is served at lunch, and in the evening beans, potatoes and mealie pap. Since Indians do not like mealie pap for breakfast every day, a petitionlibtech_45_footnotelibtech_46_footnotehas been submitted to the Director of Prisons, and it is hoped that proper arrangements for food will be made in a few days. One does not get shoes and socks immediately on arrival in prison, and the prisoners had to suffer the cold for a few hours, with the result that the Imam Saheb and others felt benumbed in the feet. They were otherwise very comfortable. The rice was coo- ked by the prisoners themselves, and Mr. Naidoo attended to this. The tasks assigned to the prisoners were not excessive. The prisoner is req- uired to carry loads of gravel from one place to another. This being so,libtech_47_footnotepeople [outside] remain full of courage and are not worried by [the prospect of] imprisonment. My own view is that it will be useful to accustom oneself to mealie pap. It is not at all becoming of us to ask favours from one whom we consider an enemy. However, as long as Indians are incapable of putting up with these privations, we will continue to voice our demands [to the prison authorities on their behalf].
 SORABJI’S CONDITION
 Fellow-prisoners reported that, during the first few days, Mr. Sorabji was feeling rather depressed. After the others had joined him, however, he cheered up. He is now in high spirits. Mr. Sorabji has been assigned the task of sewing buttons on to shirts.
 The Governor and the Chief Warder of the prison are very kind to the prisoners.
 WHITES’ SYMPATHY
Mr. Littmann Brown contributed £10 to the Indian cause once
 
 before now. He has done so again. and sent a cheque for ten guineas along with a letter of sympathy wishing us success. We must be grate- ful to such whites. A letter of thanks has already been sent to him on behalf of the Association. He is a white businessman of Johannesburg. The Indian community should patronize him as much as possible.
 A sum of £25 has been received from Vereeniging,  £9.10.0 from the Khatri community here, £7.15.0 from the Indian Market and
 £5 from Roodepoort. There is need for more money, and it is hoped that every town will send its contribution to the Association.
 MEETING OF KONKANIS
 The mass meeting of last Sunday was preceded by a meeting of the Konkani community. It was attended by a large number of Konkanis. Mr. Abdool Gani was in the chair, and everyone evinced great spirit. Many Konkani gentlemen offered to go out hawking. It was also decided to collect licences [from those who were willing to surrender them] and to raise funds.
 The Kanamia community also held a meeting and displayed much enthusiasm.
 MUCH REGRETTED
 I reported earlier that Mr. Adam Moosa of Boksburg had gone to gaol.libtech_48_footnoteBut it transpired that the gentleman had paid up the   fine [instead]. He has thus descended to the same depths as (A)mangal singh,libtech_49_footnoteSuch Indians are really enemies of the community. If someone declares at the outset that he will not go to gaol, one must accept that. But it is most reprehensible not to go to gaol after having declared one’s readiness to do so.
 CASE OF RATANJI LALLOO
 Ratanji Lalloo, an Indian boy, came [to the Transvaal] with his uncle.libtech_50_footnotelibtech_51_footnoteHis father held a permit but since he had a mental breakdown, he stayed behind at Mombasa. Ratanji entered [the Colony] by him- self. He was arrested and sentenced. In appeal, the Court upheld the sentence. It was ruled that the boy could come in only with his father. There were other points [about the judgment] but these do not call for attention now. But the conclusion to be drawn from this case is that a boy cannot enter [the Colony] unless accompanied by his father.
 
 KRUGERSDORP INDIANS
 Newspapers here report that the Krugersdorp hawkers held a meeting in the Location, and passed a resolution to the effect that they would abide by whatever the Government decided. It is a matter for regret that the community has such enemies. From a letter Mr. Cursetji Desai has written to me, it appears that the number of Indians who profess this view is not very large; there are only three or four [of them]. I further hope that there are not many Indians elsewhere who show the same lack of understanding.
 WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW?
 This question is difficult to answer. Of one thing, however, we can be sure: the answer will depend on us. If we are not strong, the struggle may be a prolonged one. For the fact that it has been so long drawn out, we have ourselves to thank, for, in Johannesburg, a large number of Indians have taken out licences and the Government has already received their licence fees. The fees have not, however, been paid by about a hundred persons; the Government may well forgo the money and do nothing about these persons for six months in the hope that the Indians will have cooled off by that time. I, on the other hand, think that we shall have grown stronger. If no one is arrested for [being without] licences, there will be no cause left for anxiety. But be alone can take this view who is ever ready to resist tyranny and to defy the law.
 If the Government behaves as suggested above, it may also be under the impression that refugees will not enter at all and that Permit- holders outside [the Colony] now will submit to the obnoxious law after entering.
 KEY
 The key, therefore, lies with us. Hawkers and store-keepers should do without licences. If someone comes to inspect licences, they should refuse to Produce them. If the Government introduces a Bill of which we do not approve, we should immediately proceed to burn up the certificates and licences, and those (1) who hold the Dutch passes in their own names, or (2) who can produce strong evidence to prove that they have been residents of the Transvaal from pre-war times, [or]
 (3) who have received a good education in English should enter the Transvaal all at a time. If 50 or 100 men enter in this manner, the Government will be obliged to send them to gaol. We know, however, that it is difficult to send so many persons to gaol. We will embark on this plan only after the Government’s intentions are known for cer- tain. Meanwhile, educated Indians and others must wait patiently.
From this very instant, no Indian should give his thumb-imp-
 ression when entering the Transvaal. All Indians should bluntly refuse to give them. We should have the requisite courage; we may then take it that the law is as good as repealed.
 Among those whose names I mentioned above, Mr. Ali Mian and Mr. Kanji Morar were licence-holders, yet they refused to  produce their licences and chose to go to gaol. That is real courage.
 Tuesday [July 28, 1908]
 MORE CASES
 I have already mentioned above the names of Mr. Thambi Nai- doo and others. In addition to these, another Indian named Hera Ma- wji was also arrested. They were all tried today.libtech_52_footnoteMr. Gandhi went out of his way to demand the maximum penalty on their behalf, but the Magistrate awarded only seven days’ hard labour to each of them, ex- cept in the case of Mr. Thambi Naidoo. Mr. Naidoo was in gaol for the same offence but last week, and he was [therefore] awarded 14 days.
 THAMBI NAIDOO
 There are few Indians who can touch Mr. Thambi Naidoo for courage. He is so poor that he lives from hand to mouth. His wife is expecting a baby shortly. Disregarding all this, he has returned to gaol soon after his release. Also, his conduct in the gaol has been so good that all the [gaol] officials are pleased with him. He does not, however, flatter anyone. As Chief Picket, too, he worked with the utmost tact. I wish the Indian community would produce more heroes like him.
 ROODEPOORT
 In Roodepoort, Mr. Fakir Rupa has been arrested. The hearing of his case has been fixed for tomorrow (Wednesday). Mr. Polak will be present to see him off to gaol.
 FAKE PERMITS
 A Jew named Schmulian is being tried in Pretoria on a charge of printing counterfeit permits. His case is similar to jaymal’s.
 Here, Daya Lala is being tried.libtech_53_footnoteThe police allege that he entered with a faked register. Evidence has been led to prove that he bought it for £14. For the present, it appears that the case will be transferred to Pretoria, and from there it will be referred back to the Magistrate [at Johannesburg].
 
 Wednesday [July 29, 1908]
 The person who was arrested at Roodepoort has been sentenced to seven days’ imprisonment. He is in gaol. Mr. Polak had gone there to defend him.
 KRUGERSDORP
 An Indian is reported to have been arrested in Krugersdorp. Mr.
Polak will be present to see him off to gaol.
 DORABJI
 Mr.  Parsi  Dorabjilibtech_54_footnotelibtech_55_footnote,  who  was  on  his  way  from  Natal  [to  the Transvaal,] was asked to detrain at Volksrust for refusing to give his thumb- impression. Mr. Dorabji acted with great courage in so refusing. Local newspapers have discussed his case at length and have commented favourably. Mr. Dorabji is an old resident of the Transvaal, and enjoyed the respect even of President Kruger. All these facts have come to public notice [after the arrest]. In the end, Mr. Dorabji was allowed to proceed to the Transvaal.
 TWELVE MORE INDIANS
 Twelve more Indians have been arrested for refusing to give thumb-impressions. Most of them are poor hawkers, but it appears that they are very brave. It is reported that they will be tried. However, no news is officially available.
 WARNING
 Every Indian should remember not to give his thumb-impres- sion when entering the Transvaal from Natal. Of course, Indians will have to suffer imprisonment in consequence of such resistance, but all the same it is necessary. Only then shall we become really free.
 CARTOON IN “DAILY MAIL”
 A cartoon has appeared in Rand Daily Mail. In it is quoted a remark from General Botha’s letter to the Prime Minister of Canada: “There are two ways of governing—by consent or by force”. Gen- eral Botha implied by this remark that he himself governed  by  consent. The Daily Mail cartoonist has featured Sir George Farrar, Mr.
 
 Gandhi, and a police constable, each wondering, chin in hand, whether General Botha’s Government ruled with consent in the case of the miners, the Indians, and the police [as the case may be]. The expres- sions on all the three faces suggest that General Botha says one thing and does another, and that his Government is based exclusively on force.
 ARRESTS IN BOOYSENS
 We have just heard that in Booysens three Indians have been arrested for being without licences.

15,"July 28, 1908",TRIAL OF DAYA LALA,"
        [JOHANNESBURG, 
  Monday-Wednesday, 	July 27-29, 1908] The much discussed Act 2 of 1907 also figured in B Court yesterday, this time, however,  in 	  a  different   class  	of   criminal 	 charge,  and  one   	having   an 	  intimate connection 	with the 	offending finger-print   	clauses,   when 	  Daya  Lala,   an Indian,  appeared 	before Mr. Jordan, charged with having entered the Colony by means 	of a forged certificate of registration.  Mr. 	Schuurman prosecuted, Mr. Gandhi appearing for the accused.  Superintendent 	J. G. Vernon gave evidence that he was authorized to inspect permits 	under Act 2 of 1907. He arrested the accused outside Mr. Gandhi’s 	office on July 2. Witness asked him to produce his registration 	certificate under Act 2 of 1907 and he replied that Mr. Gandhi had 	it. Witness went into the office and saw Mr. McIntyre, an employee 	of Mr. Gandhi. He told Mr. McIntyre what the accused had said, and 	asked to see the certificate. Mr. McIntyre opened the safe, took out 	a certificate and showed it to witness. Witness refused to take it, 	and said, “Give it to the man to whom it belongs”. McIntyre 	handed the certificate to the accused, who handed it to witness. He 	then saw the document was a forgery, and arrested the accused. 	Witness took the accused in a cab to the latter’s house at 168, 	Market Street, and the house was searched, and a number of letters 	written in Hindustani were seized. While being taken to the Charge 	Office, the accused said, “I bought the paper” (referring to the 	certificate) “from Jaymal for £14. I paid £7 in Durban and £7 	after I arrived here. I gave the paper to Gandhi yesterday.” The 	accused was then charged at Marshall Square. The witness here put in 	a number of Government proclamations and notices dealing with Act 2 	of 1907. Continuing, the witness stated that he visited Mr. Gandhi’s 	office continually between June 29 and July 2, and nothing was told 	him or other members of the police of a forged certificate.  MR. 	GANDHI : You will admit 	that it is a clear forgery? 
 [VERNON:] Yes; it is a fair forgery. It would pass anyone who did not know
 Mr. Chamney’s signature. Mr. Chamney, Registrar of Asiatics, said that he did not know the accused. The signature on the registration certificate was not his, but was a forgery. There was a slight difference in the printing, in the number, and in the size of the document as compared with the registration certificates issued by the Gov- ernment. Witness received no notification from Mr. Gandhi that the accused was in possession of a forged certificate. Witness reported the existence of the forged certificate to the police. All registration certificates were signed by him only. No one in Natal had authority to issue permits.
 MR. GANDHI : Is the forged document a fair imitation of the official document? [CHAMNEY:] The document is certainly a fair imitation; my signature is not.
 Superintendent Vernon, recalled, stated that on searching the accused at the Charge Office he found a certificate of domicile under the Immigration Restriction Act No. 13  of 1903, also a number of poll-tax receipts. On the domicile certificate were two thumb-impressions, and the certificate was in the name of Daya Lala. On searching the accused’s house Police Constable Henry was present, and saw witness recover the documents.
 Mr. Schuurman asked for the purposes of the case that the finger-impressions of the accused should be taken. He would have to call expert evidence on the matter.
 Mr. Gandhi said he would raise no objection, and the case was remanded.libtech_56_footnote
 [Tuesday, July 28, 1908]
 . . . On Tuesday William James McIntyre stated [in the remanded case of Daya Lala] that he was a book-keeper in Mr. Gandhi’s employ. On the afternoon of accused’s arrest, Superintendent Vernon had called at Mr. Gandhi’s office and had asked for the accused’s registration certificate. He opened the office safe and found the certificate inside. He handed it to the accused who, he believed, handed it to Superintendent Vernon.
 Cross-examined, [he said] he was in charge of the safe. He had one key and Mr.
Polak had another. Mr. Polak was an attorney and a clerk in Mr. Gandhi’s employ.
 Mr. Gandhi was then called by the Crown to give evidence. About 5 o’clock in the afternoon of the day before the arrest, accused had come to his office and said that some men were after him on account of his permit. He (Mr. Gandhi) asked him to bring his permit and, upon inspecting it, said at once that it was a forgery. He told accused so, and accused seemed surprised. He gave the certificate to Mr. Polak to put into the safe, telling accused that he need not leave the Colony. It was then late and he was leaving the office, and going next morning to Pretoria. Upon his return he would communicate with the police authorities.
 W. F. Passmanlibtech_57_footnotestated that he was Record Clerk in the Criminal Investigation Department, and had examined finger-prints, purporting to belong to the accused,
 
 handed to him by Superintendent Vernon.
 He had compared the right thumb-print thereof with the thumb-prints on the Natal Domicile Certificate and the alleged forged certificate, and found them the same.
  H. 	Bradford stated 	that he 	was a detective probationer. 	He had taken 	accused’s finger-prints 	the previous 	morning. They were those produced. This closed 	the case 	for the prosecution. 
 Mr. Gandhi intimated that the defence would be reserved, and the case was remanded until the following morning, in order to formally read over the evidence to the accused.

 We print a photograph of Imam Saheb in a supplement to this issue. Indian traders throughout South Africa have earned credit for themselves by closing their shops in  Imam  Saheb’s  honour.libtech_59_footnotelibtech_60_footnoteThat honour was not given to Mr. Bawazeer [as a person], but to the Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, and Assistant Priest of the Hamidia Mosque. Everyone knows of the valuable work done by the Hamidia Society and Mr. Bawazeer’s role in it. He assumed the office of Chairman about the time that the satyagraha campaign started in right earnest. Those familiar with [the history of] the movement know the difficulties he has had to encounter in continuing in that office. From every point of view, therefore, Mr. Bawazeer deserved the honour accorded him. He wants to go to gaol again. We hope that his wish will be fulfilled.

 "
17,,SENTENCE ON THE GREAT TILAK,"
  
 The sentence passed on Mr. Tilak, the great patriot, is terrible.libtech_62_footnoteThe few days’ imprisonment which the Transvaal Indians suffer is as nothing compared to transportation for six years.
 The sentence is not so much surprising as terrible. At the same time it is nothing to be unhappy about.
 It is not surprising that a Government we seek to defy should inflict oppressive measures on us. Mr. Tilak is so great a man and scholar that it would be impertinent, in this country, to write of his work. He deserves to be adored for his work in the service of the motherland. His simplicity is extraordinary; but the light of his scholarship has reached even Europe.
 Yet we should not blindly follow the policies of those whom we regard as great. It would be casting a reflection on Mr. Tilak’s greatness to argue that his writings had no bitterness in them or to offer some such defence. Pungent, bitter and penetrating writing was his objective. He aimed at inciting Indians against British rule. To attempt to minimize this would be to detract from Mr. Tilak’s greatness.
 The rulers are justified, from their point of view, in taking action against such a man. We would do the same in their place. If we look at the matter thus, we realize that we need not feel  bitter  towards them.
 Mr. Tilak, however, deserves our congratulations. He has, by his suffering, attained undying fame and laid the foundations of India’s freedom.
 If the people, instead of being overawed at the sentence passed on Mr. Tilak or being intimidated by it, rejoice at it and keep up their courage, the sentence will in the sequel prove to have been a blessing. What we need to consider is whether Indians should accept the views of Mr. Tilak and his party. We submit, after great deliberation, that Mr. Tilak’s views should be rejected.
 
 India’s welfare does not consist in merely uprooting  British rule. It will be harmful, even useless, to use force or violence for uprooting that rule. Freedom gained through violence would not endure. And the sufferings to which the people of Europe submit would also become our lot then. As for the masses, they would merely pass from one form of slavery to another. No one will gain this way and almost everyone will lose—that is what the result will be.
 We believe that the easiest way to make British rule beneficent is to adopt the way of satyagraha. If British rule becomes tyrannical, it will come to an end as soon as the British Government attempts to resist satyagraha. If the same workers who went on strike in protest against the sentence on Mr. Tilak were to become satyagrahis, they would be able to get the Government to agree to any reasonable demands.
 What is our duty in this context? Though Mr. Tilak and other great Indians like him differ from us, we should continue to hold them in the highest esteem. We must emulate them in their capacity to suffer. Since they are great patriots, we must consider no honour too great for them, and act in the same spirit of patriotism. Their object is the same as ours, namely, to serve the motherland and to work for its prosperity. Compared to what they have been doing to secure that end, the course we have chosen is not in the least difficult. But we are convinced that the outcome of our exertions will be a thousand times better.

18,,TROUBLE AMONG CAPE INDIANSlibtech_63_footnote,"
  
 There are two public bodies in the Cape. They seem to be working at cross-purposes. From time to time we read reports of their disputes even in the English papers. We advise the two bodies to realize that we in this land have no time for mutual recriminations. The third party will exploit this to our disadvantage, and we shall be reduced to an abject state. The dispute between the two bodies proba- bly relates to insignificant issues. It will improve matters a great deal if all Indians aspire to be known as servants of the community rather than as leaders. A servant does not insist on privileges. He is only mindful of his own duty. Similarly, it is possible for us to remain
 
 servants of the Indian people and do our duty. A person who seeks to do his duty will have no occasion to quarrel with others. Similarly, if both the bodies in the Cape busy themselves with their duties, all their disputes will come to an end. They should both think of serving the community without expectation of reward.

19,,PARLIAMENT FOR TURKEY,"
  
 Reports have appeared in newspapers that the Young Partylibtech_64_footnotein Turkey has brought about reforms in the Government. The people are pleased, a cablegram reports, because the Sultan has adopted a consti- tution for the governance of the country, and the occasion is being celebrated everywhere. The news agency also reports that Turkey will soon have a Parliament similar to the British Parliament.
 If the report is true, it is indeed an epoch-making development. Turkey has among its common people and nobility men of such [remarkable] stature that, when she comes to have a Parliament, they can put her on par with the great European states, and indeed make her a world power. The country is so situated that it can achieve a commanding position.
 Thus, the world over, we hear the cry of swarajya. However, those who demand it hardly understand what real swarajya means. The Transvaal struggle involves Turkey’s honour as much as India’s. It is obviously the duty of Muslims to carry on that fight till the end. It is the duty of Hindus to join it, as they are brothers of the Muslims. For they are [both] sons of the same Mother India. Also, although vote- less, they have both to win swarajya in the Transvaal and they have an opportunity of doing that without much effort.

  	I have your note of the 30th ultimo. I have sent Joseph £20.libtech_65_footnoteIt is not possible for me to collect any more or to 	send more. Every penny is now wanted for the struggle. With kind 	regards all round,  Yours sincerely,   K. GANDHI   From 	a typewritten copy of the original: C.W. 4549. Courtesy: E. J. Paul       [Tuesday, 	August 4, 1908]  On 	Monday afternoon Mr. Muljibhai G. Patel, a member of the Committee 	of the British Indian Association, was arrested for being in the 	Transvaal without a registration certificate. He was admitted to £10 	bail, but he refused to be bailed out, and was detained in the cells 	overnight....  He 	was brought before Mr. H. H. Jordan in B Court on Tuesday afternoon 	charged under section 8, sub-section 3, of Act 2 of 1907. He pleaded 	guilty. Mr. Gandhi defended and Mr. Cramer prosecuted.  Superintendent 	Vernon of the Transvaal Police stated that he was an Inspector 	appointed under the Registration Act to demand from Asiatics their 	registration certificates. The accused had stated to him that he had 	no certificates, that his Association had told him not to register, 	that he had refused to register under the Act, and would continue to 	do so. He produced a Peace Preservation Ordinance permit and a 	registration certificate, taken out on Lord Milner’s advicelibtech_66_footnote.  Cross-examined 	[he said] he had received instructions on Thursday to effect this 	arrest. There were a good many like accused in the Transvaal who had 	entered and were not registered under the Act—at least 200. He 	would get instructions with regard to these directly, he hoped.  For 	the defence, the accused stated that he was a general agent, and had 	been in the Transvaal 	for about 	nine years. He took 	out his permit 	and registration 	certificate in 	1903. Last year he 	paid a 	visit to 	India and 	returned to 	the Transvaal 	on 25th 	May last. He 	had not applied 	for a 	registration certificate 	under the Registration 	Act, nor 	had he any wish so to apply. His reason was that, according to last January’s com-     
 promise, the law was to be repealed. He would take out a voluntary registration certificate, but not a compulsory one.
 Cross-examined [he said] he had learnt of the terms of the compromise through the columns of Indian Opinion. He was a member of the British Indian Association.
 Mr. Cramer put in a previous conviction against the accused for hawking without a licence. This was admitted.
 Addressing the Court, Mr. Gandhi said that he had really nothing to add, except that he was afraid that these things would continue till the struggle was over. The accused was ordered to leave the Colony within 7 days. He will refuse to obey this order.

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 August 4, 1908] In D Court, in the afternoon, before Mr. H. H. Hopkins, 12 British Indian hawkers   were   charged    with    having   traded   as    hawkers    without   licences, or,
alternatively, with not having their names painted on their trading receptacles.
 Mr. Shaw prosecuted, Mr. Gandhi appearing for the accused.
 In almost every case the accused stated that they had applied for licences, which were refused because they would not give thumb-impressions.
 In the first case Mr. Gandhi asked Mr. Barrett, the Licence Inspector, whether he had hitherto taken any notice of the fact that hawkers did not have their names on their trading receptacles.
 The witness replied that he had not. He stated that the accused told him that Mr. Gandhi had his licence.
 MR. SHAW: He did not say whether he had ‘let, hired, or lent’ his licence to Mr.
Gandhi?
 [BARRETT:] No.
 All of the accused were fined £1 [each], with the alternative of seven days’ imprisonment with hard labour, with one exception. In this case Mr. Gandhi said that there were two previous convictions.
 Mr. Shaw said that the accused was one of those sentenced last month for hawking without a licence, and was sentenced to pay a fine of £1, or four days’ imprisonment with hard labour.
 Mr. Gandhi said that the accused had been also sentenced in January last, and sentence was remitted because of the compromise.
 The accused was fined £2, with the alternative of 14 days’ imprisonment.

 NAIDOO’S SACRIFICE
 Monday [August 5, 1908]
 I am pained to have to report that Mr. Thambi Naidoo’s wife has had a miscarriage. The child was buried today. Mr. Naidoo does not know this. But the community’s obligation to him is mounting. He left his wife’s side at a difficult time and deliberately went to gaol for the sake of the community, and this is what has happened meanwhile. Mr. Naidoo is still in gaol.
 It is probable that this happened because of Mr. Naidoo’s having gone to gaol. I saw Mrs. Naidoo on the same day on which he went to gaol. She was, as described by Mr. Doke, in a pathetic state. There is hardly another woman so spirited who would face with courage a second term of imprisonment for her husband. In any case that cannot be expected of a woman in Mrs. Naidoo’s condition.
 There is no doubt that the guilt for this death must attach to the Transvaal Government. It is because of its injustices that Indians have to suffer in this fashion.
 NAIDOO’S ASSOCIATES RELEASED
 The five Indians who went to gaol along with Mr. Naidoo and whose names were reported earlier have been released. Mr. Essop Mia and several other leaders were present [at the gaol gates] to receive them. Later they were treated to tea and biscuits at Mr. Essop Mia’s. Fruiterers sent [gifts of] bananas and oranges for the occasion. Speeches were made by Mr. Essop Mia, the Moulvi Saheb, Imam Saheb and others.
 SYMPATHY FOR TILAK’S FAMILY
 It was decided at this same meeting to send Mr. Tilak’s family a telegram of sympathy.libtech_67_footnote
 RITCH’S EFFORTS
 Mr. Ritch has been working hard in England. A cablegram to the effect that he has had an interview with Lord Crewe has been received. He also states that he came away satisfied with the interview. It appears from this that interest [in the Transvaal Indian problem] has now been aroused in England.
 
 LORD SELBORNE’S SPEECH
 At his speech at Vereeniging, Lord Selborne said that no difficu-lties should be put in the way of Asiatics who were entitled to live in the Transvaal and that the Imperial Government should intervene to protect their rights. As to whether fresh immigration should be permitted or not rested entirely with the Colonial Government. It appears from this that the rights of educated persons may be difficult to safeguard. The remedy lies in their own hands. What the remedy is, we shall consider when that is the only outstanding question.
 WHEN WILL IT END?
 People go on asking when the fight will end. The Parliament here closes on the 21st. If there is no settlement before that, it may be taken that it will not come before January next. Whatever happens, it is certain that we have nothing to lose.
 SORABJI’S MESSAGE
 Mr. Sorabji is enjoying himself in gaol.libtech_68_footnoteWhatever the inconven- iences are, he puts up with them for the sake of the community. He has sent a message through the prisoners released today that he will return to gaol after release, but will not leave the Transvaal.
 Tuesday [August 4, 1908]
 MULJIBHAI GIRDHARLAL PATEL
 Mr. Patel has been seized. He was arrested yesterday for failure to take out a register under the law. Only recently Muljibhai was in gaol for four days for hawking [without a licence].libtech_69_footnoteHe will go to gaol again. Mr. Patel refused to be bailed out, so that he had to remain in the [charge] office last night. Mr. Patel was tried today and was served with a notice to leave the Colony within seven days.libtech_70_footnote
 POLAK IN VOLKSRUST
 Mr. Polak has gone to Volksrust to help Indians who might arrive there and to defend those who might be prosecuted for not giving thumb-impressions; he will stay there for some time. I hope Indians holding permits will go to Volksrust in large numbers and court imprisonment by refusing to give thumb-impressions. Mr. Polak’s address in Volksrust will be: Care of Mr. Essop Suleman, Box
 
 45. Anyone who wants to consult him should write to him in English. Mr. Polak is unlikely to stay there for more than two weeks.
 Wednesday [August 5, 1908]
 FROM INDIAN COMMITTEE AT PAARLlibtech_71_footnote
Mr. Osman and other Indians write as under:
 What is needed most now is unity, as the task you had un- dertaken earlier was accomplished through unity. In satya-graha truth alone triumphs. We see from past examples that truth has always triumphed in the end. We know for instance that truthful men like Harishchandra and Haman enjoy imm-ortal fame to this day. Can there be anyone, then, who will fail to see that the Transvaal Government has given us this opportunity to win for ourselves comparable fame and not want to join this righteous campaign on behalf of his countrymen? The chief thing neces- sary, therefore, is that we remain united. Once that is done, the Government will no longer stand in our way; rather, it will open the gates of its own accord. Our Committee therefore urges patience and firm adherence to truth in the face of suff-ering.
 These are excellent sentiments which Mr. Osman and others have expressed. Their words of courage are of course welcome. I must tell them, [however,] that it is by contributing to the funds of the Asso- ciation that they can show sincere sympathy. Money is needed for the campaign, and contributing funds is the least that outsiders can do.
 USE OF WORD “COOLIE”
 Mr. Neser, Member of the local Parliament, referred to the Indians as “coolies” in one of his speeches. Mr. Polak therefore sent him a letter of protest. Mr. Neser has said in reply that he did not mean the word “coolie” to be an insult. He used it because it was generally applied to Indians.
 WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT INDIANS?
 Mr. Alfred Barker is a white advocate here. He has written about us in a magazine called The African Monthly. He has suggested that Indians should be sent to Locations, that their trade should be  restricted to these areas, that they should not be allowed to hold land outside Locations and that they should be registered  throughout South Africa. That, according to Mr. Barker, is the only way to ensure the total eviction of the Indians from this country.
All these efforts of whites are in vain. They cannot go to this
 
 extent everywhere in South Africa. There is a lesson, however, we must learn from this, namely, that, like the whites who are tenacious in seeing through whatever they start, we should also remain unremitting in our efforts in defence of our honour and our status.
 WELL DONE STANDERTON!
 Reports have been received of the arrest of Mr. C. L. Patel, Mr. Ismail Mahomed Dindar and Mr. Ismail Bhabha in Standerton.libtech_72_footnotelibtech_73_footnoteThey were charged with trading without licences. Mr. Polak rushed over to help them. They were sentenced to a fine of £3 each, or, in default, fourteen days’ hard labour. They chose to go to gaol rather than pay the fine. Mr. Abdool Haq reported over the telephone that later ten more Indians had been arrested. These have also gone to gaol.
 Standerton has been wonderful. It is being severely tested. I had been told that Standerton, Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp were weak, and that we should leave them out of account for purposes of our campaign. Standerton has not only disproved this report but shown the highest courage. In the same way, I believe klerksdorp and Potch- efstroom will also prove their mettle when the time comes. It has been my experience in this campaign that no one should be assumed to be weak and so left out of it, neither should anyone be assumed to be strong and therefore depended upon. This undertaking of ours is so novel that no one can be sure of himself. They alone can act bravely who feel the presence of God within inspiring them to acts of courage.
 Let us all pray that everyone be given the same courage as Standerton.
 THREE RELEASED
 Mr. Govind Behchar, Mr. Lallu Ghela and Mr. Gokal Deva went to gaol last week, thereby serving both the community and themselves. They were released today. They were received by Imam  Saheb  Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, Mr. Gandhi and other gentlemen. They say that they are prepared to go to gaol again.
 WHOSE LICENCES ARE ILLEGAL?
 Some Indians here own rickshaws. There must be about 70 rick- shaws in their possession. These Indians were asked by the Munici- pality to give their thumb-impressions. A notice was served on the Municipality last Saturday to the effect that licences for [plying] vehicles could not properly be called trade licences and did not as such fall within the scope of the obnoxious law. If, therefore, the Municipality did not issue licences without demanding thumb-impres-
 
 sions, it would be required to pay damages. I heard today that the Municipality has accepted this contention and decided  to  issue licences for rickshaws, etc., without insisting upon compliance with the provisions of the obnoxious law. Those who are entitled to these licences should accept them, and contrive othermeans of going to gaol. At the moment, that can be done by hawking without licences.
 GAOL DIET
 No reply has yet been received to the Association’s letter requesting the replacement of mealie pap by some other food in the case of  Indian  prisoner.libtech_74_footnoteThis  gives  rise  to  the  suspicion  that  the Government wants to wear us down. Very likely, the Government is labouring under a mistaken notion that its refusal to order changes in the diet may deter us from going to gaol. But I am confident that Indians who are out to show their mettle will not retreat merely out of fear of [an uncongenial] diet. Hunger and thirst, cold and heat: all these must be endured. When a great war is on, one must not hope to have a bed of roses or delicious food. How can one expect a favour from an enemy? Indeed, we only stand to benefit from his harshness.
 SORABJI ADAJANIA
 A large number of persons are anxious to offer Mr. Sorabji their congratulations and therefore ask for his gaol address. The address, of course, is The Fort, Johannesburg. But neither a letter nor for that matter anything else can be sent to him [in gaol]. If there is anything people wish to be handed over to him on his release, they may forward it to Box 6522.  I would suggest that letters of congratulation be sent to his relatives. His wife’s name is Kunvarbai Sorabji. His brother’s name is Mr. Cowasji Shapurji. His sister’s name is Manekbai Shapurji. Their address is: care of Mr. Palanji Edalji Plumber, Khetwadi, 6th Lane, Bombay.
 CARTOON IN “SPORTING STAR”
 There is a weekly here named Sporting Star. It has a cartoon on the campaign. In one corner, there are the words: “Gaol in J. B. A go- od hotel and health resort”. Below are some Indians. Underneath the gaol gate is the legend: “Mr. Gandhi asked the Magistrate to award the maximum penalty to the accused in the interests of their health”.libtech_75_footnote

  	Thirteen Indian merchants were today arrested at Standerton for 	trading without licences. They were all sentenced to paying a fine 	of [£]3 or to go to gaol for fourteen days with hard labour. They 	all sele- cted to go to gaollibtech_76_footnoteThey are all  bona-fide residents of 	the Transvaal, and held, I believe, licences up to the 30th June 	last. On their applicat- ion for renewals, they were called upon to 	give thumb-impressions un- der the Asiatic Act, which they declined 	to do. Hence their trading wit- hout licences and hence also the 	prosecutions. Whatever the Progres- sive Party may wish to do, do 	you not think that, as an independent member, you should ask General 	Smuts a question in the House of Assembly?  	One thing more. As you know, the British Indian Association has 	approached the Director of Prisons for giving Indian prisoners more 	humane dietlibtech_77_footnotelibtech_78_footnote. Europeans get food suitable for them, Cape Boys get 	European food, and Natives get their own national diet. Indians, who 	are classed with Natives, are therefore entirely neglected, except 	that, for one meal, they get a small quantity of rice and fat. For 	break- fast, therefore, most Indian prisoners have to starve, as 	they cannot ac- commodate themselves to mealie pap. I am afraid that 	perhaps the Authorities out of sheer vindictiveness will not alter 	the  scale  for Indian prisoners, if only to harass them. Even so, I 	think that my cou- ntrymen will not flinch but will accept the 	additional brutality. But can you not put questions in the House and 	otherwise move actively in the matter, and bring about a reform that 	is just[?] General Smuts, when he was anxious to have everything 	from Indians at the time of the compromise, smilingly told me that 	he would listen to me  with reference to the special hardships of 	Indians in the Transvaal gaols.

I have used therein strong [expres]sions because I 	was unable to use stronger ones. I have written exactly as I feel.

N. 4855       	Some educated Indians, or those who regard themselves as educated, 	are impatient to enter the Transvaal and join Mr. Sorabji in gaol. 	This shows their patriotism. But we cannot always express our 	devotion to a cause as we want to. It will not be true devotion if 	we insist on doing so. If everyone wants to be a soldier and die on 	the battle-field, that cannot happen. For some, not being at the 	front is an important duty. That is true of educated Indians in this 	case. It is      VOL. 	9: 23 JULY, 1908 - 4 AUGUST, 1909	39 
 enough that there is at present one educated person who has been arrested under the immigration law—Mr Sorabji. Meanwhile, educated Indians in Natal and elsewhere should don the monk’s saffron robes and also dye their hearts in that hue. They must use their education in the service of the country and educate those who are entitled to enter the Transvaal in order to prepare them [to exercise their right]. Those who hold the £3 Dutch registers, those who, though without registers, had stayed long periods in the Transvaal before the war, and those Who hold permits or registers taken out after the war—these are the persons who have the right to enter. But their rights should  be  genuine. We do not want impostors. If people come in without a leg- itimate right to do so, we shall lose the battle. These Indians, especially those who belong to the last category, that is, those who hold permits or registers taken out after the war, should be encouraged to enter the Transvaal and told that, when they cross over into the Colony, they will be asked at the border to give their thumb-impressions, which they must refuse. They will then be asked to get of [the train]. They should get down, refuse to be bailed out, and remain in the police station. They should present themselves for trial. They will either be fined or imprisoned. They should not pay the fine, and cheerfully accept the imprisonment. This is what has to be explained to Indians who are entitled to enter. Indians who are ready for this should send in their names to the British Indian Association, who should be informed when any Indian with a legitimate right leaves [for the Transvaal] by train.
 Educated Indians who are patriotic should watch these trains for any Indian [immigrants] travelling by them, and properly acquaint them with the position as above. The Association should then be informed.
 Every Indian should realize that the Transvaal campaign  involves the interests of Indians all over South Africa. If they lose the battle in the Transvaal, they will suffer a severe set-back elsewhere. In no other part of the world have Indians done anything comparable to what has happened in the Transvaal so far. Even in India a similar battle has not been fought. The Transvaal campaign is a clear and pure one and furthers the interests of both the rulers and the ruled.
 That is the point of the campaign. All Indians, high or low, should understand what their freedom really consists in. Indians who feel the urge to be free and learn to have no fear of privations in gaol or of any suffering will achieve swarajya this day. They become free

 from then on. As a consequence the laws [directed against them] will be repealed, the whites will respect them more, and they will not be sent off to Locations, etc. This is a point which ought to be properly grasped and carefully borne in mind.
 Those who wish to serve India must give up all thought of serving their own interests.

27,,BRAVE INDIANS OF STANDERTONlibtech_83_footnote,"
  
 For the sake of their honour and their community and because of their pledge, 13 traders of Standerton have gone to gaol where they will serve a sentence of 14 days’ hard labour. We congratulate them on this. Standerton Indians ought to be proud of what has happened. These cases are different from the earlier ones. The sentence, too, is harsh[er]. In this second phase of our struggle, it is Standerton alone which has furnished an instance of 13 simultaneous arrests. If all Transvaal Indians show as much strength as Standerton, it will not be long before we become free. Let every Indian remember that, if the Indian community, after sending so many of its members to gaol, merely looks on helplessly or surrenders to the Government, it will only invite disgrace upon itself and be visited by the curses of those who have gone to gaol.

28,,NATAL STRUGGLElibtech_84_footnote,"
  
 The Natal Licensing Bill is fearful. It is essential for the Indian community to do something about it immediately. There is no reason to believe that the Bill will be approved by the Imperial Government. But, as the saying goes, those who are vigilant are ever happy, and we must wake up from today. The Bill may not go through this time. It is bound, however, to leave behind a trail of after effects. Mr. Taylor has said that, if the Bill is disallowed once, it should be sent back to England again, the process being repeated till the Bill is finally
 
 
 approved. There is only one course which can effectively prevent this from happening. And that is satyagraha. Everyone knows  that [Indian] licences are dwindling in number from year to year. In the circumstances, if the Indians do not bestir themselves, they will be unable to live on in peace. It will be useless merely to go on depen- ding on the Imperial Government without doing anything ourselves. The only way of petitioning the Imperial Government is through satyagraha; it can be followed up with actual petitions, etc. The time is approaching when we shall find out whether or not Indians have the requisite courage for this. We do hope that Indian businessmen will prepare themselves to manifest this bravery.

29,,LETTER TO “INDIAN OPINION”libtech_85_footnote,"
     THE 	EDITOR    
 INDIAN 	OPINION SIR,  	I have received inquiries from many quarters as to why I sent 	Harilal, my son, to gaol.libtech_86_footnoteI give some reasons below:   I 		have advised 		every Indian to take 		up hawking. 		I am 		afraid I 		cannot join 		myself since 		I am 		enrolled as 		an attorney. I 		therefore thought 		it right 		to advise 		my son 		to make 		his rounds as 		a hawker. 		I hesitate 		to ask 		others to 		do things which I 		cannot do 		myself. I 		think whatever 		my son 		does at my instance 		can be 		taken to 		have been done 		by me.  It 		will be 		a part 		of Harilal’s 		education to go to gaol 		for the sake of 		the country.  I 		have always been 		telling people that satyagraha 		is easy for 		those who 		can understand it 		well. When I 		go to defend those who 		have been 		arrested, I 		do not, 		strictly speaking, 		defend them but 		only send 		them to gaol. 		If we have 		acquired real 		courage, there should 		be no 		need for me to present 		myself in Court. 		I thought 		it only 		proper that 		I should 		make this 		experiment in 		the first instance with my 		son. Accordingly, 		no arrangements 		were made for him at 		Volksrust, and 		he was 		left to 		fall back on 		his own strength. 		Since there were others with 		him in Johannesburg, I attended the Court, but asked for the maxi-      
 mum penalty for him and for his associates. It was their misfortune that they did not get it.
  1 	have often 	advised that no 	one should 	give his thumb-impres- 	sion on 	arriving at 	Volksrust. People have 	not followed this 	advice. I 	have not 	insisted on 	the point, 	but the time 	has now come 	for me 	to insist 	on it. 	Thumb-impressions are 	now asked for 	at Volksrust 	under the 	obnoxious law, 	and they should not, 	therefore, be 	given. This 	[object] also, I 	thought, I 	could easily achieve 	through Harilal. 
 I want every Indian to do what  Harilal  has  done.  Harilal  is  only a child. He may have merely deferred to his father’s wishes in acting in this manner. It is essential that every Indian should act on his own as Harilal did [at my instance] and I wish everyone would do so. Satyagraha can be claimed to have been perfectly successful only if we do so. I repeat that
  those 	who are prepared 	for imprisonment 	should go 	to gaol 	without depending upon 	a lawyer 	or myself. 	That is 	not to 	say that 	I go 	back on 	my promise of 	defending Indian 	satyagrahis arrested in 	connection with 	the cam- 	paign against 	the law. I 	shall go 	wherever I 	find my 	pres- ence 	is needed. 	But the best way is 	to have no 	lawyer and 	go to gaol 	straight away and 	undergo whatever 	sentence is passed;  every 	Indian, whatever his 	status, must 	go to gaol 	for the sake 	of his 	country without giving 	much thought to 	what the 	others do;  no 	Indian should give 	his thumb-impression 	or finger- prints on 	entering the 	Transvaal. Not 	doing so 	will mean 	imprisonment for 	Indians. They 	must accept it 	rather than 	give thumb-impressions 	or finger-prints 	or even 	signatures as 	signifying [compliance 	with the provisions 	of] the law. 
 I remain, Satyagrahi

 [THE EDITOR
THE TRANSVAAL LEADER]
SIR,
 May I, through your columns, place before those of your readers who are interested in justice being done to all the inhabitants of the Transvaal a phase of the Asiatic question?libtech_88_footnote
 I read in your impression of today’s date a brief report of the two cases of Indians who were alleged to have been connected with forged certificates. One of the men secured his  discharge by becoming King’s evidence. The man against whom he became King’s evidence has also been discharged. The public know how far one party, according to his own confession, was involved in the forgery traffic. The evidence against the other was undoubtedly, according to the newspaper reports, too weak to sustain a conviction. Thus those who are connected with the forgery are largely free. The Asiatic Law Amendment Act does not, and did not, touch them. They were not charged under it either, and I frankly admit that no Asiatic Act could deal with such cases. Wherever there is restriction on personal liberty, there will be found people ready enough to resort to a variety of practices to shirk such restriction. It is worthy of note that Indians were not the only parties connected with the traffic. Europeans are
 
 asserts that Asiatics sent to gaol under the present Tom-fool administration of the Asiatic Act are being half-starved, owing to their not being given the kind of food they are accustomed to, and to their inability to consume that which is supplied to them. These men are political prisoners; it is unjust if they are put to hard labour or made to wear prison clothing; it is infamously unjust if they are treated dietetically as Mr. Gandhi says they are. We thought that countries professing themselves civilized had abolished torture. We seem to be an exception. Surely the medical authorities of the prisons are recommending the prisoners food which they can take? Are the medical officials’ instructions obeyed, as it is the duty of everybody connected with the Prisons Department, from the Colonial Secretary downwards, to obey them? Are the medical officers’ views being set aside? It is not as if there were any cooking difficulties. There is no food more easily prepared than rice.
 If Mr. Gandhi’s accusation be well founded, we are acting in a way which would disgrace a Turkish province, let alone one of the British Imperial States.”
 also alleged to have been engaged in it.
 Now, let your readers turn to the other side of the picture. Indians who have entered the Colony openly, who have proved their pre-war residence, who have always conformed to its laws, and who have recently, by universal acknowledgement, helped the Government completely to identify such persons, are being harassed on all sides, and subjected, to use Lord Milner’s historic  expression,  to “pinpricks”. Inoffensive Indians—in many instances Indians belon- ging to the highest strata of the Indian community—are being impris- oned, not because they have committed any heinous offence, but because their conscience does not approve of what they consider to be irritating and insulting legislation. Standerton is at present practically denuded of its chief Indian store-keepers, who are now serving a term of 14 days’ imprisonment, with hard labour.
 As if this were not in itself sufficient harassment, no relief has yet been granted regarding the food of these Indian prisoners. European prisoners get that food  to which they are generally accustomed; Cape Boys receive European food; Natives get a diet to which they are accustomed; Indian prisoners get practically Native diet, and, therefore, are half-starved. They get mealie pap for breakfast every day and mealie pap for supper three times per week. Mealie pap, I know, to those who are accustomed to it, or who can by a long course of training habituate themselves to it, is good. Unfortunately, my countrymen do not take mealie pap. The result is that in the Transvaal gaols they have to suffer partial starvation. The authorities have been approached for relief,libtech_89_footnotebut up to the time of writing there has been no response. My countrymen draw the conclusion, probably unjustifiably, that relief has been withheld in order to exasperate the Indians into submission. If so, let the authorities take care that they do not exasperate them into bitterest opposition to the Government and their measures.
 Asiatics, having fulfilled their part of the contract, are now endeavouring to keep General Smuts to his part of  that  contract, which, according to The Transvaal Leader, he publicly declared to be as follows: “He had told them (the Asiatics) that the law would not be repealed so long as there was an Asiatic in the country who had not registered”;libtech_90_footnotelibtech_91_footnoteand,  again,  “Until  every  Indian  in   the   country   had registered the law would not be repealed”. It is admitted that all
 
 Asiatics who had the opportunity of making application for voluntary registration have done so. Asiatics now ask, “Why, then, has the Act not yet been repealed, and why was the offer to repeal the Act made under impossible conditions?”

31,"August 	10, 1908",TRIAL OF HARILAL GANDHI-IIlibtech_92_footnote,"
         [JOHANNESBURG,  August 	10, 1908]  An 	unusually large crowd of 	Indians assembled in 	B Court yesterday 	afternoon [August 	10] to hear 	the case 	of Harilal 	Mohandas Gandhi, a son of 	Mr. M. K. Gandhi, aged 	20, and described as 	a student, 	who was brought 	before Mr. H. 	H. Jordan on 	a charge 	of contravening 	the Asiatic 	Amendment Act by 	failing to 	be in possession of 	 a registration certificate.  The 	accused pleaded guilty, 	and was defended 	by his 	father. Mr. 	A. Cramer 	prosecuted. 	Superintendent Vernon, of 	B Division, 	gave evidence of arrest, 	and further 	stated that he called 	upon the accused 	to produce 	his certificate 	of registration, 	who, however, failed to do so, saying that he did not possess one.  Mr. 	Gandhi, on 	behalf of 	the accused, said that 	the latter 	had no desire 	to leave 	the Colony, 	but nevertheless 	he was 	desirous that the 	Court should make an 	order for 	the accused to 	leave the Colony 	within 24 hours. 	He made 	the request because two 	other Indians whose time 	under the Act would expire on Wednesday would be ready to go 	to gaol. He 	(Mr. Gandhi) 	hoped His Worship 	would adopt this course, 	as the 	accused’s affairs were 	in his hands.  Mr. 	Jordan ordered the accused to leave the Colony within seven days.

32,"August 	10, 1908",SPEECH AT MASS MEETING,"
           [JOHANNESBURG, 
  August 	10, 1908]  Immediately 	after the case in which Harilal Gandhi was charged with being in the 	Colony without a registration certificate yesterday [August 10, 	1908,] a mass meeting of Indians was held in an open space near the 	Court buildings. Mr. M. K. Gandhi addressed the meeting in English, 	and said that he had just received a telegram    
 from Vereeniging to the effect that several Indian store-keepers who were arrested for hawking or trading without licences had been given by the Magistrate no option of imprisonment, but had been fined £2. 7s. 6d each, and had to pay the fines within 24 hours, or elect to have their goods sold by the Court. This introduced a new phase into the struggle, but he had no doubt that British Indians would not be baffled by this. He did not know whether the Magistrate had received instructions from the Law Department to put into force the provisions of the law for certain exceptional cases, or whether the Magistrate had done this on his own initiative, but it showed to them that they were going to receive no quarter from General Smuts, nor did it behove them   to ask for quarter. They were carrying on a fight in order that General Smuts might be compelled to carry out his promise to repeal the Act— a promise which was published in an account of a meeting held at Richmond, when he said that when all had registered he would repeal the Act.libtech_93_footnotelibtech_94_footnoteThere was one incident in connection with the matter which he (Mr. Gandhi) wished to recall. When he was lying in Mr. Doke’s house, the Registrar of Asiatics came to him and said that it appeared that the Chinese and some Indians would not come forward, as they were suspicious of the intentions of the Government, and wanted something in black and white to confirm the promises made. A notice was drafted there and then, which was to be published in all the Indian languages and in the Chinese language, stating that, if the Asiatic communities carried out their compact, the Act would be repealed during the next session.
 “FORTUNATELY”
 Unfortunately—no, he would say fortunately, because they were now in a position to know with whom they were dealing—fortunately, the next day Mr. Chamney brought the news that all the Asiatics were coming in, and that the Chinese had withdrawn their objections, and asked whether he (Mr. Gandhi) thought it necessary that the notice should be published. They had then no reason to doubt the honesty of Mr. Smuts or Mr. Chamney, and he replied that there was no reason for the publication of the notice. He would only say that when Mr. Smuts made the statement at Richmond he must have had in his thoughts some such difficulty cropping up with the Asiatics as that which Mr. Chamney spoke to him of, and it was for this reason that he made the declaration. Today they found that General Smuts had offered to repeal the Act on certain conditions, which could not be accepted—conditions which were not imposed on them when they agreed to take out voluntary registration certificates.libtech_95_footnote
 PURE ADMINISTRATION AND THE EMPIRE’S PEACE
 The Asiatics were helping the Government against themselves, and helping Mr. Smuts to keep to his word, and maintaining the purity of administration within the colony and peace within the Empire. If they found that the statesmen who were
 
 controlling the Government in South Africa had no notion of ordinary honesty and that, when it suited them, they withdrew from their promises, and tried to break these promises, the British Indians should compel them to keep their promises, and by so doing they would be rendering a signal service not only to the Colony but to the Empire. It did not therefore baffle them when they stood face to face with suffering imprisonment, with being half-starved, and going barefooted in the prisons, and it did not baffle them when they stood face to face with having their goods confiscated. He could only characterize this as organized robbery—legalized robbery. They were now brought under a section of a law which was only designed for exceptional purposes.
 DECLINE TO PAY
 He hoped that his countrymen had sufficient self-sacrifice to decline to pay their fines, and have their goods sold under their noses. He had no doubt that the Colonists themselves, when they saw that the British Indians would suffer this, they would ask General Smuts to stay his hand and keep his promises, and to repeal the Act  on the conditions he had agreed upon. They had to suffer in order that they might give complete identification to the compact made by General Smuts with them. The Chairman of the British Indian Association had his nose broken because he stood up for the Government in keeping his compact with them,libtech_96_footnoteand the reward of the Government for this was a broken promise—a breach of faith. He had no hesitation in repeating anywhere that this was the solemn promise made by General Smuts. They found that not only was the Act not repealed, but all kinds of vexatious regulations were being passed through Parliament affecting those who came from British India.
 PARTNERS IN SOUTH AFRICA
 He said that this country was as much the British Indian’s as the white man’s. They were partners and the white men were predominant partners, but they were only partners. The Indians only wanted justice and fair play, and if they could not get that they should show that they were prepared to suffer. His opinion was that no man who called himself a subject of King Edward should allow his rights to be taken away from him, but should suffer if necessary in order to prevent this. In this country, because they had committed the crime of having a coloured skin, they were as nothing, their feelings should be set aside, their sentiments disregarded, and their consciences set at naught. Let them show that they had sufficient of the spirit of self-sacrifice to suffer the confiscation of their property in order to compel the Government to keep its part  of a compact which the Asiatics had honourably fulfilled. Mr. Naidoo had only come out of gaol that day. He (Mr. Gandhi) had declared before that Mr. Smuts was respon- sible for the death of the Chinaman who had committed suicide.libtech_97_footnoteMr. Smuts was responsible for this, and he was now responsible for the murder of young Mr. Naidoo.
 
 Mrs. Naidoo was in pain when Mr. Naidoo went to gaol, and Mrs. Naidoo had given birth to a still-born child. Who was responsible for this if not Mr. Smuts? He (Mr. Gandhi) was certain that all these pains would have to be accounted for, if not now, then hereafter. Mr. Smuts was a Christian, and believed, as they all believed, in a hereafter, and he would have to answer for these things just as they would have to answer for their actions.
 Mr. Gandhi concluded with a further appeal to British Indians to suffer  whatever might be necessary for what they considered was right and just, and then proceeded to speak in Gujarati.libtech_98_footnote

33,"August 	11, 1908",TRIAL OF THREE HAWKERS,"
           [JOHANNESBURG, 
  August 	11, 1908]  . 	. . Three Indian hawkers were charged before Mr. H. H. Hopkins in D 	Court yesterday morning [August 11] with trading as hawkers without 	licences, or, alternatively, with failing to produce their licences 	when called upon. Mr. Shaw prosecuted, Mr. Gandhi appearing for the 	defence.  While 	giving evidence in one case, Mr. French, Municipal Licence 	Inspector, said that one of the accused had told him that his 	licence was in the possession of Mr. Gandhi. Witness went to Mr. 	Gandhi’s office, and was there told that they did not have the 	licence.  Mr. 	Gandhi went into the witness-box, and said that with reference to 	what the accused was alleged to have said, witness held several 	licences, probably two or three hundred, which had been deposited 	with him, and also held probably a thousand registration 	certificates, which had also been deposited with him by British 	Indians, who had made up their minds not to make use of these 	certificates or licences. He had not searched his records to see 	whether he had this particular licence or not, as the Inspector had 	not asked him to do so.  Two 	of the accused said that they had not taken out licences, as they 	were required to give their thumb-impressions before licences were 	issued.  Replying 	to the Magistrate, Mr. Shaw said that the extreme penalty for the 	offence was a fine of £20, or three months’ imprisonment.  All 	of the accused were found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of £1, 	or go to prison for 	seven days with hard labour.  They 	all elected to go to gaol. . . .

34,"August 11, 1908",TRIAL OF QAZI HASSAN AND OTHERS,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 August 11, 1908] Before Mr. Cross in C Court in the afternoon, five other British Indians were charged with hawking without licences, or,  alternatively, with failing to  produce
their licences when called upon, and also with not having their names printed on their
trading receptacles.
 Mr. Gandhi appeared for the accused.
 Qazi Hassan, the first to be charged, pleaded not guilty, and said that he had shown his certificate to the Inspector.
 Mr. French, a Municipal Licence Inspector, gave evidence as to having seen the accused exposing goods for sale. When called upon to produce his licence, he did not do so. Later on, at the Charge Office, he produced his licence.
 Mr. Gandhi said that he now understood why the accused had pleaded not guilty. He had a licence, but in common with the others had declined to produce it when the Inspector spoke to him.
 THE MAGISTRATE: I am satisfied that he has produced his licence.
 The Magistrate found the accused not guilty on the first two counts, but guilty of not having his name painted on his basket. He was cautioned and discharged.
 Ahmed Essop was then charged, and pleaded guilty to failing to produce his licence when called upon.
 Mr. Gandhi remarked that it was evident the accused’s licence was in good
 hands.   THE 	MAGISTRATE: Are those 	your hands, Mr. Gandhi?  MR. 	GANDHI: I am afraid so, 	Sir.  The 	accused was fined £l or seven days’ imprisonment with hard 	labour.  A 	hawker named Packiry was then charged, and was also fined £l or 	seven days’ 
 imprisonment 	with hard labour.  The 	last to be charged were Ebrahim Maravin and Ismail Ahmed.  Mr. 	Barrett, Municipal 	Licence Inspector, 	in giving 	evidence, said 	that he wished 	to mention 	that Mr. Gandhi 	had some 	two or three 	hundred licences belonging 	to hawkers.  MR. 	GANDHI: I gave that in 	evidence this morning.libtech_99_footnote  The 	witness said that when hawkers were called upon to produce their 	licences, they said that they were in the possession of Mr. Gandhi.    
 THE MAGISTRATE: If they hand their licences over to Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Gandhi can hardly be blamed for that.
 Mr. Gandhi said that the hawkers had surrendered these licences because they thought they had no right to make use of licences which others could not get. They were in possession of licences when the Government issued secret instructions in regard to issuing licences, and as the other Indians could not obtain licences, these men who had them had handed them over to the British Indian Association.
 The accused were fined £1, with the alternative of seven days’ imprisonment with hard labour.
 They elected to go to gaol.

 In B Court yesterday [August 12] before Mr. H.H. Jordan, an Indian named Mulji Girdharlal Patel was charged with having failed to leave the Colony after having been ordered to do so by the Court. The accused was charged at the Court about   a week ago for failing to produce a registration certificate, and was ordered to leave the Colony within seven day.libtech_100_footnote
 Mr. Cramer prosecuted, and Mr. Gandhi appeared for the accused, who pleaded
guilty.
 Superintendent Vernon gave evidence that he arrested the accused at 6-10
 yesterday morning on a charge of having failed to leave the Colony, or register, when ordered to do so.
 In reply to Mr. Gandhi, the witness said that the accused had no authority to remain in the Colony.
MR. GANDHI: You say he has no authority to reside in the country.
Is that so?
 [VERNON:] Yes.
 [GANDHIJI:] Does he not hold a permit under the Peace Preser- vation Ordinance?
 Yes.
 Does not that permit entitle the holder to enter and reside in the country?
 Yes; but the Peace Preservation Ordinance is now repealed.
 Do you suggest that the repeal of the Peace Preservation Ordinance cancels permits issued under it?
 
 Yes.
 Do you then hold that all permits issued under the Peace Preservation Ordinance have become invalid? Yes.
 MR. GANDHI: I am afraid that the Court will not hold with your contention.
 The accused was sentenced to one month’s imprisonment with hard labour.
 The accused has been resident in the Transvaal for nearly 10 years, and is an educated man, possessing considerable influence, particularly with one section, a division of the Bombay Hindus. He possesses a Peace Preservation Ordinance certifi- cate issued under the agreement made with Lord Milner.libtech_101_footnote

 NAIDOO RELEASED
 Mr. Thambi Naidoo was released at nine this morning. He was received [at the gaol gate] by Mr. Essop Mia, Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Kunkey, Mr. Gandhi and some Chinese. Mr. Naidoo’s health has suffered somewhat. His courage, however, has doubled. He says he will court a fourth term of imprisonment.
 He had to see Mrs. Naidoo without delay. He and the Indians who had gone to receive him then proceeded to his house. Mr. Essop Mia and others made short speeches and the meeting came to an end after Mr. Naidoo had replied.
 Mrs. Naidoo is progressing. Earlier, she had been down with fever for two days. A social gathering of Tamils is due to take place this evening in Mr. Naidoo’s honour. There is also a move to fete him in public on behalf of all the [Indian] communities.
 HARILAL GANDHI’S CASE
 They swooped down on Harilal Gandhi today. He was arrested on the charge of being in the Transvaal without a register. The case was heard at 2 o’clock.libtech_102_footnoteMr. Gandhi asked for twenty-four hours’ notice since he [Harilal] had no preparations to make and had made up his mind to go to gaol. But the Magistrate gave him seven days’ notice. I hope that after seven days we shall find him engaged in hard
 
 physical labour in gaol. Gaol life is good education for anyone who accepts it in full knowledge of what it means. It is an important part of children’s training that they should be taught to bear hardships from their earliest years.
 Mr. George Godfrey, who has only recently started practice, has announced that he will not charge any fees for appearing in any case which serves the community as a whole. This offer deserves commendation and Mr. Godfrey must be given credit for putting his education to the best use.
 HOSKEN BRINGS BAD NEWS
 Mr. Hosken has brought the news that the Progressive Party will oppose the repeal of the [Asiatic] Act. [However,] no one is now likely to be alarmed by it. In January, that party was opposed [to us]libtech_103_footnotelibtech_104_footnote: so were the others, yet we fought and won. It would not be surprising if this were to happen again. Our opponents will be confounded by the real strength of Indians, when they behold it. Like the owl which, dazzled by the sunlight, retreats into the obscurity of the shade, the treachery in General Smuts and the opposition of the  Progressive Party will flinch before the light of Indian truth. However, what is essential is that the truth of the Indians must shine forth.
 STENT’S SPEECH
 In the course of a speech in Pretoria, Mr. Stent, a Progressive and editor of Pretoria News, said:
 General Smuts has lowered the prestige of the Colony by his handling of the Asiatic question. He introduced the unjust Asiatic law. Whatever attitude the Colonists may take up, they cannot but admit that the Government has made a mess of the whole matter. On the one hand, it incited the whites against Indians. On the other, General Smuts entered into negotiations with the Indians for a compromise. On the one hand, he held out threats against Indians. On the other, he surrendered on the Asiatics’ own terms.
 Mr. Smuts has started another controversy with Mr. Gan- dhi. I am certain he will be beaten again. The Asiatics will not always remain passive resisters. They will go further and insist actively upon equal rights; and you will have to give them equal
 
 rights not because you believe they are justly  entitled  but because you are too weak to refuse them.
 This speech of Mr. Stent deserves attention. He understands that Mr. Smuts has played foul, that he is in the wrong and that Indians are in the right. Falsehood is always weaker than truth. If the Indian community would only fulfil the one Condition of remaining truthful, it is bound to win.
 Tuesday [August 11, 1908]
 NAIDOO HONOURED
 The Tamils held a meeting at 6 p.m. yesterday in Market Street in honour of Mr. Thambi Naidoo. Messrs Essop Mia, Imam Abdool Kadir, Coovadia and others were present. A number of speeches praising Mr. Naidoo’s courage were made, and he was garlanded and cheered. The meeting went on up to 8 o’clock.
 HAWKERS ARRESTED
 The following Indians have been arrested for trading without licences: Mr. Ahmed Essop, Mr. Valli Hoosenlibtech_105_footnotelibtech_106_footnote, Mr. Kara Odhav, Mr. Ebrahim Maravia, Mr. Ismail Ahmed, Mr. Jivan Bhikha, and Mr. Suleman Moosa. Among these, Mr. Valli Hoosen held a licence but refused to produce it. It was stated in the course of the evidence that he was later found to be in possession of a licence; he was then released. All the others were sentenced to a fine of £1, or, in default, seven days’ imprisonment. They have chosen to undergo imprison- ment rather than pay the fine. In this case, there was some difficulty in obtaining the sentence of imprisonment, for, in view of the bail money [that had been paid], it was feared that only a fine might be imposed as at Vereeniging. But before this could happen, Mr. Gandhi had withdrawn the bail on behalf of those accused in whose cases there was reason to fear some such development.
 WARNING
 One must heed this warning and not pay bail money. If it is at all necessary to offer bail-money, it must be done by other persons. The police cannot demand [payment of] bail-money. Even those who have money in their pockets must courageously refuse to offer bail.
 PATEL AND NAIDOO
 Mr. Patel and Mr. P. K. Naidoo, who had received seven days’ notice [to leave the Colony], may be arrested any day.libtech_107_footnote
 
 SORABJI
 Mr. Sorabji will be released on Wednesday next, the 18th. I hope that there will be hundreds of Indians to greet and welcome him. There is a move to accord fitting honours to Mr. Sorabji.
 Wednesday [August 12, 1908]
 MULJIBHAI PATEL
 Mr. Patel was arrested today at 6 a.m. The case came up at ten o’clock.libtech_108_footnotelibtech_109_footnoteMr. Gandhi attended. Mr. Patel offered no evidence. There was a mild exchange between Mr. Vernon [and Mr. Gandhi] in the course of [the former’s] cross-examination. Mr. Patel was sentenced to a month’s hard labour. He is full of courage, and was quite  cheerful. As more and more of these men go to  gaol,  the  community’s responsibility increases correspondingly. Having thus sent them off to gaol, the community ought not to yield.
 TWO HAWKERS
 Mr. Odhav Bhikha and Mr. M. Sivalingam Pillay were tried for trading without [a] hawking [licence]. Each was sentenced to a fine of
£1 or [in default] seven days’ imprisonment. Both these brave men chose to go to gaol rather than pay the fine.
 IN GERMISTON
 An Indian named Nana was to be tried. He did not attend [the Court at the appointed time], and so his bail was  estreated.  Mr. Godfrey was to go to defend him. Such men do a great deal of harm to the community.
 IN KLERKSDORP
 There was a similar case against an Indian named Abdool Ahmed. He courageously defended himself and stated in evidence that he would not give a thumb-impression under any circumstances. He was sentenced to four days’ imprisonment or a fine of £1. To be sure, the gentleman went to gaol, but the next day he paid the fine! This incident was reported in the newspapers here, but for which we could not even have known about it.
 HOW TO PUT UP A FIGHT
 Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, Mr. Fancy, Mr. Ibrahim Coovadia, Mr. Omarji Sale, Mr. Dildar Khan, Mr. Ahmed Moosaji and
 
 Mr. Mohanlal Goshalia—all these Indians left for Charlestown today. They will return and refuse to give their finger-prints [at the border while re-entering]. They will also refuse to produce their registers and thus go to gaol.

37,"August 	12, 1908",LETTER TO “THE STAR”libtech_110_footnote,"
         [THE EDITOR THE STAR] SIR,           [JOHANNESBURG,  August 	12, 1908] 
  	You will, I hope, allow me to correct you with regard to the 	question of educated Indians, touched upon in your leader of 	yesterday on the Asiatic struggle.libtech_111_footnotelibtech_112_footnoteBritish 	Indians do not ask for the opening of the door to educated Indians. 	They ask that the door should be left open as it is at present under 	 the  Immigrants’ Restriction Act. You assume that a demand is 	being made  for admitting English-speaking lads. The truth is that 	Indians have declared that they would be satisfied with an education 	test, no matter how severe, so long as the door is kept open (not 	now to be opened) for those possessing the highest educational 	attainments.  	You say that General Smuts will be justified in withdrawing from any 	promise he may have made, in view of the above alleged fresh demand. 	From the facts stated by me, you can verify for yourself that      accuses 	the Colonial 	Secretary of a 	flagrant breach of 	promise in 	that he 	declines to 	repeal the 	Asiatic Act, while on 	the other 	hand Mr. Smuts 	insists that the Asiatic 	leader now demands new 	concessions....But his 	[Mr. Gandhi’s] 	testimony...is certainly not conclusive.   When Mr. Gandhi goes so far as to accuse Mr. Smuts of  	‘murder’ 	and ‘organized 	robbery’, even those 	who are not unsympathetic 	must feel 	sceptical of his trustworthiness in questions of fact.   Mr. Smuts is the servant of  Parliament 	and any promise 	he may have 	made to Mr. Gandhi 	was necessarily 	subject to 	the ratification 	of the 	legislature.... 	[Accepting Mr. Gandhi’s 	proposal would 	involve] the unrestricted admission.   of the thousands of Indian lads who have been or are being educated in the schools of Natal [or India].   Whatever hardships the  Asiatics 	have suffered they owe entirely to the recalcitrancy and folly of 	their lea- ders...they cannot complain when they are called upon to 	bear the consequences. ” 
 no fresh demand has been made. But, supposing that it was made, would it justify General Smuts in breaking a promise which was to be fulfilled on the condition of voluntary registration being gone thro- ugh by Asiatics, even though that condition had been fulfilled? More- over, if Asiatics ask for anything new, he has undoubtedly a right to refuse it, but surely not on that account to break his promise. What Asiatics grieve over is the fact of the General making the acceptance of educational disqualification a conditionof repeal of the Asiatic Act. Will it not be an honourable course for him to give what he has pro- mised, and then throw the onus on the Asiatics of accepting or rejec- ting it?
 You seem to imagine that, by repeal of the Act, Asiatics desire that there should be nothing of the Asiatic Act retained in any shape or form. So far is this from being true, that, in the draft Immigration Bill repealing the Act and shown to me by the Colonial Secretary, such provisions of the Asiatic Act as were necessary for properly checking certificates already issued and such other things were taken over from it. Asiatics do not oppose supervision, but they do oppose an Act which is based on charges of fraud and which contains many clauses of an objectionable character.
 As to the promise of repeal, you reported General Smuts to have stated on the 6th day of February last that “he had told the Asiatics that he would not repeal the Act until every Asiatic was registered”. I interpret this to amount to a public confirmation of the promise made by him to me on the 30th day of January and repeated on the 3rd day of February last. If the declaration has any other meaning, I confess I do not understand it.
 You resent my having accused General Smuts of the murder of Mr. Naidoo’s child and my having used the expression “legalized robbery” in connection with the Magistrate’s order at Vereeniging to seize the goods of the Indians charged, in lieu of the payment of the fines  imposed  upon  them,libtech_113_footnoteI  witnessed  the  scene  enacted  in  Mrs. Naidoo’s room immediately after her husband’s third incarceration. I cannot forget it. Six days after, I heard that she had a still-born son. Mr. Naidoo had committed no offence save that, first, of helping General Smuts out of an awkward dilemma, and then of preferring his conscience to everything else. Although you may wonder, I must repeat that the death of the child must be laid at the door of General Smuts. Lastly, if a private individual were to take away my goods by violence, the law would call it robbery. When the legal machinery itself is utilized to confiscate my goods and thus to compel me to
 
 surrender my conscience, I may be pardoned for calling the process “legalized robbery”. And yet that is what a forced sale of the goods of those who have done no wrong means to most Indians.

38,"August 12, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”,"
         [JOHANNESBURG,  August 12, 1908] A number 	of the 	leading Transvaal 	Indianlibtech_114_footnoteleft for Charlestown yesterday [August 12] with the intention of crossing the border into the Transvaal without giving evidence of identity.   All of these are domiciled in the Transvaal, and all but  one 	possess voluntary 	registration certificates. They 	will decline to produce 	their registration 	certificates, which must 	be demanded 	in accordance 	with the Asiatic 	Act.    On their refusal to supply particulars required by the Government, these men  will 	be arrested. 	In that 	event they 	will plead guilty to 	the charge 	of refusing 	to comply 	with the provisions 	of the Asiatic 	Act in order that 	they may 	 be imprisoned....  A 	number of other Indians who are qualified to enter the Transvaal 	under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act, but not under the Asiatic 	Amendment Act, will also probably try to enter the Transvaal within 	the next few days....  Mr. 	Gandhi said that the 	Bill will not 	satisfy the 	Asiatic communities, 	because they 	hold that it breaks 	the terms of 	the promises 	made by 	General Smuts 	when the compromise 	was arrived 	at, and that it 	sets up 	two kinds of 	legislation for 	the same class 	of people. 	The Bill 	does not protect 	Asiatics who they 	hold are entitled 	to enter 	the country, 	and have entered 	after the expiry 	of the 	three months appointed 	for voluntary 	registration, and also 	those Asiatics who were 	resident in the 	Transvaal on 	the date of the 	compromise, but 	did not take out voluntary 	registration certificates. 	These Asiatics have, in 	accordance with the 	new Bill, to 	be registered under the 	Asia- tic 	Act. The 	result in 	some cases would be 	peculiar for 	the Asiatics. There are 	cases in 	which sons have taken out 	voluntary registration 	certificates, and fathers 	who were 	not in 	the Colony 	during the three 	months have not done so, 	and would therefore be 	called upon 	to register 	under the old Act. The 	Bill, they 	hold, only 	nominally exem- 	pts Asiatics 	who have voluntarily 	registered from the 	provisions of 	the Act. The 	Asiatics hold 	that there are 	two conditions to 	be fulfilled by 	the Govern-ment 	under the 	compromise. The 	one is that 	to all 	those who 	registered voluntarily 	the Act 	should not 	be applied. 	The other 	is that 	the voluntary 	mode of 	registration should 	apply to those who entered the Transvaal under the terms of the compromise. Both of    
 these conditions, they say, are disregarded. Again, no provision has been made for prewar Asiatic residents who have not yet returned to the Transvaal; such old resi- dents, if they chose to accept the old Asiatic Act, could, under the discre-tionary clause, take out certificates of registration. As such Asiatics will not comply with the terms of the old Act, they will be debarred from entering. The same remarks apply to educated Indians who could enter the Colony under the Immigrants’ Restri-ction Act, but who would become “unregistered” by reason of their non-compliance with the Asiatic Act. “This,” remarked Mr. Gandhi, “is an adroit move, but hardly an honour- able one.” The new Bill the Indians hold to provide separate legislation for one class of people, as it regulates the movements of those Indians who have taken out volun- tary registration certificates and the old Asiatic Act, the move-ments of the others.

The 		members of 		the Association 		have read with much concern the 		Bill published 		in the 		Government Gazette, 		entitled “to 		validate the voluntary 		registration of certain 		Asiatics who failed 		to comply 		with the provisions 		of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act, 1907”.  When 		British Indians undertook to 		take out 		voluntary registration, 		they never 		had any intention 		of submitting to 		the Asiatic Law Amendment 		Act of 1907.

 distinction between the incidents of voluntary registration to be legalized under the said Bill and registration under the Asiatic Act.
  The 	terms of 	the compromise 	as embodied 	in the  letters  that 	passed between the 	Hon’ble the 	Colonial Secretary and 	the Honorary Secretary 	of the 	British Indian 	Association and 	the other co-signa- 	tories were:   all 		Asiatics resident in 		the Colony at 		the time of the 		compromise should take 		out voluntary 		registration certificates 		“say within 		three months” 		from the 		date of 		the compromise.  Children 		under 16 years 		were to be exempt 		from any 		registration.  Such 		mode of registration 		was to 		be applicable to 		those who 		were entitled to 		enter the 		Transvaal but 		who were not 		in the Transvaal 		at the time 		of the compromise.  To 		those who 		submitted to 		voluntary registration, 		Act No. 		2 of 1907 		was not to 		be applied.  The 		voluntary registration 		was to 		be legalized in 		any other 		manner that the Government considered proper.libtech_117_footnote   These 	were supplemented by 	conversations that took 	place at 	interviews granted by 	the Hon’ble 	the Colonial 	Secretary to the 	Honorary Secretary of 	the British Indian Association.  At 	these interviews, the 	question of mode 	of legalization 	was discussed, 	and the Hon’ble 	the Colonial 	Secretary definitely promised 	that, if all the 	Asiatics in the Transvaal submitted 	to voluntary 	registration, the 	said Act 	would be repealed.  The 	said promise 	was referred 	to by the 	Hon’ble the Colonial 	Secretary in one of his speecheslibtech_118_footnotelibtech_119_footnotedelivered at Richmond soon after the compromise.  The 	Petitioners respectfully 	invite the 	attention of 	this Hon’ble 	House to the 	fact that all 	the Asiatics who had 	an opportunity 	of submitting 	to voluntary 	registration have done 	so, and that the others have 	been always ready to do 	so, but voluntary 	registration after the 	9th of 	May has been refused.  The 	Bill before this 	Hon’ble House, 	therefore, is in 	conflict with 	the compromise 	in the following particulars:  It does not repeal the said Act No. 2 of 1907. Whilst 		it seemingly validates voluntary registration under a  
 
 
 separate measure, it does not definitely and unequivocally except voluntary registrants from the operation of the said Act.
   It 		does not 		exempt from 		registration the 		children under 		the age of 		16 years of 		holders of 		voluntary registration 		certificates.  It 		does not 		leave any 		opportunity for 		voluntary registra- 		tion for 		Asiatics referred 		to in Sub-Paragraph 		(c) of 		Paragraph 5 hereof.   The 	Bill is, 	therefore, in 	the humble 	opinion of the 	Petitioning Association, 	in breach 	of the 	terms that 	were to be fulfilled 	by the 	Government.  The 	community represented by 	the Petitioning 	Association has no 	desire to 	take advantage 	of the 	voluntary registration 	certificates that were 	taken out by 	it in good faith.  The 	Petitioning Association 	respectfully invites the 	attention of 	this Hon’ble 	House to the 	fact that, at 	much personal 	sacrifice and 	even  at  the  risk 	  of 	  their  lives,libtech_120_footnoteleading  members  of 	  the  Indian 	community fulfilled 	their part of the compromise.  The 	Petitioning Association 	feels that the Bill before 	this  Hon’ble 	House disregards the 	admittedly valuable help 	rendered to 	the Govern-ment 	of the 	Colony by 	the Association 	in connection 	with the compro-mise.  Your 	Petitioners, therefore, 	humbly pray 	that this Hon’ble 	 House will 	reject the 	Bill, or 	grant such 	other relief as 	to it may seem 	fit and proper.

            DEAR 	SIR,     [JOHANNESBURG,]  August 	14, 1908 
  	I deem it to be my duty to approach you, at the eve of what pro- 	mises, for Indians, to be an interminable struggle. Nearly sixty 	Indians are now undergoing imprisonment with hard labour at the 	Johannesburg Gaol. Over thirty have suffered imprisonment and been 	discharged since the renewal of the struggle. Thirteen Indian 	merchants are at present undergoing imprisonment at Standerton.  	On Sundaylibtech_122_footnotelibtech_123_footnote, we meet to burn registration certificates. The return 	of these certificates up to the time of writing is aboutlibtech_124_footnoteThey  are  	still pouring in, and, by Sunday, it is highly probable that we will 	have at least fifteen hundred. I do not know that all those are true 	men [who] would fight to the last and suffer every form of hardship. 	The giving of their certificates is an earnest.  	The    Chairmanlibtech_125_footnotethe 	   Natal    Indian    Congress    Durban,    the Chairmanlibtech_126_footnoteof   the   British   Indian   League,   Cape   	Town,   the   Vice Presidentlibtech_127_footnoteof the Natal In-dian Congress and the Joint 	Secretarylibtech_128_footnoteof 	the Natal Indian Congress, each representing a different faith or 	clan of India, accompanied by a few indentured Indian and a few who 	claim pre-war residence are today at the border either to be 	arrested and impresoned, or to be passed unchal-lenged.  	In my opinion, these facts represent strong, [gen]uine and 	invincible opposition to the Asiatic Act, and I am right in assuming 	that you do not intend to deal unjustly by those who are entitled to 	reside in the Transvaal. Thelibtech_129_footnotedifference between you, as representing the 	Government, and the British Indians is very small indeed. I appeal 	to you once more, therefore, to revert to the draft Immigrants’      A. 	Cartwright”, 9-7-1908 The certificates were ultimately burnt at 	the mass meeting of August 16.       
 Restriction Bill that was shown to me, and to accept the amendments suggested by me, leaving the question of educated  Indians open, unless you can bring yourself to so amend the Act as to keep the door open for educated Indians being professional or University men. I ask you to study carefully the petitionlibtech_130_footnotelibtech_131_footnoteto be presented to the House, and to answer to yourself whether the Bill published does not break the compromise in almost every particular. I ask you, then, to go back to the interviews we had before voluntary registration started, and to what you used to say. I ask you further to accept my assurance that there is absolutely no wish on my part or on the pat of the leaders of the Indian community to seek for anything more than fair treatment of those who are bona-fide residents of the country.
 If the proposal above made by me is not acceptable to you, I venture to suggest that you see a few Indian leaders and come to an acceptable arrangement which will carry out the spirit of the compromise and end a painful situation. If you cannot do either, I am afraid that the resolve to burn the certificates at the Mass Meeting on Sunday must be carried out. The sole responsibility for the advice rests on my shoulders.

42,,WHAT IF GOODS ARE AUCTIONED,"
  
 Vereeniging Indians were not sentenced to imprisonment but were only asked to pay a fine. The Magistrate ordered the recovery of the fine, if not paid, by the auctioning of their goods. There is no provision in the Licences Act for this [procedure] but the Magistrate has this power under another law.
 What pleases one is that Indians have not been alarmed by this order; on the contrary, they have been able to see that what has happened is better.
 This suggests that real wealth consists in poverty, for the rich cannot hold out against the Government as well as the poor can. The rich will be afraid. We congratulate the Vereeniging Indians on their informing the Magistrate that they would rather have their goods auctioned than pay the fine. We do not think the slightest harm will befall them if their goods are auctioned. To be sure, the goods of some traders will be so auctioned. But we certainly cannot argue that there will be no loss of money in case of imprisonment. We should not therefore be afraid of similar loss through auctioning of goods. The fact is that, as hundreds of men cannot be imprisoned, equally, the goods of hundreds of traders cannot be auctioned. The Government does not have the requisite facilities. It would lose its prestige if it did so and might even be ousted from power.
 Moreover, there is nothing that the Government can get out of hawkers. No Indian is bound to produce his goods for auction. The Government may, if it wants, search for a person’s goods. It will grow tired of doing so and then hawkers will be absolutely free to go about their business without licences. The Government will find itself in the position of the woman who went out in search of her son and lost her husband. Coveting the goods, the Government will even miss the opportunity of sending people to gaol, with the result that Indians will grow more determined. This being the case, no Indian need be alarmed. When the Government seeks a settlement, Indians, if they have the courage, can demand compensation for those whose goods were auctioned.
 This campaign in the Transvaal is of the greatest importance to Indians. Natal should watch it carefully. The Natal Act does not provide for imprisonment in the matter of licences. Only goods can be auctioned. From [the events in] the Transvaal, Natal Indians will see that the campaign has been made much easier by the auctioning of goods. If hawkers really hold out against the Government, they can
 compel it to yield. That is why true poverty means true wealth. What true poverty is, we shall consider on another occasion. For the present, Indians must bear in mind the need to endure the hardships, whatever they be.

Mr. Essop Ismail Mia presided over this vast gathering.     beyond that, a sea of upturned and expectant faces, with determination and a bitter merriment stamped deep.  . 	. .

Haloo who, 	it will be remembered, registered under the Act, now publicly burnt 	his badge of slavery, and poured oil upon the flames. . . .  MR. GANDHI’S 	SPEECH  	The responsibility that devolves upon me this afternoon is a very 	serious responsibility. I have been taken to task, in connection 	with the advice that I have been giving to my fellow-countrymen for 	some length of time, by friends. I have been ridiculed by those who 	do not profess to be friends, and, yet, after due consideration, 	and, shall I say,     
 prayer also, the advice that I ventured to give to my fellow-country- men 1 am going to repeat this afternoon, and that advice is that, as events have taken the turn that you know in connection with our struggle, we must burn our certificates. [Applause.] I am told that I may be instrumental in imposing on my countrymen untold suffering because of the advice that I have given, if they follow that advice. I know that well, but I do know this also, that, if the burning of the certificates will impose untold suffering on you, the keeping of these certificates and submission to the Asiatic Act or to the Validation Bill that is to be read a second time tomorrow will impose on my country- men untold indignity, and I say with the greatest emphasis at my command that I would far rather that my countrymen suffered all they have to suffer than that they imposed on themselves indignity. Further, my countrymen here in the Transvaal have taken a solemn oath not to submit to the Asiatic Act. The solemn oath was taken not merely to be fulfilled to the letter but in spirit also, and if you were so ill advised by me, or by anybody else, that you may accept the Voluntary Asiatic Registration Validation Bill and flatter yourselves with the belief that you have escaped the Asiatic Act, I should call myself a traitor to my countrymen, a traitor to God, a traitor to my oath. I shall do no such thing, no matter what suffering may be imposed on you by reason of burning your certificates, but, if you do burn your certificates, please bear in mind that you are not to take advantage of the certificates at any time whatsoever until a proper and just and honourable settlement has been arrived at. It is open to you to take copies tomorrow of the certificates that may be burned to ashes today by paying 5 s, I dare say that the Government will give you copies of these certificates even free of charge because the Bill has not yet become law, but, if there is any Indian in this vast assemblage who wants to take out a copy of that certificate, and today wishes to burn the certificate either out of shame or false modesty or any other  reason of a similar nature, then I say emphatically let him step forward and say he does not want his certificate to be burned, but if it is your solemn resolution that you will not go to the Government to ask for a copy of the certificate, then I say, you have well done. Before this resolution was arrived at at the Committee meeting of the  British Indian Association, you had already sent to gaol several Indians. Mr. Sorabjee, all honour to him, came from Charlestown to fight your battle. (‘Hear! hear !’) Several Indians, humble folks amongst us, went to Johannesburg Fort in order that they might serve their countrymen, in order that their suffering might appeal to the Government, in order that we might be able to live in this Colony with self-respect and dignity. Does it behove any of us to keep the voluntary registration
 certificates, to sit tight on those certificates, and allow our poorer countrymen or those of our countrymen who happened to enter the country after the expiry of the three months to go to gaol or to expect them to accept the Asiatic Act? I say emphatically, no. I did not come out of the gaol before my time was up in order that I might leave the hardships that I was suffering there—personally, I was not undergoing any hardships whatever. It would be a far greater hardship to me to have to submit to indignity or to see a fellow-countryman trampled underfoot or his bread, to which he is justly entitled, taken away from him. I would pass the whole of my lifetime in gaol, and I say that in the House of God, in the House of Prayer, and I repeat it that I would far rather pass the whole of my lifetime in gaol and be perfectly happy than see my fellow- countrymen subjected to indignity and I should come out of the gaol. No, gentlemen, the servant who stands before you this afternoon is not made of that stuff, and it is because I ask you to suffer everything that may be necessary than break your oath, it is because I expect this of my country-men, that they will be, above all, true to their God, that I ask you this afternoon to burn all these certificates. (Cries of ‘we are ready to burn them’.) I have been told that the statement I have made lately with reference to the position of British Indians in this Colony has been misconstrued. I have read some remarks that have been passed upon that statement, and it is this: that I claim that this country belongs to British Indians just as much as it belongs to the Europeans—and I claim that claim, but what does that claim mean? I do not, therefore, mean that it is open to us to have an unchecked influx of Asiatics into this country. No, I claim to be a Colonist, I claim to have passed a fair measure of my life in this country, and if this country, the welfare of this country, demands that Asiatic immigration should not  proceed  unchecked, then I should be the first man to say, let that be so. If the majority of the inhabitants of this country demand that Asiatic immigration should cease—mind, I lay stress upon the term immigration—if Asiatic immigration should be under well-ordered control, then I say that I should also accept that position, but having accepted that  position, I should claim that this country is just as much mine as any other Colonist’s, and it is in that sense that I put forward that claim on behalf of my countrymen and I say also that it behoves the Colonists to recognize that claim. It cannot benefit the Colonists to have British Indians in the Transvaal who are not men but who may be treated as cattle even though it may be showcattle. It will not do the Colonists any good, it will not do British Indians any good, and if that is the position that the Colonists or the British Indians take in this Colony, it will be far better that Indians are hunted out of this Colony and sent to
 India to carry their tale of woe to India rather than that they should remain in this Colony in the most humiliating position. It is in that sense that I claim that this country is just as much the British Indian’s as it is the European’s. What is this fight that we are engaged upon? What is its significance? To my mind, its significance did not commence with a demand for the repeal of the Asiatic Act, nor does it end with the repeal of the Asiatic Act. I know full well that it is open to the Government of the Colony to give a repeal of this legislation today, to throw dust into our eyes and then embark upon other legislation, far harsher, far more humiliating, but the lesson that I wanted to learn myself, the lesson I would have my countrymen to learn from this struggle is this: that unenfran-chised though we are, unrepresented though we are in the Transvaal, it is open to us to clothe ourselves with an undying franchise, and this consists in recognizing our humanity, in recognizing that we are part and parcel of the great universal whole, that there is the Maker of us all ruling over the destinies of mankind and that our trust should be in Him rather than in earthly kings, and if my countrymen recognize that position I say that no matter what legislation is passed over our heads, if that legislation is in conflict with our ideas of right and wrong, if it is in conflict with our conscience, if it is in conflict with our religion, then we can say we shall not submit to that legislation. We use no physical force, but we accept the sanction that the legislature provides,  we accept the penalties that the legislature provides. I refuse to call this defiance, but I consider that it is a perfectly respectful attitude, for a man, for a human being who calls himself man. And it is because it was necessary that British Indians should learn that lesson that the heads of the community gathered together and assembled together and said to themselves that this is the struggle, this is the method of struggle that they would place before their countrymen. It can do no harm whatsoever to the Government of the Colony, it can do no harm to those who are engaged in this struggle; it simply tests them and, if they are true, then they can only win; if they are not true, then they simply get what they deserve. One thing more and I shall soon ask you whether you propose that Mr. Essop Mia, your Chairman, should set fire to these registration certificates; and it is this: I have been hitherto refraining from making any personal attack whatsoever. I did make a slight attack at the time of the trial of Ram Sundar, and that was in connection with the head of the Registration Department, Mr. Chamney.libtech_137_footnotelibtech_138_footnoteI  feel  bound  in  the  inter-ests  of  the  Colonists,  in   the interests of the Indian community, and for the honour of the Colony,
 
 to make this remark, that, so long as Mr. Chamney reigns supreme in the Registration Department, there will be no peace so far as the Asiatics   are   concerned.libtech_139_footnotelibtech_140_footnoteI   accused   Mr.   Chamney   of   hopeless incompetence and ignorance after so much experience. Again, after the charge was made, I repeat it. When I come to contrast what he has been doing with what Captain Hamilton Fowlelibtech_141_footnotelibtech_142_footnotedid I can only say that, had Captain Hamilton Fowle been at the helm of affairs, we would not be face to face with a difficulty of this nature which not only stares the Indian community in the face but which stares the Government also in the face. Mr. Chamney is an estimable man, as I have often stated. He is above suspicion, but that is not all that is required in the head of a Department. The head of a Department has to know his work, he has to know the law that he wishes to administer, or the administration of which is given to him, and he has also to keep a cool head, and he has to be competent in the proper discharge of his duties. Mr. Chamney has been tried, and has been found wanting, and no matter how much attached General Smuts may be to Mr. Chamney, this is the charge that I can bring against him after very close acquaintance with the working of his Department. I cannot go into the illustration of the proposition that I lay down, but I do say that, unless Mr. Chamney is removed from that Department—I have no desire that anybody’s  bread should be taken away from his mouth—but, unless he is  removed from this Department, there will be no peace. But what is more, Mr. Chamney has been less than a man in putting his signature before a justice of the Peace to an affidavit that was made on oath to the effect that he was present on the interview on the 3rd day of February and General Smuts never promised repeal of the Act. I say that that affidavit is untrue. He not only listened to the promise made by General Smuts as to the repeal of the Act, but he repeated that promise to me; he mentioned that promise to me, if once, twelve times, and each time he said that General Smuts was going to play the game, that he was going to repeal the Act. There was once an occasion when  I believe there was a fellow-countryman of mine in my company and he said, ‘But remember that General Smuts also said that so long as there is a single Asiatic in the Colony who has not made a voluntary registration application that Act will be enforced against him’. Today the position is that there is no Asiatic, so far as I know, none to talk of, who has not made his application for voluntary registration. I now ask
 
 for a fulfilment of that promise, and if Mr. Chamney has made that affidavit, as he has made it, why, he has added some other disqualifica- tion to the disqualifications I have named, and I say again that unless Mr. Chamney is removed from that Department there cannot be any peace whatsoever.

 NEGOTIATIONS FOR SETTLEMENT
 I apologize to the readers for writing a short letter this time. There is plenty to say, but I cannot spare even a moment. I, therefore, give the latest news first.
 Mr. Gandhi was informed at 11 p.m. on Monday that he was wanted by General Smuts. He accordingly went to see the General on Tuesday morning. Mr. Cartwright and Mr. Quinn were also called. There was a discussion for three hours with General Botha, General Smuts, Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, Sir George Farrar, Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Hosken and Mr. Chaplin participating. In the end the Government agreed to the following terms.
 The 	Act shall not 	be applicable 	to Turkish Mahomedans.  Those 	who can prove that they had resided 	in the 	Transvaal for 	three years before the [Boer] War shall be permitted to enter.  For 	children under 	sixteen years 	registration shall not 	be necessary.  When 	taking out a 	licence, either 	a well-formed 	signature or a 	thumb-impression shall 	be given.  An 	appeal can 	be made 	to a 	magistrate [against the 	decision of 	the Registrar of 	Asiatics] and 	to the Supreme 	Court against 	the magistrate’s decision. The Sectionlibtech_144_footnotelibtech_145_footnoterelating to intoxicating drinks shall be deleted.  The 	obnoxious law 	will be 	retained, but 	only as 	a dead letter and 	it shall not apply to voluntary registrants or to those who may register 
 
 of their own accord in future.
 The deficiencylibtech_146_footnotelibtech_147_footnotein section 21 shall be rectified.  Those 	who have 	taken out 	registers under the 	obnoxious law 	shall be 	allowed to 	apply for 	new ones. 
 A meeting was held on Tuesday evening to consider  these points.
 A large number of persons were present. It was decided in the end to convene a meetinglibtech_148_footnoteon Thursday, and invite persons from all parts [of the Colony] to it.
 STANDERTON HEROES
 
 They were released this morning. Mr. Essop Mia, Mr. Bawazeer and others went from here to receive them [at the gaol gate].  A meeting was held after their release. Resolutions were passed at the meeting to the effect that the campaign should be continued to the bitter end, whatever the cost. A large number of certificates were collected at the meeting and sent to the Association for being burnt. Leaders from Heidelberg, Vereeni-ging, Krugersdorp and other places also took part in the proceedings.

46,"August 	20, 1908",46. LETTER TO E. F.C. LANElibtech_149_footnote,"
   PRIVATE       DEAR 	MR. LANE,    JOHANNESBURG,  August 	20, 1908 
 Mr. 	Cartwright told me that I should write to you what I told     Writing 	of these events from Yeravda jail some 15 years later, Gandhiji 	perhaps mistook his letter of August 14, 1908 to General Smuts 	(“Letter to General Smuts”, 14-8-1908) for this letter, and the 	mass meeting of August 16 (“Speech at Mass Meeting”, 16-8-1908) 	for that held on August 23 (“Speech at Mass Meeting”, 	23-8-1908). The following excerpts from Chapters XXVI and XXVII of 	Satyagraha in South 	Africa compared with 	extracts from contemporary statements or reports (in square brackets 	below), may throw some light on the genesis of this confusion.  	“The 	weekly diary in Indian 	Opinion, asked 	[Indians] to hold themselves in  readiness 	to burn the certificates if the Black Act was not repealed. [cf. 	“Johannesburg Letter”, 	18-7-1908. “A 	mass meeting 	will be 	held on 	Sunday” (July 19, 	1908). “Registers 	will not 	be burnt, 	not yet...the 	wisest course will be 	to wait till General 	Smuts publishes his 	draft bill”. The 	draft bill was 	published on 	August 11; 	vide “New 	Bill”, 15-8-1908]. 	The bill was about 	to pass 	through the 	Legislature to 	which a 	petition [dated August 	13, 1908, 	“Petition to Transvaal 	Legislative Assembly”, 13-8- 	1908] was presented...in 	vain. At 	last an 	ultimatum was 	sent to the 	Government by 	the satyagrahis. 	The word 	was not the satyagrahis’ 	but of 	General Smuts 	who thus chose 	to style 	the letter. 	. . [Gandhiji himself 	preferred to call it an 	“Asiatic submission” 	rather than an “Asiatic ultimatum”(“Interview to “The 	Transvaal Leader”, 21-8-1908).The word “ultimatum” is not 	found in the text of General Smuts’ speech in the 	Transvaal Legislative 	Assembly of August 	21 as reported 	in Indian 	Opinion. He did, 	however, mention 	the letter 	which, he 	said, disappointed 	his hopes of 	a  settlement. For 	an abbreviated text of 	speech, vide 	Appendix X. This word 	was used in Indian 	Opinion as a 	title for 	Essop Mia’s letter to 	the Colonial 	Secretary of July 	6, 1908 	(“Letter to 	Colonial Secretary”, 	6-7-1908) and later 	to describe 	this letter of 	August 20.] One reason 	why this letter 	was held to 	be an ultimatum was 	that it 	prescribed a 	time-limit for 	a reply. [Neither the 	letter of 	August 14 	(“Letter to 	General Smuts”, 	14-8-1908) which Gandhi speaks as 	the “ultimatum”, nor 	the letter of 	August 20 which appeared in Indian Opinion under the title “What Is an Ultimatum?” 
 him as to the decision of the meeting today, and to give my impressions also.
 I placed before the meetinglibtech_150_footnotelibtech_151_footnote, for the third time today, the terms that I told them the Government were prepared to offer, and I told them further that these would form an acceptable  compromise,  if some provision was made for highly educated Indians and Mr. Sorabjee’s re-instatement; but the meeting would not listen to anything short of repeal of the Asiatic Act and the recognition of highly educated Indians under the general clause of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act. All I could persuade them to accept was that, the statutory right being recognized, there would be no objection to an administrative discrimination against educated Indians so that only the most highly educated Indians could enter. The meeting was most enthusiastic, and what was intended to be a meeting for a few delegates only became a general mass meeting. It was attended by three of the most eminent Indianslibtech_152_footnotelibtech_153_footnotein South Africa, who have, as you know, come over from Natal, but who were pre-war residents and who had a large stake in the country before the war. Most of the influential Indians from Pretoria who have submitted to the Act also came and sympathized. After much difficulty, I was able to persuade the  meeting to unanimously agree to the following:
 Mr. 	Sorabjee to be re-instated, with full residential rights. All 	prisoners to 	be discharged. The 	Asiatic Act 	to be repealed.  A 	general education test, 	with discretionary 	power as to its 	severity regarding 	educated Indians. 
 
 prescribes any time-limit. Was there a further letter by the satyagrahis, which has not been traced?]...The ultimatum was to expire on the same day the bill was to be carried through the Legislature. [The first reading of the Asiatics’ Voluntary Registration Validation Bill in the Legislative Assembly was on August 13. This Bill was, according to Indian Opinion, subsequently dropped and an amended Bill, which made further concessions to the Asiatics, was passed finally by the Legislative Council on August 22.] A meeting had been called some two hours after the expiry of the time-limit to hold the public ceremony of burning the certificates. [Registration certificates were burnt at both the mass meetings of August 16 and 23, 1908.] We had all reached the place of meeting early and arranged for the Government’s reply by wire... the meeting was held at 4 o’clock on the grounds of the Hamidia Mosque at Johannesburg (August 16, 1908) A volunteer arrived with a telegram from the
 Government in which they... announced their inability to change their line of action.”
  The terms as per [Sir] Percy’slibtech_154_footnotelibtech_155_footnotenotes to be embodied with the 	necessary changes in the new Bill. Free 	re-issue of burnt certificates.  The 	essential clauses 	of the 	Asiatic Act, in 	so far as 	they may 	be necessary 	for a 	proper check 	over the Asiatic 	population and for prevention of fraud, to be re-enacted in the new Bill.  The 	draft Bill to be shown 	to the Committee of the 	Association for suggestions as to details. 
 It will be seen that this submission does not materially alter the terms as per Sir Percy’s notes. I cannot see any difficulty in showing the Parliament and the country that repeal of the Act is simply a graceful act to soothe an unrepresented community in the Colony, without in any way relaxing the hold of the legislature on that class.
 The Sorabjee incident raised the enthusiasm of the people to a white heat. It caused intense irritation. I assure you that the meeting as  a whole went much further than I should ever care to go under the present circumstances, but it was by my deliberate promise to lead them in passive resistance if the promised repeal was not granted that I could persuade them to restrict the community to the above terms. I was disinclined to impose on my countrymen further suffering and was, therefore, prepared to waive a substantial repeal of the Act, so far as it became inoperative against all save those who had accepted it; but I am glad to say they would not listen to it, and they said they were prepared to suffer to the uttermost. I hope, therefore, that the Government will be pleased to accept the above terms and close the controversy. If they do, 1, for one, shall refuse to go any further so far as the Asiatic Act is concerned.
 One thing more one speaker actually got up and suggested that the terms should include a clause asking for Mr. Chamney’s removal. It was, however, not embodied in the terms; but I cannot help  recording my opinion that Mr. Chamney is ignorant and hopelessly incompetent. This I say in the interests of the Colony at large. I have personally nothing against him. I have always received courtesy from him, but in spite of all my efforts to the contrary, I have not been able to see any competence in him for the office he holds. I am sure that he never knows from one hour to another what his decision should be, and the largest amount of irritation was caused in the initial stages of the working of voluntary registration purely through his vacillation and ill-considered decisions. I could give several instances, but I do
 
 not think it is necessary. In my opinion, what is required is a man of judicial talent and wide sympathies. If this suggestion is not accepted,  I fear that there will always be irritation and consequent difficulty in the administration of any Act however well devised.
I am sending copies to the Progressive leaders.

47,"August 	20, 1908",SPEECH AT CLOSER UNION SOCIETY,"
         [JOHANNESBURG,  August 	20, 1908]  The 	first meeting of the Transvaal Closer Union Society was held in the 	Congre-gational Church Hall, Bree Street, last night [August 20], 	Mr. Edward Nathan presiding. The subject of debate was “The 	Asiatic Question in Relation to Closer Union”, Mr. Alfred Barker’s 	papers, which appeared in the Leader 	on Monday and Tuesday 	last, forming the basis of discussion.  After 	Mr. Barker 	had read 	his papers, 	Mr. M. K. Gandhi 	said he thought 	it was 	com-mon ground between 	both Europeans 	and Asiatics 	in South 	Africa that Asiatic 	immigration should be 	controlled or 	restricted, and 	it was 	so controlled 	or restricted. 	In the Gape Colony 	and in 	Natal there was 	a law with this object, 	and in the 	Transvaal, too, 	there was a closed door. 	Rhodesia had already an 	Immigration Restriction 	Law, and 	her legislators were 	now endeavouring 	to place an Asiatic 	Registration law 	on the 	Statute-book.libtech_156_footnotePersonally, he 	did not think they needed 	that law at 	all; they had 	achieved their object by 	passing the 	immigration law. 	That narrowed the 	question down very materially, and one had now to consider the 	effect of the residence 	of Asiatics 	on Closer 	Union, and not the effect 	of the 	immigration of 	Asiatics.  THE 	IMMIGRATION 	LAW  The 	immigration law 	of the 	Cape and of Natal 	allowed the 	entry of Asiatics 	who could 	pass the same education 	test that was imposed 	on others 	who might 	enter the 	country. The 	object of 	that legislation was 	principally to 	guard against the 	influx of Asiatics. In 1896, the late Mr. Escombe first approached Mr. Chamberlain for    
 permis-sion to pass an Asiatic Exclusion Bill, and Mr. Chamberlain laid down the policy, for the guidance of all the Colonies, that the basis of distinction should not be colour, but education or some such qualification. That policy had been hitherto followed. At the Conference of Prime Ministers, Mr. Chamberlain placed that view before them for their acceptance. Very few Asiatics had been able to enter Natal under the education test, not because India did not possess a large number of educated Indians, but because the educated Asiatics had ample scope for their abilities in India, China, and Japan; but there were some who undoubtedly must follow the traders, hawkers, and other classes of Asiatics. If they could not come to South Africa, and if the door was effectually shut even against them, the solution of the question would be far more difficult than it would otherwise be. If it were admitted that those Asiatics who had been domiciled in South Africa should remain in South Africa and should obtain fair treatment, it was natural that those who could lead them and who could act as interpreters between the races must also be allowed to come. What was to be the position of those Asiatics who were allowed to remain in South Africa? The people who had settled in South Africa had laid down certain conditions under which the nation that was now forming had to live. Was it possible, then, to eradicate from one’s mind the problem of Asiatic residence? It was a very interesting and instructive study; but it passed his comprehension that in all the papers he had read from the pens of those who had made South Africa their home they had never taken into consideration what the feelings of the Asiatics or of the Natives themselves might be. What would they have to say to any solution that was suggested for their acceptance? Was it suggested that the Asiatics or the Coloured races must perforce accept any solution which was found for their treatment by the predominant race—the European race? He ventured to suggest that if they ever adopted that policy it was doomed to failure. It was possible, perhaps, for one, two, or three years to follow a policy of that nature; but he was certain they would find that both the Asiatics and the Natives would demand to be consulted with reference to their disposition. It was impossible to conceive that those races would ever allow the predominant race to dispose of them just as they chose.
 INDENTURED LABOUR
 Mr. Barker had first of all discussed the question of indentured immigration.
The speaker observed:
 There we are absolutely on common ground. I have said in season and out of season, whenever I have had the opportunity, that it is undoubtedly the introduction of indentured labour into Natal that has made the Asiatic question in South Africa possible at all. It was the introduction of indentured labour that was followed by  free emigration of Asiatics from India. It was because Natal committed a very serious blunder in admitting indentured labour that posterity has to suffer, if it has to suffer. But the solution does not lie in compulsory repatriation. To my mind, it offends the feelings of
 humanity to suggest that a body of people should be allowed to enter a particular Colony to which they should give the best years of their then be sent back to a place which has become comparatively strange to them. The people who have been invited to go to Natal under indenture are drawn from the poorer classes. They break off all connection with India when they emigrate to Natal. They are told that they will have all comforts and convenience; they believe that they will be able to pass their time in comparative ease, that they will be able, after slaving away for the Colonies for five years, to work for themselves independently. If those men were invited, or were even told in India that at the end of five years they should go back to India, it is possible that they, not knowing the conditions, might accept those conditions, but I do not call that an equitable contract. If those men, knowing the conditions, came to Natal, I would even suggest that it would be inhuman to expect them to go back, or to repatriate them.
 FOR THE PLANTERS’ BENEFIT
 The better policy would be to stop indentured labour entirely; and three years should be the period fixed. If I were an autocrat in Natal, I would fix not even three years, but stop it entirely. This kind of labour has not done any good whatsoever to the Indians who have emigrated under those conditions to Natal, or to the Colonies themselves. It has undoubt-edly benefited a few planters but they have benefited at the expense of the Colonists, and in the  Colonists  I venture to include my own countrymen also. If the Colony persists in that policy, I should admire General Smuts or anyone else using the steamrollerlibtech_157_footnotelibtech_158_footnote(Laughter.)  and  compelling   Natal   to   stop   indentured immigration. That is a question of practical politics, a question of humanity, and a question upon which you will have a consen-sus of opinion not only among Europeans, but you will have every assis- tance possible from the Indians themselves. The question of traders who are domiciled in South Africa and the question of industrial Indians who have risen to the training point become comparatively easy of solution. The bugbear of an Asiatic influence will then have vanished.
 Continuing, Mr. Gandhi alluded to Mr. Barker’s proposal to confine Asiatic traders to Bazaars, and maintained that that would not solve the difficulty. If the Asiatics would not consent to have their trading activity thus restricted, what remedy could Mr. Barker suggest? He was certain that the people of South Africa had no desire to treat British Indians as if they were less than human beings. They must take the Indians into their confidence. As to the franchise, personally he did not wish to
 
 receive it until the barrier of prejudice was broken down. The solution of the  difficulty, to his mind, lay in the fact that the Indians should first of all be recognized as human beings, as fellow-subjects. Europeans should consider it their duty to raise those men and not level them down. (Applause.) It was not fair to treat South Africa as    a white South Africa. There could be no question of segregation or restriction of their trading activities if they were to be treated as a Christian nation would treat them. The only solution was the one he had suggested.

  "
49,"August 21, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 Before August 21, 1908]libtech_162_footnoteThere is a great deal of misunderstanding regarding the Indian position on  the question of  the admission of  educated Indians. We
 contend that the Immigrants’ Restriction Law, as it stands, does not debar educated Indians from entering the country, but nothing can be further from the Indian thought[sic] than that hundreds of Indian youth should be able to come into the country. All that we want is that the colour of the skin should not act as a ‘bar sinister’, and that professional Indians, who are necessarily required for the organic growth of the community, should be allowed to enter. This may not be even at the rate of one per year, because there will be no scope for many such men. They certainly cannot compete in trade, and, after all is said and done, the Asiatic question is very largely a trade question. What is, however, lost sight of is that it is not the Indians who have raised the education question, but it is General Smuts who wishes them to accept his reading of the law. He does not care to consult Indians when he wishes to pass any offensive legislation concer-ning them, but when it is a matter of fulfilling the Government’s part of the compromise he, in effect, says, ‘I shall fulfil the compromise if you accept this additional disability in the shape of a prohibition of the entry of educated Indians, no matter what their qualifications may be.’ It is quite open to him to fulfil the promise of repeal of the Act, and at the same time in disregard of our sentiments to bring in the educational disqualification, and we will fight that question on its own merits. He has not consulted us with reference to the present Bill, which, to my mind, is a breach of the compromise on the part of the government, and yet he refuses to pass a Bill which he had actually drafted repealing the Act because we object to a clause in it which, among others, disqualifies educated Indians.

  "
50,"August 	21, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE STAR”libtech_163_footnote,"
           [JOHANNESBURG, 
  August 	21, 1908] The Asiatic community of 	the Transvaal will not accept the new Bill concerning voluntary 	registration introduced by the Colonial Secretary yesterday. Passive 	resistance must, therefore, continue.  This 	policy was 	laid down in a 	statement made 	by Mr. 	M. K. Gandhi, the spokesman of the community, in an interview with a representative of The Star today. The new Bill, save for two things, would have been considered fairly satisfactory 	to my countrymen, but the non-repeal of the Asiatic  	Act of 1907 and the absence of provision for highly educated 	Asiatics to reside in the Transvaal are vital to its acceptance by 	the Asiatics. The question of the repeal is a very important one 	from the Indians’ standpoint. They claim that repeal was promised 	and that a point of honour should have been granted. As a question 	of practical politics, having studied the new Bill, I can see no 	reason for keeping on the Statute-book the Asiatic Act as a perfect 	dead letter. It will give rise to many a humorous situation. If my 	reading of the Bill is correct, an Asiatic has the option of 	applying under the old Act or under the new Bill. If he wishes to 	take advantage—if advantage it be—of the old Act and enter the 	Colony before making his application, no one can prevent him. But 	under the new Bill he cannot apply for registration except from a 	place outside the Transvaal in South Africa. This strikes me as 	being ludicrous, and it opens the door to fraudulent practices which 	all parties want to prevent.  A SUPREME 	QUESTION  	The question of the introduction of highly educated Indians is also 	of supreme importance to us but, as far as I can see, of none to the 	Europeans. It must not be forgotten that British Indians were 	absolutely free to enter the Colony before the war. After the war 	the entry of educated Asiatics was not prohibited, but they were 	subject to the Peace Preservation Ordinance just as any European 	was. The Asiatic Act of 1907 dealt only with domiciled Asiatics. It 	did not regulate Asiatic immigration, as General Smuts himself 	admitted. The Immigration Act does not, even now, prohibit the entry 	of Asiatics who can pass the education test. Prohibition, therefore, 	has been    
 brought about by the presence of the Asiatic Act to which British Indians will not submit.
 Surely then if we are restricting ourselves to the entry of highly educated Indians, it is we who give up something and not the legislature that will give us a new privilege. It is, therefore, prepos- terous to say that we are setting forth a new demand. The other points, in what has been called the Asiatic Ultimatumlibtech_164_footnotelibtech_165_footnote, and what I would call the Asiatic submission, are really not matters of law but of adminis- trative act. The recall of Sorabjee, we have humbly maintained, is a matter on which the Government should have yielded. The other  points are too insignificant to be dealt with. All I feel is that for these small matters an otherwise admirable Bill will be wrecked, so far as I can judge. My countrymen will not accept the benefit of the provisions of the new Bill until the wrong I have referred to has been redressed and passive resistance will, therefore, unfortunately, have to go on. I have been advised not to lead the passive resistance trouble, but I cannot possibly as one who prefers, or tries to prefer, his conscience to everything else-accept the advice, no matter what the consequences may be.

51,"August 21, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 August 21, 1908]
 Interviewed yesterday [August 21] in regard to the new Bill, Mr. Gandhi said:
 The Bill, I must admit, is a vast improvement on the Validating Bill, which would undoubtedly have been a violation of almost all the terms of the compromise. It embodies, from a cursory glance at the summary published in The Star, the points which were discussed at the interview with the meeting of Het Volk and Progressive leaders. 1 am afraid, however, that it falls short of the terms proposed by the Asiatic Conference. It is a most unfortunate thing that the Government have not seen their way to grant the very limited concessions asked for by the Conference-namely, repeal of the Asiatic Amendment Act, and admission of highly educated Indians. The two points are most important for British Indians, but in my opinion of little importance from the Colonists’ standpoint. Personally, knowing the law and its effect, I could reconcile myself to the present Bill standing side by
 
 side with the Asiatic Act of 1907 as a mere dead letter, but my countrymen cannot understand the intricate distinction. To them no law is a dead letter, and the fervour with which they spoke on the point at the Conference on Thursday last demonstrated to me the depth of feeling regarding the Bill. When, therefore, we offer that the essential clauses of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act so far as they might be necessary for a proper check on the Asiatic population might be re-enacted, I certainly cannot see any reason for not granting the repeal of the Act. It is true that as there has been so much controversy over the Act the Colonists may demand its retention on the Statute-book with just as much pressure as my countrymen demand its repeal, but the representatives of the European Colonists are enlightened enough to see without difficulty that, if the purposes of the Colony can be served equally well by repeal of the Act, they should have no objection to such repeal.
 The question of recognizing the rights of highly educated Indians is also equally simple. There is no demand for an unrestricted influx even of educated Indians. British Indians think that fullest discretionary powers should be reserved to the Colonial Secretary as to the administration of the Act, but do say, and I think with perfect justice, that between Europeans and Asiatics of high attainments there should be no distinction.
 It would be a thousand pities to wreck an otherwise good Bill and to keep up Asiatic discontent for the sake of these minor points.
 The other matters are really matters of detail and not touching the Bill itself. It would be, in my opinion, highly unjust to expect my countrymen to sacrifice Mr. Sorabji, who has suffered for his country, but the Government have made it a matter of principle that  Mr.  Sorabji, having entered in defiance of the law, should suffer  the penalty. He has suffered the penalty by being  imprisoned  for  a month, but—to follow it up with a deportation—if Mr. Sorabji should be sent out of the country because he was under a removal order, so was I and many another Indian, but the Government have  been pleased not to touch us.
 I notice a statement to the effect that we are daily growing more and more impudent in our requests. This is rather a nice way of emphasizing what is contrary to fact. The request for repeal of the Act is as old as the Act itself, and if I personally was prepared to place before my countrymen the question of another Bill provided that the Act became a dead letter, surely that cannot be described as impudent; for my countrymen’s rejection of any such proposal was in that they have all through fought for repeal of the Act. A general education test
 has become necessary, because of the interpretation placed upon the Immigration Restriction Act by the Colonial Secretary, and he knows well that repeal of the Asiatic Act makes the entry of educated Indians perfectly possible under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act. I therefore fail to see any impudence at all. On the con-trary, I make bold to say that the legislature have first of all stripped us naked, and then propose to dole out what they call concessions little by little, still refusing to return what to us is the main thing, and then exclaim, ‘How magnanimous!’ If, therefore, the very moderate request of my country[men] is not embodied in the new Bill, I very much fear, though I am very sorry, that the passive resistance will be resumed. General Smuts calls it a state of anarchy, lawlessness, and a declaration of war.libtech_166_footnotelibtech_167_footnoteWe call it a state of suffering, and pray to our Maker, our reliance being entirely on Him. It is indeed a declaration of war on the part of General Smuts against British Indians.

52,,NATAL’S BRAVERY,"
    
 Whom shall we single out for praise now? The Indians’ star appears to be in the ascendant as they have been excelling one another. Natal has reached the apogee. The sight of Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and Mr. M. C. Anglia setting out for gaol, followed by young Indians, and of hundreds of persons going to the station to see them off, will strike terror in the heart of the enemy. How can anyone bear those ill-will, who come forward to act in this manner? Mr. Dawad Mahomed is an old man. He left his wife in the later stages of her pregnancy and went off in the service of the motherland. Mr. Parsee Rustomjee took only a few hours [to make up his mind] and then indicated his readiness to go to gaol. Mr. Anglia gave up his business to go to gaol. Which of them shall we praise? Which of them shall we congratulate on his courage? When all of them are brave, Indians are beginning to wonder if there is any need to compliment [any individual]. Let us hope things will always go on in this fashion.

53,"August 23, 1908",SPEECH AT MASS MEETINGlibtech_168_footnote,"
           [JOHANNESBURG, 
  August 23, 1908] Last Sunday [August 23], unfortunately, as the Chairman of the Association sorrow-fully remarked, found it necessary to hold another large Mass Meeting of protest. The members, if anything, exceeded those of the crowd that massed within  the 	Mosque grounds the week before. General Smuts had brought forward 	his new Bill, but as it did not repeal the Asiatic Act, and as it 	made no provision for the freedom and rights of highly educated 	Asiatics, it was not possible to accept the new measure. Hence 	Sunday’s Meeting. A dramatic note was struck when the Pathan 	leaders admitted their previous errorslibtech_169_footnoteand declared their 	intentions of joining the fight until the end. Amongst those present 	who gave encouragement to the people, were the Durban leaders, 	anxious only for the time when they should be summoned before the 	Court to pay the penalty of their patriotism ... It is only 	necessary to add that the meeting broke up when some 525 	more certificates had 	been consigned to the flames amidst loud cheers, Mr. S. Haloo and 	Mr. U.M. Shelat assuming the role of stokers....  MR. GANDHI’S SPEECHlibtech_170_footnote  [Gandhiji, 	who spoke 	after Mr. Essop 	Mia,  said:]  	I think that it is necessary for me to make a few remarks in 	connection with what has happened during the last few days in 	connection with the Asiatic community resident in the Transvaal. I 	have had to take the responsibility again, in spite of the 	Validation Bill having gone through both Houses practically 	unanimously, of advi- sing my country-men still to continue to burn 	their registration certifi- cates, and to show to the Government 	that they are as determined as ever to suffer until full redress is 	given with reference to the demands made by the British Indian 	community. Mr. Chairmanlibtech_171_footnotehas explained to you that we have made no new demand. 	We have never shifted the      Gandhiji’s 	advice to the Pathan community (vide 	“Johannesburg 	Letter”, 16-5-1908) had had effect. Gandhiji, however, recalls 	that it was in the meeting of August 16 that Mir Alam confessed to 	having done wrong in assaulting Gandhiji and gave up his certificate 	for being burnt. Vide 	satyagraha in South Africa Ch. 	XXVII.   
 ground, but we have been com-pelled, inch by inch, to regain the whole of the lost ground by undergoing sufferings heaped one upon another. It required the incarceration of over 200 Indians before we could gain the admission from General Smuts that his law was bad, that it was unworkable, and that it would be removed from the Statute-book. It again required the incarceration of nearly 100  Indians before we could gain what we have through the Validation Bill, and I have no hesitation in making this admission, that the Validation Bill, is a vast improvement on the old Asiatic Act, much of the irritating clauses have been removed, the great religious objection has been removed, our oath has been preserved, and, for this, all honour to the Government, all honour to the Progrcssive Party, and I am now in a position to tell my countrymen, that if they do not  choose to fight for a principle but if they have wished to demonstrate to the world that they were fighting only that they might be able to keep their solemn obligation but not that they might be able to keep their own status in the country, I can freely advise them to accept the Validation Act, but if it is their desire, as I hope it ever was their desire, that we have undertaken this battle not merely for our personal benefits, but in order to fight for a principle or a bundle of principles, then I have no hesitation in asking my countrymen to undergo further suffering, but, whether they do so or not in a body, whether the majority of the Asiatics choose to accept the benefits that the Government have so liberally given, as they put it, it is open to them to do so; but so long as I remain in this country, it is my desire to oppose the measures of the Government until we get the redress to which we are entitled, until the promise that I still declare General Smuts made in connection with the repeal of the Act is fulfilled, and until the status of highly educated Asiatics is placed on a firm footing. These are no new demands. The Colonists or the Government, by giving us a little, inch by inch, make the Colonists believe that they are conceding what they need not have conceded, but I deny that position absolutely. I take the position that the Chairman has taken, and it is only when these two things have been fulfilled that we shall have got what was our own or what should have been our own. I draw your attention to this fact, that General Smuts himself has told us now and told the world that the natives of South Africa, the Zulus and Bantus, get treated the same as the Europeans, if they possess  the  same educational qualifications as the Europeans, but the poor Indian and the poor Chinaman cannot do that. [Cries of “shame!”] If the natives
 of South Africa may not have the colour bar, why should the British Indian, why should the Chinaman, have the colour bar? Why should the Indian and Chinaman be subjected to the colour bar, have to labour under this colour disability? It is quite enough that we consent to the influx from British India being stopped entirely; but  the stopping of that influx does not mean—it never meant—that educated Indians were to be shut out of this country or that they could enter it only on a permit granted by the Governor-in-Council and  which  might be revoked at pleasure. That is not the position for which we have been fighting so long, and that is not a position which can ever be accepted by us if we wish to be called men. When we take up this position, it is not a position of defiance; and I am very sorry indeed that Sir Percy has thought it desirable to hint, although very distantly, that there might be in this Colony a racial conflict. A racial conflict is now going on. I do not know what the meaning of any further racial conflict may be, but I do know this, that if it covers any threat of physical violence, I standing here before this multitude of my countrymen shall ask you to suffer even that physical injury. I see before me today my fellow-countrymen, the Tamil gentlemen. Their sore backs I have seen. They have never been used to carry[ing] sandbags, but they were called upon to carry sandbags in the gaol [“Shame !” and groans.]—these were the Gaol Regulations, but they have suffered, all the same, physical injury under the  Gaol Regulations. It has not pleased General Smuts in fighting this battle with a weak people, with a people who have no voice, it has not pleased General Smuts to order the gaol authorities to give no hard labour to these prisoners or to give them hard labour which they could bear; but, no, we have to drink the cup of difficulty up to the brim, and I ask my countrymen to drink that cup if they wish to fight for a principle. I do declare that our fight, my fight, has always been for a principle, and it shall be for a principle. General Smuts has been saying that we claim partnership.libtech_172_footnotelibtech_173_footnoteWe do claim partnership I claim it now, but I claim it as a younger brother. Their Christianity teaches them that every human being is a brother. The British Constitution teaches us, it taught me when yet a child, that every British subject was to be treated on a footing of equality in the eye of the law, and I do demand that equality in the eye of the law in the Transvaal also. So
 
 may be allowed to remain in this Colony, so long must I continue that agitation until British Indians have equality in the eye of the law; it is purely and simply a question of time, but that equality must be given. It may not be given, then we may be driven out of the country and I should be quite content. If that is the position that the British Government have taken up, if that is the position that the Transvaal Government also have taken up, I am quite willing to take up the position that Parliament has taken up, namely, that the white Colonists, that Parliament should occupy the fiduciary position, because we are vassals, because we have no representation in Parliament. I accept that position. What is the duty of a trustee, if not to make his ward fit for everything that the trustee has been doing for the ward? Are the Government fitting us, their wards, for full citizenship? Do they hold out any such hope at all? And if they do why is there so much resentment, why should there be sustained cheering in the House of Parliament when General Smuts derides the idea of partnership? Yes, partnership undoubtedly. British Indians will not remain in this country or in any country under the British flag as slaves. They will demand to remain in this country, as also in any part of the British Dominions, as men, and so long as we do not claim this, I think that we do not deserve British citizenship, and, seeing that it is my intense prayer to the Almighty that my countrymen live as full British citizens, so long must we continue to work that we may have given to us these rights. (Applause.)libtech_174_footnote
 General Smuts had called what was really a private letter “an ultimatum”. (Iaughter.) It was nonsense; there was no such intention. He [Gandhiji] asked the Government and the Colonists to trust them [the Indians]; to believe that “we shall play the game”, and to recognize the very just demands of the Indian community with reference to the repeal of the Act and the status of the highly educated Indians should be preserved. Let them not be called upon to wear the bar sinister. He believed that Sorabji was entitled to remain in the country under the Immigration Restriction Act, for the point was still unchallenged. Those who remained in this country and those who would come after must be treated as men and not as dogs.

THE COLONIAL SECRETARY
 PRETORIA SIR,
I have the honour to enclose herewith a report of the
 proceedings that took place yesterday, and the Resolutions passed at the Mass Meetinglibtech_176_footnote. The Meeting was attended by over 3,000 Indians. The feeling of those who were present at the Meeting, so far as I have been able to gauge it, is unmistakable.
 I venture to submit that, in the very humble prayer of the Meeting, there is nothing new. What the Meeting requests is, moreover, reasonable, and, on the eve of what promises to be a fierce struggle, I once more ask for the relief sought by the Meeting. I beg to assure the Government that there is no desire, on the part of the Indian community, to wilfully embarrass the Government or to place ourselves outside the laws of the country.
 My Association, therefore, respectfully trusts that Colonial statesmanship will still find a way out of the difficulty, and close the struggle that has now gone on for nearly two years, and has cost the community represented by my Association very heavily in every respect.

          THE 	EDITOR       [JOHANNESBURG,]  August 	25, 1908 
 [RAND 	DAILY MAIL]  SIR,  	It is wonderful how every demand made by British Indians is being 	misunderstood. When my countrymen recognize that the Billlibtech_178_footnotejust passed by the local Parliament is better than the 	Asiatic Act, they do not admit that their position of serfs is 	removed. The very fact that the status of educated Indians hangs 	fire shows that there is no desire to treat them otherwise. Was not 	my claim to partnership resented? Was not its repudiation by General 	Smuts received with sustained cheers in the popular House? And, yet, 	what is strange in the claim put forward by me? You, Sir, know well 	that we are taught in the public schools in India the doctrine of 	partnership and equality in the eye of the law, and yet, these are 	expressions one may not even whisper in the Colony without being 	laughed out of court.  	You have drawn a parallel between Mr. Sauer’s remarks on the 	Dealers’ Act at the Cape and a general education test in an 	immigra- tion Act, which would have the effect of preventing an 	unrestricted influx of Asiatics into a British Colony. May I remind 	you that Mr. Sauer has dealt with a farcical Court of Appeal 	consisting of prejudiced persons? I, too, should agree with the 	hon’ble Member, and even go further than he has done, when 	fellow-traders are appointed a Court of Appeal for the question of a 	licence being granted to one of themselves. It is not only 	hypocrisylibtech_179_footnotelibtech_180_footnoteand humbuglibtech_181_footnotebut downright injustice. I, however, see nothing wrong 	in an Immigration Act which provides against an indiscriminate entry 	of a class of people, the distinction being based not on their race 	or colour but on an educational qualification. If what my countrymen 	claim is a quibble, surely the Parliament of the Colony should have 	sufficient magnanimity to concede a quibble. The fact is that it is 	not a quibble. The Colony wishes to establish a new principle and to 	draw a sharp colour line. It wishes to override the late Mr. Rhodes’ 	formula of equal rights for all civilized men south of the Zambesi, 	and it wishes       
 also to fundamentally change the British policy. We would be less than men if, after having suffered for nearly two years, we were to quietly accept such a violent departure from British traditions, without making a supreme effort and without showing to the world that, although our own status can be made a little more bearable under the new Bill, we would reject the benefits thereunder, if we cannot successfully oppose the new departure.
 You seem to think that Mr. Sorabjee’s deportation is the last word on the interpretation of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act. The future will show whether it is so. In the meanwhile, may I remind you that Mr. Sorabjee was convicted not under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act as a “prohibited immigrant” but under the Asiatic Act for being an unregistered Indian. He entered under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act, but he came under the disability imposed on him by the Asiatic Act, which Mr. Sorabjee would not accept.libtech_182_footnote

Amendment Act No. 2 of 1907 for failing to produce a registration certificate issued
 under the Act on demand. Mr. Gandhi defended. Superintendent Vernon, who gave evidence as to the arrest, stated that he had arrested the accused on instructions. He knew that there were many Indians today in Johannesburg who had permits and old registration certificates, but he was not instructed to take action against them. The accused, giving evidence on his own behalf, stated that he was an old resident of the Transvaal and that he had a Peace Preservation Ordinance Permit and a registration certificate under Law 3 of 1885, both of which documents were produced before the Court.
 Addressing the Court, Mr. Gandhi remarked upon the strangeness of the proceedings. Here was a man arrested and convicted under the Asiatic Act, whose rights were fully safeguarded under the Actlibtech_187_footnotethat had just been passed. Either the Government intended to stick to their new measure or they did not. In view of the delicate relations that existed at the present time he had specially asked that this case should be remanded until next Monday, but whilst the Prosecution was willing to meet him in this, instructions had been received by the latter from Pretoria to proceed.

 Wednesday [August 26, 1908]
 WHAT HAVE WE GAINED THROUGH NEW BILL?
 Again, this time, I will have to discuss the latest news first. The new Bill was passed by both the Houses within 24 hours. This only shows that they still do not give our feelings due consideration.
 The Bill contains almost everything [we wanted]. I have no time for a detailed explanation. But the Bill obviates the objections regarding the Turkish Muslims. Voluntary registrants will not come within the scope of the Act as also others who may [voluntarily] register themselves in future. This will enable the community to keep its pledge inviolate. But there are two things which the Bill does not contain. The obnoxious law will be repealed in effect; but it will remain as a dead letter. The Indian community has every right to oppose this [proposal]. Mr. Smuts made a promise [to repeal it]. But, what is more important, [the rights of] the educated have not been safeguarded. I am afraid that there is going to be a long-drawn-out struggle over this issue. It is the duty of the Indian community to put up a fight.
 WHO SHOULD BE TREATED AS EDUCATED?
 This question is often discussed. What the Indian community wants is that all educated persons should have equal rights under the law. But though rights may remain equal in theory, Indians may in practice be subjected to a more severe test than the whites. This is what happens in Natal and the Cape. The test for Indians [in these Colonies] is very severe. We have said that we shall not object to an even severer test in the Transvaal. In consequence, only barristers and others of equal [attainments] will be able to enter the Transvaal. I do not see that we can do anything more. What is important is that the educated should not be kept out altogether. As for those with a lower standard of education who may want to come in for business or professional reasons, the section which allows them to come in with a temporary permit remains. In fact, there is no real difficulty about these persons.
 SNAG
 There is, however, a snag in this Bill. Those who enter the Trans- vaal henceforth must, if they do not have a permit, prove that they had resided in the Colony for at least three years before the [Boer] War.
 This section will also apply to those who are already in the Transvaal.  I feel it may be possible to find a way out of this. [That is,] if there is a settlement, a solution does appear possible.
 RESIDENTS OF NATAL
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, Mr. M. C. Anglia and Mr. Randeria have been on a round of visits to Krugersdorp, Potche-fstroom and Klerksdorp. They were received with honours at all the towns, and people readily handed over their registers to them [for being burnt]. They were first given a party by Mr. Essop Mia and later another by Mr. Fancylibtech_189_footnote. They are putting up   with  Mr.  Cama. These worthy gentlemen have put the Indian community under a deepdebt of obligation.
 At Volksrust and Charles town, Mr. Essop Suleman and Mr. Mullan are shouldering the burden of the community’s affairs. They have a large number of Indians staying with them, but undeterred by this, they continue to help. All this augurs well for India.
Mr. Shelat has collected certificates from Pretoria. Here, Mr.
Joshi, Mr. Medh and Mr. Killawala go round [collecting them].
 BHIKHUBHAI MALIHA
 Mr.   Bhikhubhai   Dayalji   Maliha’s   case   was   heard   today.libtech_190_footnoteThough he held a permit, he has been given seven days’ notice [to leave the Colony] for not submitting to the new law. This case conclusively shows that the obnoxious Act must be repealed.
 OTHER NEWS
 Mr. Ibrahim and Mr. Hassan Mia, both butchers, went to gaol on Tuesday to serve a sentence of eight days’ imprisonment for trading without a licence.
 Mr. Ahmed Motara, who has been thrice  imprisoned  for offering satyagraha, was released today (Wednesday). His courage deserves to be followed by everyone.
In Pietersburg, Mr. Taiyab Moosa Memon has gone to gaol.
 In Pretoria, a large number of Indians have gone to gaol. I hope to be able to mention their names later. They all deserve to be con gratulated. A telegram says that one of them was manhandled by the police in Court. The matter is being inquired into. Even if one has to
 
 suffer violence to one’s person, that must be borne for the sake of one’s country.
 Mr. Nadirsha Cama is likely to lose his job for having spoken at the last meeting. But this does not bother him. He had made up his I mind to fight for the community. I
 Mr. Sorabji Shapurji Adajania has been wanting to enter the Transvaal again. It is only because the Association has restrained him that he has not done so already.
 An unsatisfactory reply has been received from the Government about food [in gaol]. The matter is being pursued further.
 I must tell the large number of persons who are impatient to come in that, for the present, only those who hold genuine permits may do so. Others may not come. They should not become restive about this.
 The Chinese Association had asked the Durban gentlemen over yesterday (Tuesday). They have a very fine club of their own. The Indians are without one. Altogether there are probably only a thousand Chinese [in the Transvaal]. We are here in our thousands. It is humiliating that even so we do not have a comparable club of our own.
 In England, Mr. Ritch has been  taking  great  painslibtech_191_footnote.  A  large meeting of Indians has been called in London to protest against the deportation of Sorabji.

 [JOHANNESBURG,]
 August 28, 1908
 THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS PRETORIA
SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the diet scale laid down for British Indian prisoners in the Transvaal Gaols.
 My Association begs to point out that a change in the diet scale has been asked for not because the food supplied is medically improper but because it is not suited to the habits of British Indian prisoners. My Association, therefore, ventures to submit that it  is  hardly a question for medical opinion, but it is one for investigating the habits of British Indians as to food.
 My Association admits that mealie meal forms part of the diet scale for Indian prisoners in the Natal gaols, but my Association does not agree with the inference drawn therefrom that mealie meal is suitable for Indian prisoners. Happily, throughout South Africa, very few Indians are incarcerated and, therefore, the question of the diet scale has not hitherto occupied the attention of Indian public bodies, but now, in view of the unusual position that has been created in the Transvaal, the question has become one of very great importance, and, unless the authorities intend to disregard Indian habits and sentiments entirely, my Association submits that an investigation in the manner suggested by me is absolutely necessary.
 I venture also to point out to you that you have omitted to mention that the Natal scale, whilst it retains mealie meal as part of the
 diet for British Indians, provides for bread also, thus enabling Indians at least to fall back upon four ounces of bread. I beg also to point out that, according to the Natal scale, for prisoners undergoing a sentence beyond 42 days, treacle is added to the ration of mealie meal, and that for others the scale is fairly liberal, much more so than the Transvaal scale. My Association, therefore, respectfully trusts that the matter will be reconsidered.
 I have the honour to be, Sir,
 Your obedient servant, ESSOP ISMAIL MIA CHAIRMAN,

61,"August 29, 1908",COMMENTS ON TRANSVAAL INDIAN CAMPAIGN,"
    
 [August 29, 1908]libtech_194_footnote
 “THE TRANSVAAL LEADER”
 Under an article entitled “Mistakes”, the Leader points out that, perhaps due to heavy pressure of work, the Colonial Secretary is unaware of how the law is being administered in relation to  the Asiatics. An Indian, who could not register  voluntarily,  as  he happened to be away in a remote district, was arrested last Wednesday. He had not taken any part in the campaign. He was arrested even though protection for such Indians is ensured in the new Bill. It is thus clear that the obnoxious Act lives on. It is easy to see that such incidents make it difficult for us to explain to the innocent and illiterate people that the old law has really become a dead letter and that the repeal of the Act is therefore unnecessary. This is a grave error. The place (Anjuman Islam) where some leading Muslims were arrested yesterday is sacred to Muslims. They had not the least intention of evading arrest. The incidents in Turkey have angered the majority of Muslims. They form a considerable part of the population of the British Empire. Tilak and many others like him may exploit these incidents to embarrass the British administration and unite
 
 Hindus and Muslims into an “Extremist Party”.
 “PRETORIA NEWS”
 In its editorial of the 25th instant, Pretoria News writes that, as it had earlier called upon General Smuts to carry out the terms of the compromise, so does it now urge that the Asiatics who have not registered should do so. The Government has fulfilled its promise and it is now for the Asiatics also to fulfil theirs. It will not  be  unreasonable [to insist] that the immigration issue should be taken up for consideration after this has been done.
 In another article following this, under the heading “Immigration”, the paper says that Asiatics are shabbily treated and that it fully sympathizes with them. According to existing laws, low-class Russians or Poles or other [Europeans] who speak Greek or have a smattering of one of the Levantine languages can enter the country at will and enjoy full citizenship rights. For this purpose, Yiddish and European languages are treated on par, though Yiddish is not a European language. Justice demands that there should be an equally difficult qualifying test for all those who enter the Colony. The officials of the Immigration Department should be armed with wide powers, and they should be persons of intelligence and integrity. They should be paid good salaries so that they are not tempted into taking bribes. They should have a clear idea as to [the category of persons] who may not enter the colony. In short, we suggest that the door which is now closed on the Asiatics should be closed lawfully. This country cannot accommodate any more Asiatics. We  wholly agree with this. But we go further and assert that some of the  Europeans who are entering the country [unlawfully] may prove more dangerous than Asiatics. The Asiatics’ standard of living is very low and they are [thus] able to compete to their advantage  [with Europeans] in trade. But they do not add to the crime in the country, whereas the Europeans roam the country for their bread. Latterly, their number has increased markedly. Their coming in has added to the incidence of theft and the smuggling of gold and diamonds, has encouraged [the growth of ] liquor shops. [Because of them,] panders and money-lenders flourish and other similar crimes are on the increase. We have decisively closed the door on the Asiatics but it should be closed also to this refuse [from Europe]. By doing so we will make it clear that in the matter of entry into this country, we do not discriminate against the black and the yellow traces] because of their colour. Those who want to make this country truly “European” will agree that our Natives and law-abiding Asiatics are preferable to this garbage [from Europe]. We want peasants who will raise crops,
 diligent workers who will man the industries and thereby add to the Colony’s prosperity. There are already too many traders and speculators in this Colony.
 REPLY
 Mr. Gandhi has addressed a long letterlibtech_195_footnoteto the editor of  Pretoria News in reply to the above, arguing that the Government cannot be held to have fulfilled its promise. It is true that the new Bill grants some measure of relief, and the obnoxious Act is reduced to a dead letter. But the Government has not allowed his [Indian] brethren to derive any satisfaction from this. Prosecutions have been going on under the obnoxious Act. It was promised that the Act would be repealed, and the promise must be carried out. On the issue of immigration also, he [Mr. Gandhi] said that educated Asiatics should have equal rights with others.

62,"August 30, 1908",SPEECH AT MEETING IN HAMIDIA MOSQUE,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 August 30, 1908]
 Mr. Gandhi addressed a meeting of Indians at the Mosque, Fordsburg, yesterday afternoon, when he made special reference to the deportation of the Natal leaders. The audience expressed whole-hearted approval of the plan of campaign and the announcement that the deported leaders would cross the borders on their return journey probably that night was received with great enthusiasm. Mr. Gandhi also announced that five more Natal Indians would be arrested at nine o’clock this  morning, and would be deported.

 HOW TO WAGE CAMPAIGN?
 Things will become clearer to the reader if we answer this question before reporting the news. Considering all the circumstances, we feel that the coming struggle may be a bitter and extended one. The Government will adopt sterner measures. It does not appear probable that the Indians will make a concerted effort. We have not received an adequate number of certificates for being burnt. All told, 2,300 certificates have been burnt. The number is not insignificant. But it is too small if we look forward to an early end of the movement.
 We also learn that people have been visiting the Registration Office to apply for certificates. In Johannesburg 25 Indians went there on Friday last. The Government will now be justified in concluding that a large number of Indians will submit to the Act.
 There can be no question now of obeying the obnoxious Actlibtech_197_footnotelibtech_198_footnote, but the success of this last phase of the struggle depends on our refusal to submit to the new lawlibtech_199_footnotelibtech_200_footnote. The new Bill has not yet become law. It has not yet received Royal assent. But it is necessary to disobey it even if it receives it.
 We may assume that those who have not handed over their registers to be burnt will not join the movement, so that it is only on the 2,300 Indians that it must depend. We may take it that some of these will back out. We can also assume that those who have not got their certificates will join the movement. We can therefore assume that 2,000 Indians will continue to fight. The Tamil-speaking people alone make up a fourth of this number. They have been most commendable. We need not be depressed by these figures. In fact, 2,000 Indians can achieve momentous results. But I cannot believe that all the two thousand of them will turn out to be true fighters. Burning a certificate really means that the Indian who throws it into the flames does not care to keep it. He is willing to forgo the benefits
 
Appendix I.
 which a certificate confers. He will not produce his licence or take out one. He will not respect the Govern-ment’s law in any way and will, on the contrary, do his best to get him-self imprisoned.
 Now, I know that these 2.000 Indians are not all such brave men. Some of them have already taken out licences, which they have been us-ing. They produce them whenever demanded by an official. I think these men might as well not have burnt their certificates. I consider it necessary therefore further to reduce the 2,000 by a thousand. Let us now consider what the remaining thousand can do. The answer is that they can frighten the Government into doing justice. Their campaign will ensure the repeal of the obnoxious Act. The doors will remain open for the well-educated. The rights of those who are already in the Transvaal but possess no certificates will be preserved, provided their claims are genuine. But will the  one thousand hold out till the last even after the others have yielded ? I believe they will. Those who fight to the bitter end are always a few in number. They are not influenced by what others do. They fight on, stak-ing their all, without taking thought as to what others do, because they believe their cause to be just and therefore think it their duty to fight.
 These thousand persons will have to be prepared for much suffering indeed. What does it matter if there is loss of money, if people are imprisoned or deported, or even if they are assaulted ? They may lose everything, but not their honour. They may  be  forsaken by everyone, but will not be forsaken by God.
 The annoying practice of auctioning the goods of those who refuse to pay the fine is becoming common. It was adopted in Pretoria, in Hei-delberg, and also in Vereeniging. If all  the  storekeepers did without licences, there would have been no difficulty, no need for concern about the auctioning of goods. But Indians have not yet developed the strength to face losses as isolated individuals. Admittedly this strength cannot be acq-uired all at once.  Many Indians hold licences for the whole year. We have therefore only to consider a few cases. The best course for these persons is to sell their shops nominally—but through a proper legal transac-tion—to whites and carry on trade in the name of these whites. Mr. Gab-riel Isaac is prepared for this.libtech_201_footnotelibtech_202_footnotelibtech_203_footnoteThe auctioning of goods can be prevented in this manner. It may be argued that there will then be hardly any fight-ing left to be done by Indian traders. They will escape the privations and it will be the poor hawkers who will be ruined. In order to forestall this
 
 charge, those storekeepers who trade in the name of whites should go out hawking and thus court imprisonment. Those who hold licences in their own names should prepare a servant or a relative to go to gaol. It is only right that the storekeepers should do this. But it would, however, be improper for hawkers to argue in this fashion. For it should not be supposed that a person who goes to gaol is like one dead. On the con-trary he is very much alive. He should think himself fortunate that he is in gaol. Indeed, one who cannot go to gaol is an unfortunate person. Moreover, a storekeeper can help the movement through contributions. Our object is to tire out the Government. This is to be achieved by going to gaol, which can be done in two ways. The first is for the hawkers to get arrested by going on their rounds without a licence. Since there can be no question of a hawker’s goods being auctioned, he will only be fined. The second is to court arrest and imprisonment by refusing to give thumb-impressions or finger- prints or signatures at the border. No one should go about with a lot of money in his pocket. One should not even carry jewellery on one’s person. They [the authorities] have started prosecutions against those who refuse to give thumb-impressions. It is easy therefore to get arrested. Only those who hold genuine permits may, however, enter the Transvaal now. Holders of Dutch passes, etc., must not come in for the present. Educated persons may not come in either—not just yet.
 If we carry on the fight in this manner, the climax may be reached in October. The end may come even earlier if we pull with all our strength. If not, it may come in October. By then, the hawking licences of many Indians will have expired. We may expect that a large number of Indians will refuse to apply for the renewal of their licences. The Government will then have no option but to arrest them. Those persons whose certificates have been burnt will not get licences at all. I hope that these Indians accordingly will choose to go without licences.
 NATAL BUSINESSMEN
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and Mr. Anglia have been extremely active. They were not arrested in Johannesburg on Thursdaylibtech_204_footnotethe 26th [August], so they proceeded to Pretoria by the 12 o’clock train after sending a wire. They were accompanied by Mr. Randeria. They were in the Anjuman-e-Islam Hall discussing arrange- ments for collecting certificates when Superintendent Betts served a
 
 warrant on them and arrested all the four.libtech_205_footnoteThey were refused bail. News was received later that a warrant had been issue for their deportation. Mr. Gandhi went to Pretoria by the last train. Through Advocate Blake the police were served with a notice to the effect that the Government had no authority thus to issue a warrant for their deportation.libtech_206_footnoteThe intention in serving this notice was not to take the case to the supreme Court, but only to expose the high-handedness of the Government. The notice, by the morning however, appeared to have had not effect. The men were taken to Natal train. Nothing was kept secret. Anyone who wished to see them was allowed to do so. Many Indians were present at the station to see them off.
 A meeting was held in the Anjuman-e-Islam Hall at midnight when the question of collecting the certificates was discussed. Mr. Hajee Cassim said that whether or not the Memons were willing to hand over their certificates would be announced on Sunday after due consideration. The others resolved to hand them over immediately.
 MASS MEETING
 A mass meeting was held in Pretoria on Friday. Mr. Bagas was in the chair. The meeting was very well attended and great enthusiasm was evinced. Though a large number of certificates were burnt, I must say that the number received was not so large as it should have been. In Pretoria, only 60 certificates were received—this number  is exclusive of those from the Madrasis—and this is not nearly enough. A report of the meeting will appear elsewhere and so I do not give it here.
 MEETING OF MADRASIS
 A separate meeting of Tamil Indians was held on Sunday, to which Mr. Gandhi was invited. Madrasis have surpassed all expectations. We find that nearly a fourth of them have been to gaol. They were extremely enthusiastic and declared that, whatever the others did, they would carry on the fight. They also resolved to collect funds.
 TWO KONKANIS RELEASED
 Both the Konkani butchers who were gaoled last week have been released. From their reports it would appear that the gaol warders do not harass prisoners any longer. They say Mulji Patel and Harilal
 
 Gandhilibtech_207_footnotelibtech_208_footnoteare in good health.
 ZAVER RANDERI
 Mr. Zaver Randeri Soni, who, though his temporary permit has expired, did not leave the Transvaal, has been awarded a month’s imprisonment. He deposed that he had Intended on the expiry of his term to leave the Colony and re-enter afterwards as an educated  person, but that, meanwhile, he had been arrested. “This is my good fortune,” Mr. Randeri said is his evidence.
 DEPORTATION OF TWELVE MEN
 Mr. Shelat, Mr. Joshi, Mr. Killawala, Mr. Medh, Mr. Ibrahim Hussein and others have been arrested and ordered to be deported. All of them will re-enter. They do not get any food [in gaol] from members of the community or friends. they themselves asked to be given gaol food. They get bread, potatoes, etc. They will be taken to Volksrust tonight.
 EBRAHIM OSMAN
 People here are glad that Mr. Ebrahim Osman has gone to gaol. He can be regarded as one of the leaders of the Memon community. His courageous act does that community great credit. He had plainly refused to give his thumb-impression on the train as also at the Charge Office. The policeman admitted while giving evidence that he knew Ebrahim. Mr. Polak gave evidence that it was through him that Ebrahim had obtained a permit. Ebrahim’s identity therefore was not in question. The only offence was his refusal to give his thumb- impression. This is no ordinary tyranny. But I hope that, in view of cases like these, no Indian will give his thumb-impression till a settlement is reached.
 NADIRSHA CAMA
 Mr. Nadirsha Cama has been dismissed by the Government. On reflection, we shall see that this is no common occurrence. Mr. Cama felt so strongly on the subject that he attended the last mass meeting. The Government then asked him for an explanation. Since it was a fact that Mr. Cama had taken part in the proceedings, he  was dismissed. And he has welcomed his dismissal. He acted as he did mainly for the sake of the campaign for the rights of the educated. Mr. Cama having been sacrificed in this manner, the educated should
 
 feel inspired tenfold. The community as a whole has been a party to Mr. Cama’s dismissal, and it cannot therefore back out. Let me congratulate Mr. Cama. He sets little store by the pittance he was earning by slaving for the Government. This is an example worthy of emulation.
 MESSAGE FROM NATAL
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed and his companions, on reaching Charlestown after their deportation, sent the following telegram to various towns:
 Spent last night in prisoners’ cell Pretoria with full trust in God. Sooner or later we shall be in gaol-palace in Transvaal thus doing our duty to motherland in some measure.libtech_209_footnoteHope every Indian will do his duty at all costs. We send this message to our brethren before we go to gaol.
We hope every Indian will remember this advice.
 MEMORABLE TELEGRAM
 When Mr. Dawad Mahomed and other Natal leaders reached Volksrust, Mr. Osman Ahmed sent them the following telegram:libtech_210_footnote
 Congratulate you all. Trust in God. Pray to Him. Obey Him who saved Noah from deluge, Moosa from Pharaohs, Abraham from fire, Joseph from the well, Ayoob from sickness, Enoos inside a whale, and our Prophet when he was in the cave. He is with us and He is ever just.
 This is a very inspiring telegram. I urge Mr. Osman Ahmed himself to have the same heroic courage which he wants the businessmen to be infused with. Examples similar to the above will be found in all the scriptures. This is an age in which we treat  the teachings of the scriptures as mere platitudes which do not have to be acted upon. We only pay lip service to such examples. We feel God to be so far away from us that we hardly allow these teachings to influence our conduct. This is an occasion for Indians to act rather than talk. If all the Indians were to fight with sincere faith in God, freedom would be won within 24 hours.
 PRISONERS  ON FRONT
 I have not so far been able to give the names of the Madrasis who went to gaol on August 14 for the sake of their country. I give them below:
 
 Messrs Kangasami Pillay, Saveri Pillay, R. Packrey Moodaley, Rajoo Naidoo, Subrayaloo Naidoo, S. Pavaday Naidoo, Muthram- oothoo Pather, M. Nadason, Candasami, Moonsami Naidoo, V. Vurthen, S. Rangasami Naidoo, Venkatsami Appoodoo, Ranga Padiachy, R. Jameson, S. Vallu Padiachy, S. Moothramoothoo Pillay,
V. Govindsami Padiachy, C. Canda Moodaley, Narasoomulloo, Ranga Padiachy, Nayana Naidoo, Rama, Nagappan Naidoo.
 Most of these persons held licences, yet they went out hawking without using them.
 Some of them were treated cruelly by the gaolers, who worked them so hard that they had inflammation on their backs. Regardless of this, they are ready to go to gaol again. Six affidavits in this  connection have been forwarded to the Chief Gaoler. Probably the gaolers will not behave in the same way again. Even if they do, what does it matter ? The more we suffer, the earlier we shall be free.
 IN CHRISTIANA
 Mr. Ismail Essop Belim was sentenced to a fine of £15 for trading without a licence or, in default of payment, to a month’s imprisonment. Mr. Belim chose to go to gaol. As if this was not enough, they have now arrested Mr. Ibrahim Adamji Limda, his servant. It does not appear likely that he will be convicted, for it has been ruled by the Court that a servant cannot be prosecuted on a charge of trading without a licence.
 M. PATEL 
 His goods were auctioned in Vereeniging. He was fined £1.7.6, to recover which they sold goods worth £20, and awarded £6.5.6 to the messengerlibtech_211_footnoteas his expenses. Here is an instance of a crone not worth a pice whose head it costs two pice to shave.libtech_212_footnoteI congratulate Mr. Patel. We shall be free only when people everywhere accept such losses. Who can now assert that General Smuts is not the leader of a band of robbers ?libtech_213_footnote
 Tuesday [September 1, 1908]
 
 
 ELEVEN MORE FROM NATAL
 Further reports have been received about the gentlemen from Natal. Those eleven persons who were to set out last night were taken away by Mr. Vernon. They were seen off at the Park Station by a few persons. Others went to Jeppe. These persons would not accept any food from outside. They only took gaol food. All of them had left Charlestown early in the morning and walked to the Charge Office at Volksrust, where they were arrested. Traders and educated persons have now joined hands again. All of them have resolved to stay on in gaol. Even in the matter of food, they eat what is given to them in gaol. My advice is that they should ask for the gaol uniform also. It has not yet been decided when they will be tried. The Government has yet to consider what they should be charged with. True fighters will not offer bail money, will not ask for food from outside and will submit to any harassment by the Government. I would also advise my brethren not to ask for anything to be brought to them surreptitiously. If they are addicted to smoking, they must give up the habit. Freedom from such addiction will benefit the body as well as the mind. Even if we do not take that into account, it is only proper to give up these addictions for the sake of one’s country.
 MEETING OF HAMIDIA ISLAMIC SOCIETY
 His Majesty the Sultan [of Turkey] completed 32 years of his reign on August 31,  and  on  the  same  day  the  Al  Madinalibtech_214_footnotelibtech_215_footnoteHejaz Railway was inaugurated. The [Hamidia] Islamic Society held a mass meeting to celebrate the event. A large number of Muslims were present. Invitations had been sent out to some whites. Among those present were Mr. Wolfgang, the Turkish Consul, and his friend, Mr. P.
 Crown. 	who has served 	in Turkey 	and was awarded 	the Order 	of Turkey, 	Class II. Mr. Kallenbach 	and Mr. Isaac 	were also present. 	Among the 	others present were 	Mr. Godfrey, Mr. 	Vyas, Mr. 	Cama, Mr. 	Naidoo and 	Mr. Gandhi. 
 The proceedings were conducted with the utmost efficiency amidst great enthusiasm. Six resolutions were passed. A fund for the Hejaz Railway was started on the spot. Mr. Hajee Habib put his name down for £10. The barbers collected more than £9 from amongst themselves. Mr. Nawab Khan paid one pound on the spot, and a cabman paid, amid applause, his earnings for the day—five shillings. Telegrams were received from many towns. Everywhere Muslim shops were closed [for the day]. Among these telegrams Mr. Nagadi’s deserves mention. It reported that sweets and gifts were distributed
 
 among white and Zulu children. This was an excellent idea; it shows the nobility of the Indian people, rather, of all Eastern peoples. The action of Warmbaths Indians in distributing sweets to white children, though the whites always behave like enemies, is noteworthy  and ought to be emulated. In this town, Osman Ahmed led a procession. There were children’s sports at which prizes were awarded. In the evening, there were fireworks. Everyone felt that the Hamidia Society’s hall was rather small. I hope the Muslims will add more storeys and build a hall so big and fine that it will be both pleasing and useful.
 Wednesday [September 2, 1908]
 GOD’S WILL BE DONE
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed and other gentlemen were deported but, as ordained, they have re-entered. Further, Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and Mr. Anglia have reached Johannesburg and started work again. Other friends are enjoying the fine air of the Volksrust gaol, which only means that they need not come to Johannesburg. They were all to be tried on Tuesday. But the Government itself fixed Tuesday next, the 7th, for their trial. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the three businessmen have come down to Johannesburg. Everyone is doing his duty. The businessmen’s presence is needed in Johannesburg. Others are doing their duty by staying in gaol.
 WHAT ABOUT SORABJI ?
 It is being asked why Sorabji, who was due to return, has not yet done so. I must point out that he himself is anxious to re-enter. But his duty consists in staying on in Charlestown for the present. This way he renders greater service. It is the Association which has restrained him. There has been no reply from the Government to the Association’s resolution about him. This is one reason, among others, why he is not being called back. He will also enter when his time comes. Everyone cannot have the same duty to perform. Everyone[, however,] must attend to his or her duty. Sorabji’s duty consists in restraining his enthusiasm and waiting.
 MOOSA ESSOP ADIA
 Mr. Moosa Essop Adia was fined £1 in Pretoria; While attaching his goods, the messenger also closed down his store. This is illegal. He had no authority to do this. The Association has therefore advised Mr. Adia to reopen the store and serve a notice on the messenger.
 DILDAR KHAN
 Mr. Dildar Khan who was employed as a servant by a white has been dismissed for taking part in the movement against the law. Yesterday, moreover, he had asked for leave to attend the  Hejaz Railway [celebrations]. I congratulate Mr. Dildar Khan on  his courage.
 COLLECTIONS
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Rustomjee and Mr. Anglia have been active from the moment they arrived. They went round soliciting contri-butions. I hope to give next week the names of those who have promised to pay.

 "
64,,IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT’S VIEWS,"
    
 Among the speeches in the Imperial Parliament reported in our English section, the one by Colonel Seely, Deputy Secretary of State for the Colonies, is particularly worth reading. He says that negotia- tions are in progress with the Transvaal Government. The speech also indicates that those who have a right to be in the Colonies should be accorded equal rights with the whites, and must be accepted as full- fledged citizens. We can argue from this that, in the interests of those already in the Colony, educated Indians must be allowed to enter. We can also see from Colonel Seely’s speech that, if we exert ourselves enough, the Imperial Government may help us. The key [to the situation] is with us. Satyagraha is all that is required of us.

65,,RITCH’S CONDITION,"
    
 We continue to receive letters from Mr. Ritchlibtech_216_footnotewhich make us very sad. There is much else the community does, but nothing to show its appreciation [of Ritch’s work]. Few whites or Indians can do what Mr. Ritch has been doing. He does not care for the salary, It is a
 
 
 shame to keep such a person always in want.
 There was a proposal earlier to send £300 to Mr. Ritch, of which only £100 have so far been sent. Now, even the money for his household expenses is not being remitted, let alone the balance of
 £200. What is more, it is becoming difficult for him even to meet the office expenses. In postponing things, as we are inclined to do , we are not being thoughtful about the difficulties of others. It is impossible for the Committee to continue its work under these conditions. It is therefore the duty of every Indian to do the most he can. Those who imagine that a great struggle like ours can be carried on without money are mistaken. We hope the community will make the necessary provision for Mr. Ritch. Else the Committee will collapse before long and we shall have reason to regret our helplessness afterwards.

 Yesterday was the birthday of the Grand Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji. He has entered on his eighty-fourth year. In India, his birthday is an occasion of public celebrations all over the country Enthusiastic meetings are held by the public bodies in the country and messages are sent wishing him a long life. The messages sent to him by associations in South Africa have been given elsewhere in this issue. They have done their duty in sending these. We wish him a long life and pray to our Maker to grant us, and others associated with this journal, hearts as pure as his. We urge our readers to emulate the spirit of patriotism of this Dadalibtech_220_footnotelibtech_221_footnote—he is indeed a veritable grandfather— which is the right way of cherishing his name. The Transvaal Indians must see to it that they honour their pledge as the immortal Dadabhai has honoured his for our sake. Our present campaign in South Africa is such that it would not be enough even if hundreds of heroes like Dadabhai were to come forward to join it. And so long as they do not come forward, we can make no progress in our political life or in any other field of activity.

 DUNCAN’S SPEECH
 Mr. Duncan, former Colonial Secretarylibtech_223_footnoteexpressed the view in the course of a speech that in the long run there was no option but to allow the Coloured races a share in the Government. If this was not done, both the whites and the Coloured races would suffer. That such views are expressed by whites who have held high posts points to the
 
 
 coming of far-reaching changes in South Africa in a few years.
 STALLARD’S VIEWS
 Mr. Stallard is reputed to be a very able lawyer. Though he has no particular regard for us, he said that every time General Smuts had entered into a controversy with the Indian community, he had lost. And that is, in fact, what has happened. He is bound to lose again in this last phase of the struggle if we exert ourselves to our utmost.
 BHANA RAMJI
 Mr. Bhana Ramji was arrested on Saturday for not complying with the notice to leave the Colony. No one had any news about his case. He therefore conducted his own defence. He simply refused to leave the Colony and accepted the sentence of a month’s hard labour which the Magistrate awarded him. He is now installed in gaol. It is our good fortune that Indians have learnt to go to gaol with such ease.

 Mr. Goshalia, who is imprisoned in Volksrust along with other Indians, has sent a telegram to say that Indian prisoners there have been going without breakfast, since they find mealie pap disagreeable. That Mr. Goshalia, as also others, should nonetheless not think of leaving the gaol but stay on where they are is some indication of their patriotism. The question of diet is still the subject of correspondence with the Government. Those who cannot bear these privations should call to mind Mr. Tilak’s case.libtech_224_footnotelibtech_225_footnoteHow will he spend six years on a plain fare? He is old. Had he been a European, he would now be occupying a position of authority. I say this without any ill-will towards the whites. Rather than perpetrate evil as they have done in order to hold political power, it is far better that the Indians should make do with a crust of bread. Anyway, the point is, what we are going through is nothing when compared to the great Mr. Tilak’s sufferings.
 Tuesday [September 8, 1908]
 NATAL BUSINESSMEN’S ACTIVITIES
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and Mr. Anglia have not been idle since their return from Volksrust. They started collecting contributions in Johannesburg, and raised more than £ 200. They went round to all the places and were everywhere given contributions by every-one. They were accompanied by Imam Saheb Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, Mr. Cachalia, Mr. Vyas, Mr. Cama and
 
 others. On Friday after namaz, they went to Krugersdorp, and Mr. Cama was with them. Within three hours, they obtained promises of contributions to the value of £ 64 and collected another £ 60 in cash. They returned from Krugersdorp at night.
 On Saturday, they left for Heidelberg by the morning train. There Mr. Bhayat gave a bold lead by [contributing] £ 16, with the result that a sum of £ 45 was soon raised. They left Heidelberg the same night by train for Standerton. The party included Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Bhayat, Mr. Cama also joined them on the  same  train. Though the train arrived at Standerton at two in the morning, a large number of citizens were present to receive them. My referring to Indians as citizens should not cause surprise. Indians are no longer slaves, but citizens. We have a right to be treated as partners [in the governance of the Colony], and have been fighting for that right.libtech_226_footnotelibtech_227_footnoteA sum of about £ 53 was raised in Standerton.
 Having done all this, these men had a right to rest before the trial began. However, they decided to take the plunge in Pretoria. They left for Pretoria on Sunday by the night train. Having arrived there they lost no time and started  collecting  contributions  on Monday morning. They were looked after by Mr. A. M. Suleman. After breakfast, they went to the city from the Location, and started the collections among the Memons first. Mr. Hajee Cassim gave £ 5. Mr. Gandhi went to Pretoria at 2 p.m. and the work of collection continued till evening. Mr. Hajee Cassim and others also joined the party.
 At four, there was a meeting in the Location with Mr. Bagas in the chair. His welcome address was followed by a suitable reply from the businessmen. There was no time [left] for collections in the Location. But local Indians have promised to take up the work. More than £ 26 were collected in Pretoria.
 Considering Pretoria’s resources, this is too small a sum. But the fact that Memon gentlemen contributed funds and extended their co- operation shows that to that extent they, too, are with the community in its opposition to the law. Their help is bound to produce some
 
 effect on the Government as well. It will realize that a mass of water cannot be cloven asunder by the stroke of a stick, and that Indians are like a mass of water—they are of the same blood.
 The businessmen took the evening train for Durban from the Location. Imam Saheb, Mr. Coovadia, Mr. Fancy, Jivanji, Mr. Omarji Sale, Mr. Vyas and others were present to receive them at Germiston, and to see them off as well. There is a halt of nearly 45 minutes at Germiston. Advantage was taken of this to entertain them at a party arranged in the restaurant. The restaurant-keeper was a good man, and made no trouble. The blinds in the room were lowered so that others outside might not notice the proceedings. The Volksrust train started amid shouts of “hurrah”, and the businessmen left to embrace imprisonment. Is it conceivable that a community,  the  leaders  of which evince such courage, patriotism and enthusiasm, can ever be defeated?
 STORY OF KRUGERSDORP
 Among the Krugersdorp Indians there appears to be a trivial rift, which the authorities intend to exploit. Local newspapers  have reported that Indian traders in Krugersdorp used violence to compel the hawkers to surrender their certificates. The victims have lodged complaints and the offending traders will now be prosecuted.
 This incident is said to have occurred when the Natal busine- ssmen visited Krugersdorp before their deportation. The businessmen, when asked about it, said that no Indian had been harassed or treated violently. An altercation was all that took place and that—on one occasion. If that is so, why do Indians show themselves to be so shortsighted as to become a tool in the hands of the Government to be used against them-selves? Since the case is without any basis, the Government will lose.
 But such rumours may serve to prolong the sufferings of the Indians somewhat. Let every Indian imprint it on his mind that this campaign does not depend on the use of force. There should be neither violence nor threats of violence. Force may be used neither against the Government nor against one’s own fellows.
 This campaign is based on spiritual force. Hence it has a divine sanction. We know that intellectual force is superior to physical force, and spiritual force superior to intellectual force. That is the highest force. We accept this view but do not act upon it. Only to the extent that we are unaware of the soul can there be misery and suffering for us.
 STANDERTON LICENCES
 The Licensing Officer asked the Indian traders at Standerton why they had refused to give their thumb-impressions. In reply, the Committee has said that
  since 	thumb-impressions are 	demanded under the 	obnoxious Act, the 	Indians will not 	give them;  the 	Act is obnoxious because 	it offends 	religious 	susceptibilities and is a symbol of the Indian’s inferior status;  even 	if thumb-impressions 	were demanded—for 	licensing purposes—outside the 	Act, they would be 	refused by 	those who 	could sign 	their names. For, 	giving one’s 	thumb- impression 	when one can easily 	sign one’s 	name will amount 	to a 	stigma on 	oneself for 	the colour of 	one’s skin. There is 	a difference between 	a thumb impression 	given in lieu of 	a signature and that given when the person can sign his name. 
 At  3 p.m.
 We have just received a telegram to say that the three businessmen and Mr. Randeria have been awarded three months’ hard labour each. The remaining eleven received a sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment each with hard labour. I am glad over this report, yet it brings tears to my eyes. I am glad because the greater the suffering inflicted on Indians, the happier they will be in the end and the sooner will come the day of deliverance. I shed tears because they are elderly Indians who are thus made to suffer.
 MORE PRISONERS
 Suleman Hassan, a Krugersdorp hawker, has been sentenced to a fine of 5s or a day’s imprisonment for hawking without a licence. He has elected to go to gaol.
 Mr. Ali Essopji has been arrested for being found in the Colony without a permit. His case will be heard on the 11th.
 In Christiana, Mr. Ibrahim Lindalibtech_228_footnotelibtech_229_footnotehas been sentenced to a fine of £ 15 or six weeks’ imprisonment for carrying on trade [without a licence], and Mr. Cassim to a fine of £ 3 or six weeks’ imprisonment for hawking [without a licence]. Both these brave men have chosen gaol. They have both been sentences to simple imprisonment.
 MEETING  OF BRITISH INDIAN  ASSOCIATION COMMITTEE
A special meeting of the Committee was held on Monday. Mr.
 
 Essop Mia being absent, Mr. Coovadia took the chair. Mr. Fancy, Imam Saheb, Mr. Chettiar, Mr. Naidoo, Mr. Godfrey, Mr. Vyas, Mr. Omarji Sale, Mr. Adam Moosaji, Mr. Kunake and others were present. It was resolved to go round soliciting contributions from people and many names were put down on the list. A resolution was passed that £ 100 should be remitted to Mr. Ritch. Since Mr. Gandhi has suspended his practice for the time being, he asked for provision to be made for the payment of rent for the Association’s office, for permission to defray Mr. Polak’s expenses and to spend £ 10 per month, for the duration of the crisis, to meet the deficit on Indian Opinion resulting from the heavy increase in the quantity of printed matter. No decision was reached on Monday on this item and its consideration was postponed.
 On receipt of information about the imprisonment of the Natal businessmen, another meeting of the Committee was held on Tuesday which was attended by Mr. Essop Mia. Most of those who had attended the previous meeting were present. It was resolved to hold a mass meeting on the following Thursday and to close shops and suspend business on that day out of regard for the Natal leaders. It was also decided to send cables to England, India, Zanzibar, Aden, etc.
 Mr. Essop Mia has announced his intention to resign [from the chairmanship of the British Indian Association] as he wishes to go on a pilgrimage to Mecca. He will take the chair at the mass meeting for the last time—for the present at any rate.
The meeting has resolved to entrust the chairmanship to Mr.
Adam Mahomed Cachalia in succession to Mr. Essop Mia.
 There is no time now to speak at length about this. Mr. Essop Mia’s services to the community have been massive. We owe so much to his courage. The community cannot honour him enough. It is hoped that the community will do its duty [by him] before he boards the ship and leaves on his pilgrimage on the 6th.
 The position that has been offered to Cachalia is a very important one. He has of course done his utmost for the community. He is popular. Also, he has been to gaol. He is thus very well qualified. He was at first extremely reluctant to accept the chairman- ship, but accepted the office under great pressure. Mr. Ibrahim Coovadia’s name was also suggested, but he expressed his preference for Mr. Cachalia, who, he thought, could serve better.
 Mr. Cachalia’s responsibilities are great. It is not an easy thing to take on the captaincy of a ship in mid-ocean. But Mr. Cachalia is
 sure to do full justice to the office he has accepted if he always acts with faith in God.
 I hope to write at greater length next week of Mr. Essop Mia and Mr. Cachalia.
 VOLUNTEERS
 Since Mr. Gandhi has practically suspended his legal practice and Mr. Mahomed Khan has joined business, Mr. James Dorasamy has started attending the Association office to do honorary work. I hope others, too, following Mr. Dorasamy’s example, will come forward to offer their services and thus help the Association’s work. If the community is determined to secure the early release of the Natal heroes, there will be work for as many volunteers as may be forthcoming.
 NYLSTROOM
 Mr. Moti Ragha Patel of Nylstroom has been sentenced to four days’ hard labour for hawking without a licence. A summons is about to be served on Mr. Nagadi.
 ARRESTS IN KRUGERSDORP
 In Krugersdorp warrants have been issued against Mr. Ismail Kazi, Mr. Pandor, Mr. Vaja, Mr. Vania, Mr. Khurshedji Desai, Mr. Dadlani, Mr. Mahomed Mamuji Dadoo and Mr. Parsee Rustomjee on the aforementioned charges.libtech_230_footnoteAll of them, except Mr. Rustomjee, have been released on bail. Since Mr. Rustomjee is already installed in the gaol-palace, it remains to be seen what happens to him.
 Wednesday [September 9, 1908]
 SORABJI
 He [Mr. Sorabji] entered the Transvaal yesterday (Tuesday) evening. His case will come up on the 15th. Mr. Sorabji has already left for Johannesburg in the company of Mr. Cama.
 ABDOOL GANI
 A telegram has been received saying that Mr. Abdool Gani gave his thumb-impression on his return to Volksrust. If true, that is extremely regrettable.

69,"September 9, 1908",PETITION TO SECRETARY OF STATE FOR COLONIESlibtech_231_footnote,"
    
 JOHANNESBURG,
 September 9, 1908
TO
 THE RT. HON’BLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES LONDON
 THE PETITION OF THE BRITISH INDIAN ASSOCIATION OF THE TRANSVAAL
HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT
 PRELIMINARY
    The 			British Indian 			Association approach 			His Majesty’s 			Government in 			connection with 			the British Indian 			struggle that has 			now gone 			on for 			the past two 			years in 			the Transvaal, 			more particularly in 			connection with 			the Asiatic 			Registration Amendment Act, 			gazetted in 			the Transvaal Gazette, 			dated the 			2nd instant.  The 			Association represent 			the British Indian 			community residing 			in the Transvaal.   
  As 	His Majesty’s 	Government are well 	aware, the Asiatic 	Law Amendment Act 	passed last year by 	the Transvaal 	legislature has caused 	much misery to the 	British Indians in 	the Transvaal, 	and has 	involved loss 	of money 	and the incarceration 	of over 	350 Indians, 	who have 	suffered imprisonment for 	conscience’ sake. 
 HASTY LEGISLATION
  The 	Act that has 	now been gazetted was, 	in the 	form of 	a Bill, read a 	first time on 	the 20th 	August, and 	it passed all the stages 	through both the 	Legislative Assembly and 	the Legislative Council 	on the 	21st August. The 	bill was 	never published in 	the Gazette and 	it was only 	after it 	was gazetted as 	an Act that it was available to the community 	represented by 	the petitioning 	Association. By the courtesy 	of a member 	of the Legislative 	Assembly, a few Indians 	were able 	to see 	the Bill after it 	had passed 	through all 	the stages and 	the other 	members of the 	community had, up 	to the 2nd instant, 	to remain 	satisfied with a summary 	published in the Transvaal Press. 
 
 THE ACT GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE
  The 	petitioning Association 	are free to 	admit that 	the Act under discussion 	is a very great advance 	upon the 	Asiatic Law Amendment 	Act No. 	2 of 	1907, though 	it is defective, in that 	it requires proof of 	pre-war residence 	for 3 	years from 	those Asiatics 	who are in 	the Transvaal 	but who have 	not yet received 	registration 	certificates. Most 	of these 	men have entered 	the country 	in bona 	fide manner, 	and have 	acquired vested 	rights. There 	are instances  of 	Asiatics having already received registration certificates, although 	their residence in 	the Transvaal 	before the war did not 	go beyond 	even one 	year. It 	is respectfully 	contended that the 	Asiatics who 	have not 	yet received 	registration certificates but 	who are in the 	Transvaal should 	not be 	treated according to 	the arbitrary 	and inflexible 	limit of 	three years’ 	pre-war residence, which is 	applicable to 	Asiatics who 	are still outside 	the Transvaal.  The 	clause as 	to the granting 	of licences 	will depend for 	smooth working only 	on a 	liberal administration 	as to thumb-print 	requirements. 
 FINGER-PRINTS
  In 	moving the 	second reading of 	the Bill, 	the Colonial 	Secre- tary 	was pleased to 	say that 	finger-impressions or 	thumb-impressions were 	not a 	matter of 	objection. In the humble 	opinion of the petitioning 	Association, in making 	this statement, the Hon’ble Minister 	was less 	than fair to the 	Indian community; for 	he knew 	well that a 	very violent 	agitation was raised 	against finger-prints by 	many Asiatics, 	after the 	compromise of 	last January. 	Whilst it 	is true that 	finger-prints were 	never treated as a 	fundamental objection 	by the 	leading members of 	the Indian 	community, they 	undoubtedly formed, 	as they 	even now do, an 	insupe-rable objection 	to many 	Asiatics, especially 	the Pathans, 	of whom 	there are 	probably over 	150 residing in 	the Colony. 	Finger-impressions or 	thumb-impressions were 	given voluntarily 	under the 	compromise, only 	in order 	to enable 	the Government 	to have 	a scientific 	classification, and to 	show the bona 	fides of 	the community, as 	also its 	willingness to 	help the 	Government. This 	voluntary act 	has cost the community 	very dear. 	Both the Chairman 	and the Secretary 	had to 	suffer grievous bodily 	harm at 	the hands of their fellow-countrymen,libtech_232_footnotelibtech_233_footnoteby reason of the above help given to 	the Government. After 	considerable experience, 	the petitioning 	Association assure His 	Majesty’s Government 	that the compulsory 
 
 
 taking of finger-impressions on any large scale from Asiatics only is bound to give rise to such trouble. Nor are they to any extent necessary, the majority of British Indians having once given them to the authorities. In any case, a very great amount of latitude will be necessary for the smooth working of that part of the administrative machinery.
 ON REPEAL OF ACT 2 OF 1907
  However 	acceptable the measure 	may be 	in comparison with 	the Asiatic Act 	of 1907, 	as has 	already been 	submitted to 	the local 	Government, the 	community represented 	by the 	petitioning Association 	is unable 	to accept 	the benefits 	of the 	measure until Act 	2 to 	1907 is 	removed from 	the Statute-book, and 	the status of 	educated Asiatics 	properly and equitably 	defined. In the 	humble opinion of 	the petitioning 	Association, repeal of 	the Act is 	necessary, if 	only for the 	honour of 	the Government. 
 PROMISE OF REPEAL
  It 	is respectfully 	contended that the 	Hon’ble the 	Colonial Secretary had 	definitely promised 	repeal on condition 	that the Asiatic 	part of 	the compromise 	was carried 	out by 	the Asiatic 	communities. It is 	admitted that 	the Asiatics have 	more than fulfilled 	their obligation 	under the compromise.  But 	it has 	been argued that Justice 	Solomon, in the 	course of 	his  judgementlibtech_234_footnotelibtech_235_footnoteon 	 the  application  for 	  the  return  of 	  a  voluntary 	registration 	application, stated that 	promise of 	repeal was 	not proved, and 	that, therefore, 	it was not 	given. The 	petitioning Association 	venture to 	draw the 	attention of 	His Majesty’s 	Government to the 	fact that the question 	of repeal 	was not before 	the Court and the 	decision did 	not turn upon that 	question at 	all. It 	was definitely 	stated before 	the Court 	that all the evidence 	in the 	possession of 	the applicant 	with reference 	to the 	repeal was 	not brought before the 	Court. Sufficient 	was stated on that subject in the affidavitslibtech_236_footnotelibtech_237_footnotesupporting the application, in 	order to 	provide a 	moral basis, the 	applicant intending to 	show that 	his desire 	to withdraw 	his application 	for voluntary 	registration was not 	based on 	caprice but 	on what 	he believed 	to be a 	breach of 	faith by 	the local Government.  That 	repeal of 	the Act was the goal of 	the signatories 	to the 	letterlibtech_238_footnotelibtech_239_footnoteaddressed to the Colonial Secretary, and dated the 29th January, can be inferred from the letter itself, [a] portion of which reads as 
 
 follows:
 Under these circumstances, we would once more respectfully suggest to the Government that all Asiatics over the age of 16 should be allowed within a certain limited period, say three months, to register themselves, and that to all who so register the Act be not applied.
 The original draft placed before the signatories had the expression “the penalties of” before the words “the Act”. This was struck out, the idea being that, if the Act did not apply to all who voluntarily registered, and if all Asiatics voluntarily registered, there would be no occasion to retain the Act on the Statute-book, the necessary provision for separating authorized Asiatic residents from unauthorized residents being taken over in any legalizing Bill that might be passed.
  This, 	however, was not all. 	The second 	signatory hereto, who 	was also 	one of the signatories 	to the letter 	in question, 	was summoned 	to Pretoria, and 	had an interview with 	the Hon’ble the Colonial Secretary 	and at 	the interview 	he was 	given to understand 	that, if 	the Asiatics 	honourably fulfilled 	their obligation, the 	Act would be repealed.libtech_240_footnotelibtech_241_footnoteThis 	 was  on 	 the  30th 	 January. 	 On  discussion 	  with 	 the 	Registrar of 	Asiatics which took 	place after the 	interview with the Colonial 	Secretary, the second 	signatory’s suspicion was 	aroused as 	to the 	Asiatic Act being 	repealed. He, 	therefore, addressed  to 	 the Colonial Secretary, 	on the 	1st February last, 	a letter showing his suspicion.libtech_242_footnote 
 On the 3rd February, upon receipt of a telegraphic message asking him to wait on the Colonial Secretary, he did so, and, in the presence of the Registrar of Asiatics, as he has already stated in his affidavit before the Supreme Court, the Colonial Secretary made the promise of repeal; and, within the knowledge of the first signatory to this petition, this promise was brought to the notice of vast audiences of British Indians, at several meetings just after the interviews hereinbefore referred to.
  On 	the 5th day 	of February 	last, the Colonial 	Secretary spoke 	as follows 	at a 	meeting at 	Richmond: “He 	had told them that 	the law could 	not be 	repealed so 	long as 	there was 	an Asiatic 	in the 	country who had not registered.” And again, “Until every Indian in 
 
 
 the country had registered, the law would not be  repealed.”  The above extract has been taken from The Star of the 6th February last. The same remark was also reported in The Transvaal Leader of the same date.
  On 	his way to 	the Registration 	Office, on 	the 10th day of 	February last, the 	second signatory hereto 	was very 	severely assaulted, 	because he 	was going to 	give his 	digit-impressions. For 	the time being, 	registration came 	practically to 	a standstill. 	The Asiatics 	were fright- 	ened; they were 	suspicious as to the 	intentions of 	the Government, and 	their suspicious 	were strengthened 	by reason 	of receipts 	for the few 	applications that were 	made having been given on 	old forms, 	which had 	reference to 	the Asiatic 	Law Amendment 	Act, No. 	2 of 	1907. In 	order to 	allay such suspicions, 	the Registrar declared 	to several prominent  Asiatics, 	 as 	 also 	 to  the  Assistant 	 Hon. 	  Secretarylibtech_243_footnotelibtech_244_footnoteof 	  the 	British Indian 	Association, who 	is also 	an Attorney 	of the 	Supreme Court 	of the 	Transvaal, that, 	voluntary registration 	being completed, 	the Act would 	be repealed. 	In order 	further to popularize 	voluntary registration, 	the Registrar 	of Asiatics 	was willing 	to publish 	a notice 	in the 	Gazette that, 	Asiatics undergoing 	voluntary registration, the 	Act would 	be repealed. This 	notice was 	brought before the 	second signatory hereto 	by the 	Registrar, whilst he 	was still 	in bed, 	and, after some 	amendments, it 	was agreed 	between the Registrar 	and him that 	the notice 	should be published 	in the 	Gazette. 	In the 	meanwhile, the 	verbal assurances given 	by the 	Registrar had 	their desired effect, 	and registration 	was going 	on smoothly. 	The Registrar, 	therefore, on again 	visiting the second 	signatory hereto 	inquired whether it was 	still necessary to 	publish the 	notice, and 	the second signatory, on 	learning that 	registration was going 	on smoothly, 	replied in the negative.  On 	the 22nd 	day of 	February, the 	second signatory 	hereto submitted, 	for the 	Colonial Secretary’s 	approval, and 	with his permission, a draft Billlibtech_245_footnotelibtech_246_footnote, amending the Immigrants’ Restriction Act and 	repealing the 	Asiatic Act. 	This letter was 	duly acknowledged, but 	there was no repudiation of the reference to repeal of that Act.  Lastly, 	whilst the Colonial 	Secretary has stated, in 	his affidavitlibtech_247_footnotelibtech_248_footnotebefore the Supreme Court, that he never promised repeal of the 	Act, and whilst 	the Registrar of 	Asiatics had 	supported that 	affidavit, the 	Colonial Secretary 	does not, 	as will appear from 	his speech 	on the 	second reading 	of the 	Bill, seriously 	repudiate the 
 
 promise, and, at any rate, admits having freely discussed with the second signatory hereto the question of repeal.
  Several 	statements made by 	British Indians, to 	whom the assurance as 	to repeal 	was given by 	the Registrar of 	Asiatics, are attached hereto.libtech_249_footnote  Moreover, 	the petitioning 	Association draw the 	attention of 	His Majesty’s 	Government to the fact 	that a repealing 	Bill was actually drawn 	[up] and 	ordered to 	be printed for 	private circulation 	by the 	Colonial Secretary, and 	was shown to 	the second 	signatory, and 	was only 	withdrawn, because 	the second 	signatory hereto 	requested that 	certain amendments 	should be made 	therein, all 	of which, 	with some 	modifications, have 	now been embodied in 	the Act under 	discussion, with the exception of that affecting the status of educated Asiatics. 
 RETENTION OF ACT UNNECESSARY
  Apart, 	however, from 	the promise 	made by the 	Colonial Secretary, the 	retention of 	two parallel 	enactments dealing with 	the same 	matter cannot but lead 	to harassing 	and unfortunate 	results. It has 	been stated that 	the intention of 	the Government 	is to treat 	Act 2 of 	1907 as 	a dead 	letter. But it is 	impossible for the 	community represented 	by the 	petitioning Association 	to remain in 	a state of uncertainty 	after a prolonged 	and bitter 	struggle. The powers 	given by the 	two measures may, in the hands 	of ignorant, 	incapable,  or 	prejudiced officials, be 	used against 	British Indians  with 	 deadly results.  The 	petitioning Association 	may be 	permitted to 	remark that 	the later 	measure in no way 	neutralizes the 	effect of 	Act 2 	of 1907. 	Either may, 	at the 	option of 	the Government, be used 	against the Asiatic 	communities. Similarly, it is open to Asiatics to take advantage, if 	there by 	any, of 	either enactment.  For 	instance, whilst, under 	the new measure, Turkish 	Mahomedans are 	free from 	the irksome 	process of 	registration, a Turkish 	Mahomedan entering the 	Transvaal may 	be dealt 	with under Act 	2 of 	1907. One 	of the 	main objections, 	therefore, of the 	British Indian 	community still remains without redress. The 	remarks made by 	the colonial 	Secretary that 
 they (the Asiatics) put the difficulties in this way—that, under Act 2 of 1907, the definition given of Asiatic in the old Volksraad Act No. 3, 1885, was maintained, and in that definition Turkish Mahomedans, subjects of the  Turkish Empire, were excluded from this country. It was urged that that was not
 a provision intended to keep Turks out of the country, but was simply casting  a slur and a stigma on the Mahomedan religion, which no white person or the Government has the slightest intention of doing. The number of Turks here has always been small, and I am told that there are none now, and in any case there is no danger of any influx from Turkey to this country. The only kind of Turkish subjects who do come here are Christians, and they are Syrians and other Levantines, against whom certain hon. members have strong objection. But they are Christians, and Mahomedan subjects of the Turkish Empire have never threatened, and are never likely to threaten, to invade this country. That objection, which was based on sentimental grounds, and which there was no difficulty on material grounds in meeting, we have met, and hon. members will see that the Bill now before the House strikes out that restriction which was placed against the immigration of a man simply because he was a Mahomedan subject of the Turkish Empire.
are wide of the mark.
  Again, 	whilst the Act under 	discussion frees 	minors from personal 	registration, Act 2 	of 1907 	can conceivably be 	used against 	such minors, and 	can give rise to 	endless trouble.  The 	offensive liquor 	clause finds 	no place 	in the new measure, 	but it 	is open to 	an Asiatic to 	apply for 	a permit 	of exemp- 	tion under the old Act. 	It will, 	perhaps, be 	said that this is 	manifestly an advantage. 	But, in 	the humble 	opinion of the 	petitioning Associa- 	tion, the implied insult still disfigures the Statute-book of the Colony.libtech_250_footnote  It 	would be 	open to 	the Government 	to deal 	with an un- 	registered Asiatic under 	either Act, and thus 	subject such an Asiatic 	to pinpricks 	at every turn.  The 	retention of 	the old Act opens 	the way for frauds 	by un-scrupulous 	Asiatics. Whilst the 	new Act provides for 	application for 	registration being 	made from a place 	in South 	Africa outside the 	Colony, there is 	nothing to 	prevent an 	Asiatic from entering 	the Colo- 	ny and claiming 	to remain 	in it for 	seven days, under the 	Act, and, during 	that time, 	merging into the 	community beyond 	recognition.  Illustrations 	like the foregoing 	can be 	multiplied. But 	the above, 	it is trusted, 	will sufficiently show how 	precarious the 	position of 	British Indians will be 	rendered, if 	the old enactment 	be allowed 	to remain on 	the Statute-book 	of the Colony.  Even 	whilst the new Act is under 	consideration by 	His Majesty’s 	Government, the local 	Government have commenced prose- 	cutions against those who are covered and protected by it. Thus, a 
 
 
 British   Indianlibtech_251_footnotelibtech_252_footnotepossessing   good    educational   qualifications    and, therefore, easily recognizable, and moreover, possessing a Peace Preservation Ordinance permit and a certificate voluntarily taken out under Lord Milner’s advice,libtech_253_footnotelibtech_254_footnotewas arrested, after the passing of the new measure, and tried under the old Act, for being an  unregistered Asiatic. The Magistrate, although he expressed surprise, had no option but to give him notice to quit the Colony within seven days. Thus, it is possible to denude the Colony of many lawfully resident Asiatics by prosecuting them under the old Act, although they are protected by the new Act.
  Another 	Indian, well known to 	the authorities, 	a merchant 	of Piet 	Retief, holding 	residential certificates, has 	just been tried under 	the old Act, and 	sentenced to 	pay a 	fine or 	go to gaol for 	14 days 	without hard 	labour, not 	because he 	is not entitled 	to reside 	in the 	Colony, but 	because he 	has refused 	to give his 	thumb-impression. During 	his trial, 	the principal 	witness for the Crown 	admitted that 	he knew 	the merchant to 	be a resident 	of the 	Transvaal, and 	the solicitor who 	had accompanied him 	when he 	obtained his 	permit also 	gave evidence to 	identify him. 	Mr. Ebrahim Osman (that 	is the 	merchant’s name), 	rather than pay a 	fine which 	he deemed 	to be an extortion, 	has elected 	to suffer 	imprisonment, and 	is now 	serving his 	term at His Majesty’s gaol at Volksrust.libtech_255_footnotelibtech_256_footnoteMr. Ebrahim Osman can read and write English 	and can 	give a well-formed 	signature in the Roman 	character[s].  Under 	the circumstances, 	the petitioning 	Association trust that 	His Majesty’s 	Government will 	secure repeal of 	the  old Act before 	sanctioning the new Act. 
 STATUS OF EDUCATED INDIANS
  If 	the old Act were 	removed from the 	Statute-book, it 	would seem 	that there would be no 	hindrance to 	educated Asiatics 	being placed on 	the same footing 	as His 	Majesty’s other 	subjects, so 	far as 	immigration is concerned.  The 	Immigrants’ 	Restriction Act 15 	of 1907 	imposes a general 	education test, 	and, under it, any 	Asiatic who 	can pass the education 	test is 	not otherwise 	prohibited and may enter 	the Colony. He 	then becomes 	subject to registration 	under the Asiatic 	Act, and, if 	he fails to comply with it, he becomes an unregistered Asiatic, though 
 
 not yet a prohibited immigrant. Thus, Mr. Sorabji Shapurji entered the Colony under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act. He was allowed to pass through unchallenged. After seven days’  residence in  the Colony, he was prosecuted for being unregistered under Act 2 of 1907.libtech_257_footnotelibtech_258_footnoteMr. Sorabji had applied for voluntary registration. That was refused. He was not prepared to submit to Act 2 of 1907. He held excellent testimonials from the Town Clerk of Charlestown and other prominent officials of that town. The Magistrate at Volksrust had recommended his application. He is educated up to the seventh standard of the Surat High School, and has often acted as Interpreter at the Court at Charlestown. On being tried under the Asiatic Act, he received notice to quit the Colony.libtech_259_footnotelibtech_260_footnoteThis notice he, as a British subject, declined to comply with. He was thereupon prosecuted, and sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour for one month, without the option of a fine.libtech_261_footnotelibtech_262_footnoteMr. Sorabji served his term, and, on the last day of his imprisonment, was secretly deported.
  The 	petitioning Association 	venture respectfully to 	submit that 	such method of 	dealing with 	inoffensive British subjects in a British Colony is without precedent.  Mr. 	Sorabji’s case 	shows that the 	Immigrants’ 	Restriction Act 	does not 	create a 	colour bar. The 	above view seems to 	be borne out 	by the 	case of Rex 	v. Lalloo 	heard in 	the Supreme 	Court of the 	Transvaal on the 22nd July last.libtech_263_footnote  It 	is the Asiatic 	Act, which 	is ostensibly 	only intended 	to identify 	those who could 	not otherwise 	be easily 	identified, that stands 	in the 	way of educated Indians.  The 	petitioning Association 	respectfully claim that 	as in the 	other Colonies, 	educated Asiatics should have 	the right of free 	entry, subject 	only to 	general education 	test applicable 	to all. 	It would 	be unreasonable 	and highly 	insulting and 	degrading to 	expect such 	Asiatics to 	undergo processes of 	identification and 	carry certificates 	for which 	there can never 	be the slightest necessity.  The 	petitioning Association 	invite the attention of 	His Majesty’s 	Government to 	the fact that foreigners, 	if they 	are Europeans, 	and the natives 	of South 	Africa, provided they 	pass the education 	test, can enter the 	Transvaal. Educated 	British Indians are, 	therefore, placed lower 	than either of the two 	classes above named. It 	is right that 	the Malays, who 	are inhabitants of 	South 
 
 Africa, should be free to enter the Transvaal, but the petitioning Association fail to see why Indians born in South Africa should not be placed in the same category. There are many Indian youths to whom South Africa is their only home, and India a foreign land.
  It 	has been 	stated that the keeping 	of the 	door open for 	the entry 	of educated Indians 	would flood 	the Colony 	with “half- 	educated Indian 	lads”, who would 	compete with 	the general 	body of 	the Europeans 	in the 	Colony. The 	petitioning Association 	have never 	raised any 	such contention. The 	severity of 	the education 	test will not 	be questioned. 	It is the 	class and 	colour distinction 	in the 	laws even 	with regard 	to educated 	Indians that is 	respectfully resented. 	Natal admits 	very few Indians 	per year 	under the education test.  What 	the petitioning 	Association desire is 	that educated Indians 	of high culture, 	professional men, 	men with 	 University degrees, 	should be able 	to enter 	the Colony as 	of right. Such 	men are naturally 	required for the wants 	of the 	resident community.  Further, 	it has been suggested 	that relief 	for  educated Indians 	is obtainable 	under Section 	16 of the 	new Act, as 	it is under the 	old Act. But 	such is 	not the case. 	That section contemplates only a 	temporary permit 	and does 	not enable the holder 	to follow any 	independent calling. 	That section, 	the petitioning 	Association under- 	stand, is 	intended to 	provide for 	the temporary sojourn in 	the Colony 	of Asiatics, 	whether they are 	educated or 	not, and 	contemplated the 	giving of 	facility to 	merchants to 	import, under temporary 	permits, clerks 	and other 	employees for their wants.  The 	relief sought by 	the petitioning 	Association is different 	in kind. 	Educated Indians who 	can pass a test, 	no matter 	how severe, 	should come 	under the 	general immigration 	law, and should 	not be 	subjected to 	registration, etc.  If 	the educated 	Indians who are already 	in the 	Colony have 	sub-mitted to 	registration, they 	have done so only 	to set 	an example 	and assist 	the Government, 	and to 	free those few 	who may be allowed 	to enter 	the Colony 	from galling 	and needless 	restrictions on 	their personal freedom.  It 	may be remarked that the 	immigration of 	Asiatics was 	free before 	the war. After 	the conclusion 	of peace, it was 	generally controlled 	under the Peace 	Preservation Ordinance. The 	Asiatic Act 	of 1907 	did not regulate 	immigration of Asiatics 	but it 	provided for 	the registration 	of Asiatics 	already domiciled 	in the 	Colony. It 	was still 	open to 	Asiatics to 	receive permits the 	same as 	Europeans under 	the Peace 	Preservation Ordinance, 	and, as 	a matter 	of fact, 	serveral did 	receive such permits. 	Then followed 	the Immigrants’ Restriction 
 Actlibtech_264_footnotelibtech_265_footnotewhich replaced the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and laid down a general education test for newcomers. Thus, but for the Asiatic Act, there never has been a legal interruption of the entry of educated Asiatics into the Colony. It is, therefore, not true, as has been locally stated, that British Indians are raising any new contention.  The question was first raised by the Hon’ble the Colonial Secretary when, in his repealing Bill, herein before referred to, he wished so to amend the Immigrants’ Restriction Act as to prohibit the immigration of all educated Asiatics.
 PASSIVE RESISTANCE
  The 	petitioning Association 	feel aggrieved that 	His Majesty’s 	Government were pleased 	not to 	listen to 	the prayer 	of the 	Association and the Deputation that was sent to London in 1906libtech_266_footnotelibtech_267_footnoteand 	that Act 	2 of 1907 was sanctioned.  The 	petitioning Association 	draw the attention of 	His Majesty’s 	Government to the 	fact that the 	Deputation placed 	before them 	the fourth 	Resolution of 	the Mass 	Meeting of 	British Indians held at the Empire Theatre in the September of 1906.libtech_268_footnotelibtech_269_footnoteThe resolution runs 	as follows: 
 In the event of the Legislative Council, the local Government,  and  the Imperial authorities rejecting the humble prayer of the British Indian community of the Transvaal in connection with the Draft Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance, this Mass Meeting of British Indians here assembled solemnly and regretfully resolves that, rather than submit to the galling, tyrannous, and un-British requirements laid down in the above Draft Ordinance, every British Indian in the Transvaal shall submit himself to imprisonment and shall continue so to do until it shall please His Most Gracious Majesty the King-Emperor to grant relief.
 The 	Resolution evidently 	carried very little 	weight with His 	Majesty’s Government. 	But what 	has happened 	since has demons- 	trated the 	earnestness of 	the meeting.  The  following 	  passage 	  occurs 	  in  a  general  petitionlibtech_270_footnotepresented to 	the local 	Government in 1907: 
 Nothing short of total repeal of the Act can meet the difficult situation that has arisen. In our humble opinion, the Act is degrading to our self-respect, offensive to our religions, and in its incidence it is such as can be thought of only in connection with dangerous criminals. Moreover, the solemn
 
 declaration made by us renders it imperative for us, as honest citizens of the Empire and God-fearing men, not to submit to the provisions of the Act, irrespective of any consequences which we may have to suffer, and which we understand to be imprisonment, banishment, and/or loss or confiscation of our property.
  In 	order to 	secure the 	object, over 350 	Indians have suffered 	imprisonment. Several 	have allowed their goods to 	be sold. Some have 	accepted dismissal from 	Government or 	private employ, rather 	than stifle 	the voice 	of conscience. 	And almost 	all have suffered much 	pecuniary loss, some 	having been actually reduced to poverty.  The 	petitioning Association 	have chosen this 	method of 	drawing attention to 	the grievous 	wrong suffered by them 	as being 	the method most 	consistent with 	their status as 	British subjects, and 	with their 	self-respect as men.  The 	movement has 	been described as 	passive resistance for 	want of 	a better 	term. But it 	amounts to 	respectful protest 	against legisla-tion 	which British 	Indians resent, and in 	framing which 	they had 	no voice.  It 	is respectfully 	submitted that there 	can be 	no notion of 	resistance, as 	the word is 	ordinarily understood, 	in a 	body of 	men undergoing 	personal suffering.  The 	petitioning Association 	have learnt from 	experience  that, 	within the British Empire, at any 	rate, subjects of 	the King- 	Emperor get 	real redress of 	grievances only 	when they show that they 	are ready and willing to suffer for the sake of obtaining relief.  British 	Indians have been taught 	from their childhood 	that, in 	the eye of 	the law, 	under the British 	Constitution, all 	subjects are 	equal. When, however, 	they dare to claim 	such equality in the 	Colony, they 	are jeered 	at or considered impudent.  British 	Indians have no 	franchise and, 	in the 	present state of 	public feeling, 	they desire 	none. The 	only remedy 	left to them, therefore, 	is to petition 	the rulers 	and, as a measure 	 of  their earnestness, 	be prepared 	to suffer 	for their opinions.  So 	far as 	the petitioning 	Association have been 	able to ascertain 	the Indian 	feeling, the 	determination of 	the great 	majority of them 	is humbly 	to continue 	to suffer 	and refuse 	to accept 	the benefits 	under the new Act, 	until elementary justice 	requested by the 	Indians has 	been granted. 
 
 CONCLUSION
  In 	conclusion, the 	petitioning Association 	respectfully submit 	and pray 	that, if His Majesty’s 	Government cannot 	secure justice 	for British 	Indians residing in the 	Colony by 	securing repeal of 	Act 2 of 	1907 and 	by having the 	status of  educated  	Indians established, 	in consonance with 	the Principles of the 	British Constitution, the terms of the gracious Proclamation of 1858libtech_271_footnotelibtech_272_footnotemay be withdrawn, 	and they 	may be 	told that, 	for them, 	the  expression “British 	subject” is to bear 	a meaning 	different to 	what it 	possesses for 	Europeans. And 	for this act, etc., etc.

71,"September 9, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE STAR”,"
    
 [JOHANNESBURG,]
 September 9, 1908 The sentence of three months’ hard labour passed by the Volksrust Magistrate yesterday on the Indians who were deported and who re-entered  the   Colony   has,
according to the Indian method of reasoning, considerably helped their cause, and it
 is apparent that they hope that such incidents in the campaign will force the Imperial Government to intervene on their behalf. There was quite a feeling of optimism pervading Mr. Gandhi’s office today when a reporter of The Star called on him. The leader of the passive resistance movement said:
 While it is true that we Indians have got what we asked for, it does not reflect any credit on the Government, which makes it almost imperative on the courts to impose such heavy sentences on men who, after all, are political opponents. I consider this to be a wicked abuse of power placed in the hands of the Government over an unrepr- esented class. I think that these sentences mean the end of the deportation farce, but if the farce is to be continued, and if I know the temper of my countrymen correctly, they will certainly continue to re- enter and demand their rights as British subjects. When I talk of equality of treatment in the eye of the law the idea is jeered at, but I am in good company, as Col. Seely himself has advanced the same plea.libtech_274_footnotelibtech_275_footnoteTo my mind, it is the only thing that binds the Empire together. Immediately the idea of legal inequality is introduced, you sap the foundation of the Empire. By this idea I do not  mean that  the Colonies should not have the right to restrict immigration. The late Sir Henry Parke’s remarks cannot be questioned, but once you admit people into the Colony, they must enjoy equality of treatment before the law. Otherwise, as Mr. Duncan has only recently stated, you create  a state of slavery, the result being that the slave-owners, that is the governing class, must in the end be much worse off than the slaves.libtech_276_footnote
 
superior race just as much as for the inferior.”
 
 History does not show an instance of people having become a free nation and yet remaining slave-owners. If we are not to be treated as slaves, then we want men whose presence would conduce to our free growth. These men are undoubtedly those who have culture and education, and it is for an infinitesimal number of this class that we are pleading for free ingress.
 Asked if the principle were conceded, would the Indians be prepared to submit to a severe education test, Mr. Gandhi said:
 If the test in the present Immigrants’ Restriction Law does not admit of a proper stiff test being laid down, which I deny, it can be amended, even as it has been in Australia. Under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act there will then be legal equality, but in administering that Act it will be open to the officials to alter the severity of the test as circumstances may require. For instance, in Natal today Europeans are almost passed unchallenged, while Indians are subjected to a rigorous test. That administrative difference must continue so long as the prejudice continues.
 On it being pointed out that Mr. Gandhi’s statement did not advance the situation, he replied that he took his stand on Lord Milner’s Kimberley speechlibtech_277_footnote,
Let there be no more pinpricks for the Uitlander,
and, added Mr. Gandhi:
We are now the Uitlanders, strangers in our own home.

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 September 10, 1908] Mr. Gandhi in the course of a brief address referred to a telegram from the Volksrust Indians in support of the meeting. The information in this telegram was
that their leaders were breaking stones in the public streets and refusing to eat the raw
 meat supplied to them as prison food. He (Mr. Gandhi) considered that what seemed degrading work was really an honour. (Applause.) The reason for their suffering made him proud of his countrymen. It was a disgrace, however, that their Government should act thus—it reflected no credit on the local or the British or the Indian Government which found no power to protect the people that had left its borders. Further, a telegram from Boksburg announced that a pedlar had been sentenced to six
 
 weeks’ hard labour for trading without a licence. Six weeks would be the minimum sentence in future. Mr. Sorabjee had said that he was willing to suffer twelve months’ hard labour, but it depended on the firm attitude to those who remained outside how long the time would be for those inside. (Applause.)

           [JOHANNESBURG, 
  Before 	September 12, 1908] 	In B Court today before 	Mr. H. H. Jordan, an Indian. named Randaree was charged with remaining in 	the Colony after the expiry of his temporary permit to stay, 	and after being warned to leave by the authorities.  He 	pleaded not guilty, and was defended by Mr. Gandhi.  Superintendent 	J.G. Vernon said that on 	August 15 	he called upon the 	accused to 	produce his 	authority for 	remaining in 	the transvaal 	after being warned by 	the Registrar 	of Asiatics 	to quit. 	He replied 	that he had 	no authority, 	but had made 	a further 	application to remain. 	On instructions, 	witness arrested accused.  James 	Cody, in the office of the Registrar 	of Asiatics, 	Pretoria,  said 	 a temporary permit to 	reside in 	the Transvaal 	was granted 	by the 	Registrar of 	Asiatics on 	the 10th 	March last for three 	months. Accused applied for 	an extension 	on the 	9th of June, and this was refused on the 24th July by letter.  THE 	MAGISTRATE: You allowed 	him to stay until then?  WITNESS: 	He gave certain reasons 	for wishing to stay. We investigated these reasons, and decided that 	the permit should be refused.  MR. GANDHI: Are you aware 	that the accused’s father is in Johannesburg?  WITNESS: 	I cannot say for certain. 	Randaree went into the box. [GANDHIJI:] 	I understand that you intended to leave after the  	expiry of your permit and re-enter the Transvaal under the 	Immigration Restriction Act?  [ACCUSED:] 	Yes, but fortunately I happened to be arrested here.  The 	accused asked leave to make a short statement, but the Magistrate 	pointed out that he had a very able solicitor defending him.  [GANDHIJI:] 	It does not matter.  And 	the accused went back to the prisoner’s box.  The 	Prosecutor said the position with regard to the accused was as if 	the Court had ordered him to leave the Colony within seven days and 	he had refused to do so.  The 	Magistrate sentenced the accused to one month’s hard labour.  Indian 	Opinion, 12-9-1908

75,,NATAL MEETINGS,"
    
 Mass meetings are being held in Natal. Also, resolutions are passed at these meetings. Petitions will be sent to the Government. This is all very well. It was necessary to adopt these measures. But Natal Indians must realize that petitions are useless unless backed by sanction. This is what one learns from experience everywhere.
 And satyagraha is our sanction. For Natal, satyagraha means that every Indian should make up his mind to carry on trade without a licence. We know of course that the new Billslibtech_284_footnotewill not go through. But it is necessary to have the old lawlibtech_285_footnote—the Act of 1897—repealed. If it is true that the Indian community has grown in strength, it must petition the Government to the following effect: “We propose to carry on trade without licences as long as the Act of 1897 does not provide for appeal [to the Supreme Court], as long as old licences are not protected and as long as the £ 3 poll-taxlibtech_286_footnoteon indentured labourers is not repealed.”
 This will serve two interests: one’s own as well as those of others. One’s own because there will be an end to the harassment over licences. Other’s interests in that the poll-tax on the long-suffering indentured labourers will disappear, and they will be sincerely  grateful. A pledge by the Indian community that it will not sit back until the hardships of the indentured labourers are ended, that it will suffer with them, will have a profound import. If the Indian community takes this pledge sincerely, it is as good as a kingdom won. It will mean swarajya.
 Everyone will see that there is no alternative. But it may be asked whether concerted action will ever be possible, whether we can ever hope to win. It will be folly to ask this question. In any great venture, the number of those that take the lead is invariably small. At first the Prophet strove aided only by a handful; Jesus had a very small band of followers to begin with. Hampdenlibtech_287_footnotewas alone in refus- ing to pay the ship-money. It did not even occur to him to consider whether or not others would follow  him.  The  late  Mr.  Bradlaughlibtech_288_footnote
 
 awed an entire House of Commons into submission. The Grand Old Man of India—Dadabhai—was a lone figure fifty years ago. During the early years, he fought on with inexhaustible energy. Very few joined him in showing up the defects of British rule in India. Today the people of India enjoy the fruit of his labours. Now others want to go even farther than he did.libtech_289_footnote
 Natal Indians should call these examples to mind, and not cling meekly to the illusion that something can be achieved only if all of them act in unison. Rather, all traders and hawkers who can act with courage should take the pledge.

76,,SMILES OR TEARS?,"
    
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee and Mr. Anglia— these three are serving a sentence of three months’ hard labour for the sake of their motherland. There are also other Indians with them—all of them educated persons. What does this signify? If this had come to pass before January last, it would have raised a storm of indignation in the Indian community. It could just not have happened then. Times have changed since, and the thing has happened. Even so, the incident causes a painful wound.
 It will make every Indian weep to think of the wives, children and relatives of these brave ones, or of their sufferings. It will make every Indian miserable. We send our sympathies to their families.
 However, these fifteen heroes have gone to gaol for the country, for the sake of its honour. They went to gaol with a smile. This should make every Indian’s face shine with joy. These men, their families as well as the Indian people, deserve congratulations on this heroism of theirs.
 Let us not assume that the matter will end with tears  and laughter. The duty of Indians who remain outside is becoming more difficult. It lies in our hands to bring about their early release. If people refuse to take out a licence, or to give a thumb-impression or any other mark of identification, if everyone remains  courageous,  they will be released very shortly, and no wonder. If that is not done, the Indian people will stand discredited. They will lose face. We hope
 
 that they will follow the example of these brave heroes and prepare for a determined effort.

77,,SALUTE THE COURT,"
    
 Sir Henry Bale has made some sharp remarks on saluting. He go the impression that a certain Indian who entered his court did no salute him as he came in. He therefore remarked that Indians, who were known to be a civilized people, should respect the dignity of the court. He added that Indians should show respect to the court by taking off their turbans or their shoes or by salaaming on entering the court-room. Those who failed to do any of these three things would invite punishment. Sir Henry addressed these remarks to all  the  Indians present and had them translated for their  benefit.  Every  Indian must heed this warning. It will be a good practice anywhere to salute the court on entering it. Many Indians fail to do this through sheer carelessness. It is our duty to observe correct etiquette.

 Sir Henry Bale’s remarks in the Indian murder case deserve not to be brushed aside lightly. He observed that some Indians make many false statements in support of their plea.libtech_291_footnotelibtech_292_footnoteThis sometimes spoils a good case. This is often true. It will not be right for one to defend Indians by asking whether whites do not act similarly in support of their case. Of course, they do make false statements. But that is no reason why we should follow suit. Instead of worrying about winning or losing the case, we should resolve that we would speak nothing but the truth. The best way is not to have to knock at the doors of lawyers or courts. Why can we not ensure that civil or criminal cases involving Indians are not taken to court? All this should be possible through the satyagraha that we have adopted.

 JOHANNESBURG,
 September 14, 1908
 [THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES LONDON]
 THE PETITION OF THE UNDERSIGNED, REPRESENTING THE PATHANS AND THE PUNJABIS RESIDENT IN THE TRANSVAAL
HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT
    The 			Petitioners 			respectfully approach His 			Majesty’s Govern- 			ment with reference to 			the Asiatic 			Law Amendment 			Act, and the reply 			given to 			the Petitioners 			on the 			26th day of March, 			1908 in 			connection with 			their humble representation, as follows:   
 I have the honour, by direction, to inform you that the  Petition enclosed in your letter of the 13th January respecting the position of yourself and others under the Asiatic Registration Act has been received by  the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord Elgin has requested His Excellency Lord Selborne to inform you that he has perused the Petition with attention but that, especially in view of the recent settlement of the  difficulties  in connection with registration under the Act, it does not now appear to him to be necessary to take any action with regard to it.
    In 			the Petition, to which 			the above reply was 			sent, the Petitioners 			[had] prayed as follows:   
 His Majesty’s Indian soldiers cannot, consistent with the dignity of a soldier, degrade themselves by being compelled to register in such a manner, and, should His Majesty’s Government be unable to obtain just treatment for the King-Emperor’s Indian soldiers in the Transvaal, then they ask as men and British Indian soldiers, who are proud to have risked their lives in the cause of the Empire and have braved the privations of war, to be spared the degradation of imprisonment or deportation, and further wish that the King-Emperor will command that they be shot by Generals Botha and Smuts on one of the battle- fields of South Africa, where they have been under fire whilst serving their King-Emperor and the British Empire.
    As 			recent events have 			shown, the 			settlement to 			which the 			reply has 			reference has 			fallen through, and 			the whole of 			the Indian 			community is 			now making 			representations to 			His Majesty’s 			Government for repeal of the Act, which repeal all Indians were given   
 
 to understand was part of the compromise.
    It 			was because the 			whole of the 			Indian community 			represented by 			your Petitioners 			distrusted the 			compromise, and 			felt greatly 			agitated as to the 			uncertainty as 			to the repeal, 			and because 			the principle of 			registration by 			finger-prints was 			accepted by 			the leaders 			of the 			Indian community, 			that some of 			the members 			of the 			section represented 			by your 			Petitioners showed 			their resentment of 			the action 			by resorting 			to physical 			violence. Whilst 			such method 			of showing 			resentment cannot 			be approved 			by your Petitioners, 			the suspicion 			entertained by 			them was 			evidently well grounded. The 			position of 			your Petitioners is 			briefly as 			follows:   
  Your 	Petitioners consider the 	whole spirit of 	the Asiatic 	Law Amendment 	Act No. 2 	of 1907 	to be degrading 	to anybody 	coming under it, 	much more so for 	soldiers who 	have been privileged to wear His Majesty’s uniform, and who have bled for their Sovereign. Your 	Petitioners are bound 	by a solemn oath: 
  not 	to accept 	the above-mentioned 	Act, and 	to secure 	its repeal;  never 	to give 	their digit-impressions 	in connection 	with their 	identification, 	irrespective of what 	other members of 	the Indian 	community may 	choose to do. 
    Your 			Petitioners, in 			obedience to 			the advice 			given by the 			then Commissioner 			of Police 			and other 			high officials, and 			on being 			told that the Act was 			to be repealed, 			underwent voluntary registration 			merely for 			the sake of peace. 			Further than this your 			Petitioners are 			unable to 			go. They consider 			that, by showing 			an unmanly 			attitude and by 			accepting degradation 			in order 			that they might 			be able 			to live 			in the 			Colony, they would be 			extremely unsoldier-like.  Your 			Petitioners venture to 			submit that 			their uniform and 			their discharges 			should be 			a sufficient 			passport in 			any part of the 			British Empire, and 			should constitute 			their complete identification.  Your 			Petitioners do 			not understand legal 			subtleties and legal 			quibbles. They 			have not 			studied the 			Asiatic Act. They  are 			helpless, except when 			they are 			called upon to fight 			for their Sovereign. 			They do 			not understand 			English, but what 			little they 			have been able to 			gather about the 			Asiatic Act 			is sufficient 			to make 			them condemn 			the measure.  Your 			Petitioners, therefore, 			humbly pray 			that, in consonance 			with the assurance 			given, the Asiatic 			Act be 			repealed, and 			that they be not called upon to submit to any degradation in the way   
 
 of registration or otherwise. But, should His Majesty’s Government be unable to secure such relief, they would repeat their prayer that they be shot by Generals Botha and Smuts on one of the battle-fields of South Africa, where they have been under fire, whilst serving their King-Emperor and the British Empire. And your Petitioners will ever pray, etc., etc.

 "
80,"September 15, 1908",TRIAL OF V. M. BAGAS AND OTHERS,"
        
 [PRETORIA,
 September 15, 1908] Messrs Vally Mahomed Bagas, Ismail Juma, L. Vallabhdas, and Ismail Essopjee Adia appeared before Major Dixon at Pretoria, on the 15th instant, charged
with a contravention of the Borough bye-laws in that they traded without a grocer’s
 licence. Mr. Weavind prosecuted on behalf of the Municipality of Pretoria, and Messrs Gandhi and Lichtenstein defended.
 Mr. Ismail Juma’s case was first called. Mr. Gandhi took exception to the summons before pleading, that it disclosed no offence under Ordinance 58 of 1903, and that the Ordinance did not provide for the framing of a bye-law in regard to a general grocer’s licence. The Magistrate overruled the objection. The plea was “not guilty”. Mr. Thomas, the Licensing Officer, gave formal evidence as to the accused having carried on the business of a grocer. Mr. Gandhi did not call any evidence on behalf of the defence, stating that he rested his case on the legal objection raised. The accused was found guilty and fined 5s or three days’ imprisonment with hard labour. Mr. Ismail Juma elected to go to gaol.
 Mr. Vally Mahomed Bagas, who is Chairman of the Pretoria branch of the British Indian Association, was next tried. Mr. Bagas pleaded “not guilty”. After evidence was given by Mr. Thomas, the Licensing Officer, Mr. Bagas gave evidence to the effect that he held a general dealer’s licence for the whole year and that he had even tendered the fee for a grocer’s licence, but it had been refused, as he had declined   to give his thumb-impression. The Magistrate awarded the same penalty. There were two charges against Mr. Bagas in respect of two stores, the penalty in each case being the same. He, too, cheerfully went to gaol.
 Mess Ismail Adia and L. Vallabhdas were also similarly tried, punished, and went to gaol.
 A Chinese trader was called, but he did not appear, and, as he was bailed out, his bail was estreated to the extent of £ 1.

 ESSOP MIA
 Mr. Essop Mia has resigned, and a vote of thanks for his services was passed at the mass meeting.libtech_295_footnotelibtech_296_footnoteThe appreciation of his services will grow with time. He assumed the captainship of the Indians’ ship at a critical juncture. It was to help in the implementation of the gaol resolutionlibtech_297_footnotelibtech_298_footnotethat he accepted the chairmanship. No one then was in a position to say what the Indian community would do. Much appeared then to depend on the Chairman’s courage. Mr. Essop Mia evinced the requisite courage for conducting the affairs. He curtailed his business last year in order to join battle against the Government. This year he suffered an assault.libtech_299_footnotelibtech_300_footnoteHe kept himself ever in   readiness  for gaol. He took to hawking, with two baskets hanging from his shoulders like a gold neck-wear or a garland of flowers. It is difficult adequately to realize how his action aroused the community’s enthusiasm. Through his courage, Mr. Essop Mia has enabled the community to arrive at a stage where the fulfilment of its pledge has become certain. What now remains to be done is very important— something that the Indian community cannot afford to ignore and which calls for massive resistance.
 But one cannot blame Mr. Essop Mia for leaving the ship at this critical moment. Thrice he put off his plans for a pilgrimage in order to attend to three great tasks—the mosque, the madrasah and the campaign against the Government. He has now the right to leave. If other Indian chairmen can do as much as Mr. Essop Mia, the community’s success is assured.
 AHMED MAHOMED CACHALIA
 
 Everyone hopes that Mr. Cachalia will prove Mr. Essop Mia’s equal. He was not at all disposed to accept the chairmanship. The office has been thrust upon him, so to say. To me at least it appeared
 
 
 that everyone was agreed that no one but Mr. Cachalia should succeed Mr. Essop Mia.
 Mr. Cachalia had been to gaol. I still seem to hear his words of July 31, 1907: “I will go to gaol,” he had said, “Should they cut my throat for it, I will still not submit to the obnoxious law.” He has been as good as his word. He has already been to gaol. He has always showed himself willing for work. He is extremely popular. He has unhesitatingly accepted financial ruin for himself. Mr. Cachalia is therefore assuming the chairmanship in propitious circumstances.
 But the Indian ship is caught in a storm still at its fiercest. Nearer the coast, the storm poses a greater danger to the ship than in mid- ocean. Even if the voyage ahead is only a short one, the task is onerous. Maybe the sailors are tired. Columbus’s mariners mutinied as he was about to reach America. But his courage rallied them, and he succeeded in discovering America. Similar is the case with the Indian ship. Though we are approaching our destination, the number of reefs is increasing. It requires a strong captain to steer the ship clear of these. I believe Mr. Cachalia will prove strong enough.
 The chairman ought to be the best member of the community. For the community will be judged by his worth. Moreover,  as chairman, he has to lead the satyagraha campaign and he must therefore remain truth-ful, repose trust in God and have courage till his dying moment. He must be prepared to sacrifice money, property and life in the service of the community and he must be entirely honest, fearless, pure, courteous and modest; these are the qualities which the chairman of the Indian community must have. Then alone can satyagraha blossom forth into perfect beauty and achieve success that will evoke the admiration of all the world.
 I for one pray to Khuda-Ishwar to endow Mr. Cachalia with all these virtues, and I advise all Indians to offer the same prayer.
 SAME OLD NEWS
 There has been news which I could not report earlier owing to heavy pressure of work. I mention here whatever I have been able to discover on looking into my papers.
 Mr. Ismail Moosa Gin and Mr. Essop Amod of Kanam were fined in Heidelberg; if the fines were not paid, their goods were to be auctioned. Mr. Gin has paid the fine, Mr. Essop Amod has not. He has informed the Government that it may sell his goods if it so desires. His goods have not, however, been auctioned yet.
 In Vereeniging, Mr. Ibrahim Ismail’s goods as also those of Mr. Patel have been auctioned. Here again, a large quantity of goods was
 auctioned. Such is the confusion that prevails. At one place no one bothers much,libtech_301_footnoteand at another goods are auctioned. It all sounds like the story of the crazy king and the city which he ruled so capriciously.libtech_302_footnote
 KRUGERSDORP INDIANS
 The Krugersdorp affairlibtech_303_footnotelibtech_304_footnoteis over. The trial took place on Friday. After the cases of Mr. Kazi and Mr. Pandor, the Public Prosecutor did not have the courage to proceed with the rest and therefore withdrew them. The cases of Mr. Kazi and Mr. Pandor took two hours. After hearing their depositions, the Magistrate remarked that the charge was without substance and accordingly found them “not guilty”. Mr. Kazi deposed in English. The cases over, a meeting was held at Mr. Chhotabhai’s, where Mr. Gandhi explainedlibtech_305_footnotelibtech_306_footnotethe position regarding the campaign. An understanding has now been reached among  all Indians. Mr. Dadlani entertained Mr. Gandhi at a luncheon. Twenty- five Indians were invited on the occasion.
 KONKAN AND KANAM
 On Thursday, as the mass meeting was drawing to a close, it was learnt that a skirmish was in progress outside, at which Mr. Polak rushed to the spot. Mr. Abdool Gani also left with him. They saw a fight going on with much cudgel-play and pelting of stones. Thanks to intervention by Mr. Polak, Mr. Gani and others, there were fewer injuries. Mr. Polak was about to be beaten up in the confusion that ensued. But two Parsee gentlemen, Mr. Sorabji and Mr. Nogama, interposed themselves so that they took the blows. Sorabji narrowly escaped being hurt in the eye, but was severely injured on the  forehead. Two Konkanis were also seriously injured and  two Kanamias sustained injuries. Mr. Polak received a slight injury on the wrist. It was a mere altercation among youth over a trifling matter which led to all this.
 RECONCILIATION
 A meeting of the leaders of the two communities was held at Hajee Habib’s on Sunday with a view to reconciliation. Mr. Gandhi was asked to take the chair. Mr. Hajee Habib, the Moulvi Saheb, Mr. Cachalia, Mr. Abdool Gani, Mr. Bhaijee, Mr. Shahabuddin and others
 
 spoke on the occasion and the leaders of both the communities signed the following agreement.
 DOCUMENT1libtech_307_footnote
 We, the leaders of the Konkani and Kanamia communities, express our regret in writing, with God as witness, at the quarrel that took place among some young men of the  two  communities, and tender our apologies to, and seek to be  forgiven by, one another. We bind ourselves to restrain  the young men of our respective communities and hold ourselves responsible for them. We suggest that the young men report the matter to us if any of them is insulted rather than fight among themselves.
 I attach great importance to this document. Since the leaders know their responsibilities, some good is bound to accrue to someone in the end. It behoves the young men to see that they do not bicker among themselves and thus honour their leaders’ pledge. If the Pathans, Konka-nis and Kanamias think themselves to be brave soldiers, their duty is to defend the Indian community and use their strength for that purpose. The leaders must remember that this document was signed with God as wit-ness, so that they bear a heavy responsibility. The young must always re-member not to enter into quarrels. I hope that when a Kanamia and a Konkani meet next, each will want to be the first to salute the other. When the meeting was over, Mr. Hajee Habib treated all of them to tea and biscuits and Mr. Osman Ahmed sang a few songs about the reconciliation.
 MASS MEETING
 A detailed report of the mass meeting is available elsewhere, but I shall only report the Abdool Gani episodelibtech_308_footnotelibtech_309_footnotelibtech_310_footnotehere. It has been proved that he did give the thumb-impression. He manifested his repentance by apologizing at the meeting. He said that he had not at all wanted to give his thumb-impression, but being in a hurry to get away, he had given it out of sheer nervousness. He promised not to repeat his mistake and to remain firm in his resistance while urging others to do likewise. In view of Mr. Abdool Gani’s action, no one will now have anything more to say about the matter. I hope he will now take a leading part in carrying the campaign forward and thus serve the community.
 
 ALI ESSOP
 [He] was tried today. He was charged with being found without a register. Mr. Polak appeared in this case. Mr. Essop has received notice to leave the country within seven days.
 MULJIBHAI P ATEL
 As Mr. Patel was to be released on Friday, a number of men had gone to the gaol to receive  him.  But  it  soon  became  known that Mr. Patel was to be deported. He was taken from Jeppe station, and brought  to Charlestown on  Saturday.  Many  Indians  were present at Germiston to see him. Mr. Patel is doing well and is full of courage. He will re-enter shortly. He is prepared for further privations that may be in store for him. The police treated him well.
 SORABJI S HAPURJI
 Acting with great courage, Mr. Sorabji Shapurji left Johannesburg today by the morning train for Volksrust to undergo the sentence of imprisonment. Even at the mass meeting he had declared that he was prepared for imprisonment, however  long  it might be. His only regret was that the Association had not permitted him to court arrest earlier than the Natal businessmen, though he should have been allowed to do this as of right. Mr. Cachalia, Mr. Aswat, Mr. Vyas, Mr. Polak, Mr. Jivanji, Mr. Naidoo, Mr. Gandhi and others were present to see him off.
 Mr. Ebrahim Osman arrived here on Saturday. Mr. Cachalia and others went to receive him. He will be Mr. Cachalia’s guest.
 NATAL BUSINESSMEN AS P RISONERS
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed and the other leaders in gaol have surpassed all expectations. The Government wants to test them to the utmost. They are made to do hard work. They are brought out on the roads and made to break stones; they do this with zest. They say in a message that, until a settlement is reached, they will remain in gaol and put up with any suffering. I am not at all sorry that they have been given hard work to do. It is only when we suffer that we develop real worth. It is a soldier’s duty to accept hardships. In any case that is the only lesson the soldier of satyagraha has to learn. He must constantly remind himself of it. If one is sincerely devoted to one’s cause, one can enjoy even stone-breaking.
 RUSTOMJEE’S LETTER
 After he was sentenced, Mr. Rustomjee sent the following letter: Four of us have been sentenced today to three months. We
 are glad of this. Please ask everyone to have courage. Let no one have fear. Please declare in the open meeting that, if our brethren want to show their appreciation of our sense of duty, they should endeavour to raise a large fund.
 HOW TO ENSURE EARLY RELEASE OF [NATAL] BUSINESSMEN
This question is on everyone’s mind. The answer is easy.
  No 	one should 	utilize the licence 	[that he 	may already 	possess] to 	carry on trade. No 	one should 	take out a licence. Everyone 	should go to gaol 	when an opportunity 	presents itself.  Those 	Natal Indians who, according to 	our belief, 	have the right 	[to settle 	in the Colony] 	should cross over.  Incoming 	  Indians   should 	  in    no 	  case   give   their	thumb- 	impressions. One 	should disregard the 	auctioning of 	one’s goods. 
 QUESTIONS OF P RESTIGE
 I have noticed that some of those who enter the Transvaal to join the campaign are sensitive about how they are received. This is not the time to think much of one’s status. Every Indian should put away his self-importance and come in as a servant of India. There is no time to arrange elaborate receptions. Those who are busy [with the cause] have no time to spare. When Sorabji [re-]entered the Colony, he certainly deserved to be shown every regard. But no one had the time for all that. Gaol-going has now become commonplace among us. If we are all servants [in the same cause], who is to honour whom? Such is our predicament today and well may it remain so for ever.
 The homage we do to sincere and good men is in fact somewhat humiliating to the community as a whole—it only goes to show that there are so few of them that we shower honours on the ones that we have. Always a higher price is charged for a scarce commodity. If a time should come when the entire community is composed of good men, it would certainly be respected by the world at large, though it might not fete any of them in public. The British go crazy over a person who is strong. This may mean either of two things: they are either losing their true strength, or they admire sheer physical strength.
 Duty, then, requires every Indian to be a good, truthful, patient and patriotic servant of his motherland. If this happens, there will be no cause for anyone to take offence. It will not even occur to anyone that he has not been treated with respect. One’s worth consists entirely
 in one’s spending one’s days in doing good, content with whatever one may get at any given moment and whatever it pleases the Creator to bestow on one.
 Tuesday [September 15, 1908]
 MISUNDERSTANDING
 Mr. Mahomed Khan’s leaving Mr. Gandhi’s office has been construed by some to mean that he has grown tired of  honorary public work. This is not true. Mr. Mahomed Khan did offer his services free, and he need not have. An opportunity for earning a decent livelihood came his way, and he left on Mr. Gandhi’s advice.libtech_311_footnoteMr. Dorasamy’s offer of free work was accepted, for in any case he was not doing anything else. It is of course necessary for Indians to have an honest means of livelihood and make some money. Not everyone can give up his job and become a volunteer. Mr. Dorasamy has other sources from which to meet his daily needs, and that is how he is in a position to help the Association.
 COMMITTEE MEETING
 A meeting of the Committee of the British Indian Association was held on Wednesday the 9th, when, in the absence of Mr. Essop Mia, Mr. Ibrahim Coovadia took the chair. Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir, Mr. Fancy, Mr. Karodia, Mr. Omarji, Mr. Latchhiram, Mr. V. G. Maharaj and others were present. Since Mr. Gandhi has all but closed down his office and Mr. Polak is engaged wholly in public work, it has been resolved that the Association should bear his [Polak’s] expenses and pay the rent for the office from August onwards.libtech_312_footnoteThis will, for the time being, involve a further expenditure of £ 35 monthly which is exclusive of the expenditure on the typist, etc. Mr. Gandhi’s own expenses are paid by Mr. Kallenbach. Mr. Gandhi also stays with him.
 AHMED ESSOP DAWAD
 Mr. Ahmed Essop Dawad was charged some months ago with haw-king without a licence. He had left the Court [for a while] when his name was called out, with the result that the Magistrate cancelled his bail. Mr. Ahmed turned up later. But the Magistrate did not revise his order about the bail since he had no authority to do so. A petition was therefore sub-mitted to the Attorney- General. It was ordered that the bail money be returned, and the case proceeded with. It was heard
 
“Johannesburg Letter”, 7-9-1908.
 on Saturday (the 12th). But Mr. Cross dismissed the case on the ground that Mr. Ahmed had been hawking without having taken out a licence, whereas the charge against him was that he had failed to produce his licence on demand. The charge could not therefore be sustained. There is nothing remarkable about this case. The only fact to be noted is that Mr. Ahmed Dawad was anxious to be imprisoned. He tried, as we have shown above, to go to gaol, but did not succeed.
 PRETORIA CASES
 The municipality has launched prosecutions against Mr. Vally Mahomed Bagas, Mr. Ismail Adia, Mr. Ismail Juma, Mr. Lalshah Vallabhdas alias Mangalbhai Patel and a Chinese for trading as grocers  without  licences.  Their  caseslibtech_313_footnotelibtech_314_footnoteare  to  be  heard  today.  Mr. Gandhi has gone to Pretoria in connection with these cases. Many of them hold a general dealer’s licence valid for the whole year. But the municipality insists on their taking out the grocer’s licences in addition. Most of them did have these licences for the preceding six- month period, but they did not renew them as they did not want to give their thumb-impressions. An objection will be raised in this case to the effect that the municipality has no right at all to insist on a grocer’s licence; but it has the right to insist on a licence of a different kind. There is, however, no provision for this as yet in its bye-laws. It this argument is correct, the case must fail. Mr. Valli Mahomed has received two summonses as he owns two stores.
 Wednesday [September 16, 1908] The Pretoria Indians’ case was heard in Major Dixon’s Court.
Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Lichtenstein were present [as defence counsel].
 The above-mentioned argument was put forward. That set the Magistrate thinking, but he eventually ruled that the municipality did have the right to insist on a grocer’s licence. Mr. Ismail Juma’s case was then the first to be heard. The objection had softened the Magistrate’s attitude. Also, the municipal advocate was not very competent. The Indians were not therefore called in for evidence. As a result, the Magistrate imposed a fine of 5s, or three days’ hard labour. Mr. Ismail Juma readily accepted the sentence and went to gaol. Then the Court took up the two cases against Valli Mahomed.  The judgement in these cases was the same as in the first. Then it was Mr. Adia’s turn, and he was followed by Mr. Lalshah Vallabhdas alias Mangalbhai Patel. All of them were awarded the same sentence, and went to gaol smiling. They were in fact sentenced to only a day’s imprisonment. They went [to gaol] on Tuesday at 4 p.m., so that that
 
 day need not be counted. They will be in gaol all Wednesday and will be released on Thursday morning.
 Though these persons have welcomed gaol, it is being considered whether an appeal should not be preferred on the basis of the objection [raised by the defence counsel]. For something may come out of it. If it is held that grocer’s licences have to be taken out, people can avoid taking them out for some time. If that is done, two purposes will have been served. People will have the advantage of going to gaol, and at the same time a technical excuse will have been provided by the law which can be exploited for a time. Mr. Valli Mahomed is the chairman in Pretoria. Though  his term of imprisonment is a negligible one, a chairman going to gaol is no small matter. I congratulate Mr. Valli Mahomed and others in Pretoria on this.
 The reader must have noted that it is for the second time that Mr. Ismail Juma has gone to gaol. And it was only recently that Mr. Adia was fined £1 and his goods were auctioned.
 The only regret is that, while these persons went to gaol, there were other Indians who lost their nerve when the summonses were served on them.libtech_315_footnotelibtech_316_footnoteThey were afraid that their goods might be auctioned and therefore hastened to take out licences by giving thumb- impressions. It is said that there were 20 such persons. It is incidents of this kind that prolong the struggle. If all the Indians were courageous, it would be possible for us to secure the release of the Natal businessmen within a few days. When, again, shops were closed in Pretoria [as a mark of respect] for them, there were a few who did not join. This is tantamount to selfishness and most reprehensible. When persons who are regarded as the pillars of the Indian community went to gaol, why is it that some Indians could not close their shops for a day? I must say that we have a great many things to learn yet.
 In Krugersdorp, two Madrasi washermen, Mr. Sangaran and Mr. Aicut, were arrested for carrying on their occupation without licences. They were tried, and the Magistrate imposed a fine of £1 each or three days’ imprisonment. They preferred gaol. No one appeared in their defence. They went to gaol on their own.
 EBRAHIM OSMAN
 [He] has gone to Piet Retief where he owns a store, and  expressed his readiness for arrest.
 
 
 NATAL PRISONERS’ MESSAGE
 Mr. Polak met Mr. Dawad Mahomed and others [in gaol] on Tuesday. They are all doing well. Since they did not have gaol uniforms which would fit Mr. Dawad Mahomed and Mr. Rustomjee, new uniforms are being specially made for them. The rest  are  assigned work. All of them are in high spirits and full of courage. They have expressed the hope that all of us outside would strive hard.

83,"September 	16, 1908",LETTER TO DIRECTOR OF PRISONSlibtech_317_footnote,"
  September 	16, 1908  Mr. 	Gandhi, interviewed by 	Reuter’s representative 	today, said that the 	Indians were 	prepared to 	accept an 	immigration law 	which should provide for 	an education 	test in 	a European 	language, and they were 	prepared to 	leave the 	severity of 	the test 	 to the discretion of General Smuts. But once an Indian entered the Colony, he must  enjoy 	legal equality. This 	implies the 	repeal of 	1907 Act. Mr. Gandhi 	said that the 	Indians denied that they were raising any fresh point in connection with education.  India, 	25-9-1908             [JOHANNESBURG,]  September 	17, 1908  THE 	DIRECTOR 	OF PRISONS 	PRETORIA SIR,  	I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 667 	of the 16th instant. My Association deeply regrets the fact that the 	point raised by it is still being missed.  	My Association is aware, and admits, that, medically, mealie pap is 	a perfectly healthy diet, but the point raised by my Association is 	that it is not a diet suited to the habits of even poor-class 	Indians. Mealie pap is not the national diet of Indians. I have no 	doubt you are    
 aware that, although it is medically suitable, bread is always added to mealie pap issued to European prisoners. Bread is certainly, from a medical standpoint, not more necessary for Europeans than  for Indians. You are also aware that mealies are given to the Native prisoners for the midday meal. They are also, medically, a proper diet, and yet, with the knowledge that the Committee must have had at its disposal, mealies were replaced by rice for Indian prisoners in respect of the midday meal. The reason that actuated the Committee that framed the diet scale in prescribing rice instead of mealies for the midday meal for Indian prisoners is also the reason why my Association asks for a substitute for mealie pap for the morning meal.
 If, hitherto, there has been no complaint made against the diet scale for Indian prisoners, the reason is that there have been very few Indian prisoners; but, on the present occasion, a complaint is justified, not only because the Transvaal prisons are crowded with Indians, but also because these Indians are not, strictly speaking, criminals, and belong, in the opinion of my Association, to the highest class among the Indian community in South Africa.
 If the repeated representations of my Association have remained unheeded, the only conclusion the Indian community can come to is that the reasonable request of my Association is refused out of political considerations, and with a view to starve  the  Indian community into submission to an Act which is resented by it.
 I venture to hope, therefore, that you will be pleased to remove any such suspicion by granting the relief requested.

               [JOHANNESBURG,] 
   TO  THE 	EDITOR THESTAR SIR, September 	17, 1908 
  	You will perhaps allow me to state that your  persistent 	misrepresentation of the Indian standpoint appears now to be wilful 	rather than unconscious. You state that I am “willing to accept 	any education test, however severe, provided it is applied 	impartially to Europeans and Asiatics”. This is the exact reverse 	of what I have stated all along. My contention is that there should 	be a general education test in law, but that, in practice, it may be 	administered not impartially but differentially. The law gives the 	Minister  full discretion, to be used by him as he chooses. If he 	does not possess the discretion, Indians are quite willing that the 	discretion be given.libtech_319_footnoteThis 	statement I have made before the public and to your representatives 	not once but very often. Nor, as you have stated in a previous 	leaderette, is there any question of a subterfuge. Administrative 	inequality must always exist so long as people who are      that 	we have wilfully misrepresented either Mr. Gandhi or his 	compatriots. …Our reply to the foregoing is that no regulation or 	ministerial decree can override the express terms of an Act of 	Parliament. Laws are made to be enforced. If the Government.…failed 	to enforce the provisions in this case,…it would be lending itself 	to a species of dishonesty unworthy of statesmen.” To this 	Gandhiji sent a rejoinder; vide 	“Letter to The 	Star”, 18-9-1908. 
 not of the same grade live under the same flag. All I claim is that the law should be no respecter of persons, especially with regard to educated Indians. You cite the authority of The Times, but, if you will pardon me saying so, The Times merely trumpets what has  been  passed on to it by or on behalf of General Smuts. The Times is not, at present, in possession of the full facts of the case.
 I emphatically deny that a new question is now being raised by my countrymen. The following briefly are the facts: Before the war, the immigration of Indians was free. After the conclusion of peace, immigration generally was regulated under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, under which new educated Asiatics were allowed to enter the country. The Asiatic Act of 1907 simply provided for registration of those who were entitled to reside in the country, but, according to the admission made by General Smuts, did not regulate immigration. The Immigrants’ Restriction Act replaced the Peace Preservation Ordinance, and laid down a general education test. The Asiatic [Registration] Act was then dishonestly, without even mentioning it, brought in to defraud Indians of their just rights, under sub-section 4 of section 2; but, as Indians have never accepted the Asiatic Act and have always steadily, persistently, and amid untold suffering,  demanded its repeal, how can they be charged with having brought in a new point?
 It was General Smuts who, in complete breach of his promise when the time came for him to repeal the Act, offered repeal on four conditionslibtech_320_footnote, three of which he has, yielding to the force of passive resistance, and finding his administration of the law paralyzed, withdrawn. The fourthlibtech_321_footnotehe does not withdraw, and, until that is granted, in the estimation of British Indians and other Asiatics, he must stand guilty of the charge of dishonesty.
 You and, I am sorry to say, the Progressive leaders, who profess to have Imperial interests at heart, and who profess to lead the party of progress, are allied on the side of dishonesty. May I draw a parallel? With reference to the Vereeniging Treaty, General Botha interpreted the word “native” to include Asiatics. Lord Milner and Sir Richard Solomon repudiated it, but they accepted the interpretation that General Botha put upon it, and Asiatics are today debarred from the municipal franchise because of such interpretation.libtech_322_footnotelibtech_323_footnoteGeneral  Botha, again, said that his people were promised immediate self-government by Lord Kitchener. In order that British honour might remain
 
 unstained, in this instance also his understanding of the promise was accepted by the Imperial Government. Is British honour or Colonial honour to be measured differently in connection with the repeal of the Asiatic Act and British Indians?"

He had 	been anxious 	to see 	his son the previous day. 	When he approached 	the official 	concerned for information 	about him, he 	told Mr. Gandhi 	that he 	had heard nothing 	till then, and 	promised to 	inform him 	the following morning as 	to what the 	authorities proposed to 	do [with 	his son]. 	When Mr. Gandhi 	presented himself at the 	gaol [the next day], he 	was informed that Mr. Harilal had been taken away [under escort] at seven o’clock.  Mr. 	Gandhi said that, if the Government had wanted him [Harilal Gandhi] 	to promise that there would be no demonstration, he would have done 	so as he had, indeed, several times in the past. Mr. Gandhi junior 	was in the train at Jeppe Station, but the carriage windows were 	shut. They were also kept shut at Germiston. People repeatedly 	remarked on this—which malicious onlookers found greatly 	interesting. Mr. Gandhi has telegraphed to his son to re-enter the 	Colony immediately.libtech_325_footnoteHe will receive the 	telegram at the border. [From 	Gujarati]  Indian 	Opinion, 19-9-1908             [JOHANNESBURG,]  September 	18, 1908  THE 	DIRECTOR 	OF PRISONS 	PRETORIA SIR,  	I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram No. 	456 in connection with the diet scale for Indian prisoners. My 	Association will be obliged if you will kindly let me have a copy of     
 the authorized scale for short and long sentence Indian and other prisoners.
 Further, I beg to draw your attention to the fact that I was myself in the Pretoria gaol in connection with the movement, and ghee was then allowed without any special request of the prisoners. I noticed, too, that ghee was allowed to Indian prisoners whom we found at the Pretoria gaol. The Johannesburg prisoners also state that they were allowed ghee from the very commencement, and that Indian prisoners who were already at the Johannesburg gaol when prosecutions under the Asiatic Act commenced were all allowed ghee. One  of the prisoners states that he actually read the printed scale,  which mentioned 4 oz. of rice and 1 oz. of ghee in place of crushed mealies and fat. My Association also states that [the] diet scale that was printed was so rigorously adhered to by the Gaol authorities at Johannesburg that the Chinese prisoners were given crushed mealies and fat, because they were not included in the rice scale that was fixed for Indian prisoners.libtech_326_footnotelibtech_327_footnoteMy  Association  will,  therefore,  be   obliged   if   you   will kindly inquire and authorize the necessary relief.
 I once more draw your attention to the fact that no greater offence can be offered to a Mahomedan or a vegetarian Hindu than to introduce animal fat into his food. I beg, further, to add that even the prisoners who were discharged lately from the Johannesburg gaol informed my Association that they received 1 oz. of ghee with their ration of rice.

         TO THE 	EDITOR THE 	STAR SIR,  JOHANNESBURG, September 	18, 1908 
  	I am delighted that you emphatically repudiate my suggestion that 	you may have wilfully misrepresented me. Your repudiation fills me 	with hope that I may yet convince you of the justice of the Indian 	demand. I assume now that you would not mind an open door for highly 	educated Indians. If so, the question is not of “whether”, but 	of “how”.  	You reject my solution to be “a species of dishonesty unworthy of 	statesmen”. And yet it has been resorted to by statesmen all over 	the world. The Peace Preservation Ordinance gave absolute discretion 	to the Governor as to the issue of permits. White British subjects 	received them for the asking; other Europeans with little 	difficulty, but not with the same facility; British Indians after 	the greatest difficulty. The Governor went so far as to establish a 	separate departmentlibtech_329_footnotelibtech_330_footnotefor administering the same Ordinance for Indians. This 	was unfair, but not dishonest, because it was openly done. The 	Governor had the discretion and he chose to use it in this very 	partial manner, as he said, in the interests of the predominant 	race. Indians would not have cavilled at the differential 	administration, if the Department at one time had not been tainted 	with corruption and always most niggardly regarding the claims of 	bona fide refugees.  	You have charged General Smuts with having used his discretion 	unfairly as to filling the vacancies in the Civil Service with 	Boers, but whether it is statesmanlike or not will depend upon 	results.  	In Natal, the Immigration Officer has a discretion as to the 	education test. I will take my oath that Europeans as a rule are not 	even examined. Indians, as a rule, are examined and that, too, 	severely.     
 A Mr. Abdulla Brownelibtech_331_footnote, an Irishman, was subjected to the test some years ago in Natal, because he wore the fez, whilst his other white fellow-passengers were not touched. Subsequently, the late Mr. Escombe and Mr. Browne had a hearty laugh over it. Mr. Browne felt the ludicrous position, but did not consider the examination to be dishonest.
 The same thing is, today, done at the Cape.
 The fact is that legal inequality would be an insult to the race. Administrative difference would be a concession to prejudice, and Indian acceptance of it would be a graceful and, shall I say, statesmanlike recog-nition of such prejudice, as also of the fact that, if we want to live in this country, we must submit to the predominance of the European races.
 In any case, if you agree that a handful of educated Asiatics may safely be allowed to enter without molestation, surely  the combined wisdom of the Government and the Progressive Party cannot fail to find a solution that will be acceptable to both Europeans and Indians and end a situation which cannot be viewed with  unconcern by any lover of the Empire.

A weak chairman 	would have meant utter ruination and disaster to the Indian 	community. Mr. Essop Mia proved strong and unshakable. He 	practically wound up his business last year to fight the powers of 	darkness represented by the local Government. He postponed for the 	third time his pilgrimage to Mecca. He lost his wife; but he would 	not withdraw his hand from the helm. The whole world knows that he 	suffered grievous bodily harm at the hands of a countryman  for  the 	 cause  of  truth.libtech_334_footnotelibtech_335_footnoteAnd,  by  the   compromise   of      
 January last and by the introduction of the new Registration Act, he has shown what pluck and firm faith in one’s cause can do. Mr. Essop Mia deserves the thanks of the Indians not only of the Transvaal but of South Africa. His mantle has fallen on worthy shoulders. Mr. Cachalia is a seasoned soldier in Indian ranks. He has suffered imprisonment for the cause. He has worked whole-heartedly and was always an able lieutenant to Mr. Essop Mia. By universal acknowledgement, he is the best man to succeed Mr. Mia. Let us hope that he will fulfil the expectations of the community. His is a very difficult task. The Indian ship is still in troubled waters. And he will require all the energy, patience and calmness that may be in him, and all the support from the rank and file that he can command.

 "
89,,SITUATION IN NATAL,"
        
 Natal Indians should act with due deliberation. Petitions and meetings will avail nothing. They must be backed up by sanctions.
 The Newcastle licence case is noteworthy. As it served to show, municipalities are authorized to grant [only] certain kinds of licences.libtech_336_footnoteOther [categories of] licences can be granted under the Act [18] of 1897.libtech_337_footnoteBut one can argue that this Act does not extend the powers of the municipalities. That is to say, they are limited. If this is true, there are certain advantages that we can derive from it.
 Since this is the state of affairs, the Natal  Government has drafted a new Bill which will, in consequence, nullify [the advantages] resulting from the Newcastle case. It is necessary staunchly to oppose this. The Natal Parliament will of course throw [any] petition [which we send] into the waste-paper basket. The Imperial Government will also not take any notice of it, which means that the time has arrived when, even if we win on the legal front, Parliament may neutralize our victory.libtech_338_footnote
 There is only one way out of this: we must rely on our own strength and fight. That strength is the strength of satyagraha. Natal traders should trade without licences.

91,"September 	19, 1908",LETTER TO DIRECTOR OF PRISONS,"
             [JOHANNESBURG,]  September 	19, 1908  THE 	DIRECTOR 	OF PRISONS 	PRETORIA SIR,  	My Association has received a letter in Gujarati from a British 	Indian named Syed Ali, who has just undergone imprisonment at 	Boksburg. I give below a free translation of the material portion of 	the letter. It is dated the 17th instant, and is written from 	Springs:  	I write the following, God between us. On the 19th day of August, 	1908, I was sentenced by the Magistrate to pay a fine of 10[s] or 	suffer imprisonment for seven days with hard labour for    
 trading without a licence. I accepted gaol. When I was admitted, a Kaffir came to me and asked me to strip myself naked. I did so. I was then made to walk, in that condition, barefoot, some distance. I was then kept, together with Kaffirs, in cold water, for twentyfive minutes.  I was then taken out and taken to an office. I was then given some clothes to wear, but I did not get any sandals. I, therefore, asked the gaoler for some. At first, he said ‘no’, and then he gave me torn sandals. I asked for socks. and he used abusive language (untranslateable). I asked again, and he said ‘Look here, I will sjamboklibtech_340_footnotelibtech_341_footnotelibtech_342_footnoteyou.’ I was then frightened and had   I  spoken  again,  he would certainly have struck me.
 On the 20th August, the work given to me was that of carrying and emptying closet buckets. I complained to the gaoler about this work, and I received a kick and slaps. I still persisted in my complaint, and told him that I would be glad to  break stones  but  would  like to be relieved from the work of carrying and emptying these buckets.  I was then kicked again. I became helpless and I had to carry those buckets.
 On the 22nd August, Saturday, I was again kept in cold water for nearly half an hour. It was extremely cold. I was shivering. God knows how cold it was. I them became, feverish. My chest became bad. On the 25th, I was discharged. The gaoler, on discharging, said ‘Your may come again, if you wish to die’ and I retorted, ‘All right, you may kill me if you can.’ I then returned to Springs by the 11 o’clock train. And ever since I have been ill, and I have been discharging blood from the chest, and am under medical advice….
 I was treated worse than Kaffir prisoners. Happily, I was the only Indian. I thank God that I was spared. All my book-debts have become bad, but I do not care. I hope the community will be able to preserve its self-respect.
 My Association does not know how far the above statement is true, but, on the face of it, in my humble opinion, it calls for a thorough investigation, which I have no doubt you will make. In the meanwhile, I venture to inform the Government through you that, assuming the truth of the above statement, the advice given by my Association is, despite all difficulties, to continue to suffer for what it believes to be a principle.
 
 I may add that the correspondent, as his name implies, is a direct descendant of the Prophet, and I need hardly comment upon the resentment that would be bitterly felt by Mahomedans, when they understand that such a person has been called upon to perform the dirtiest work at the Boksburg gaol.

               JOHANNESBURG, 
    WILLIAM 	HOSKEN, 	ESQ., 	M.L.A.libtech_343_footnoteJOHANNESBURG DEAR 	SIR, September 	19, 1908 
  	We, the undersigned, are deeply grateful to you for the kindly 	interest you, as a lover of the Empire and a Christian gentleman, 	take in the present bitter struggle that Asiatics are engaged in.  	You have told us, at the meeting called by you at your office to- 	day, and attended by Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Pollock, and ourselves, 	that General Smuts genuinely regrets the persecution which the 	Asiatic communities, the majority of whom are British subjects, are 	undergoing. We appreciate this sentiment. You also said that General 	Smuts thinks that there would be no insuperable difficulty in 	meeting our request. We, therefore, beg to state as follows:  	A promise should be given by General Smuts and the leader of the  	Progressive  Oppositionlibtech_344_footnotethat   the   Asiatic  Act   will  be   repealed during 	the next session of Parliament, and that the status of highly 	educated Indians will be safeguarded in terms of the request made by 	the British Indian Association.  	As to the latter question, in order to show our bona fides, we 	would be quite satisfied with the entry, per year, of, say, six such 	Indians. The great point, therefore, is that they should be able to 	enter under the general education test. There should be no legal 	distinction.     
 We do not mind an administration of the law such that only the above number can enter. Precedent for such administration is not wanting. The Cape and Natal are doing so at present. In our opinion, such discretion is given under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act, but if General Smuts holds otherwise, we have no objection to the Act being so amended as to give the widest discretion to him.
 These are the two chief questions outstanding. As a matter of fact, the two are even one, because, if Act 2 of 1907 were repealed, the Immi-grants’ Restriction Act would not come in the way of highly educated Indians entering the Colony. We separate the question, because we wish to show that we have no desire to take any undue advantage of the facility provided under the Immigrants’ Restriction Act, but that we are quite sincere in our declaration that we have no desire to have unrestricted Asiatic immigration into the Colony. All we say is that, if the resident Asiatics are to be treated justly and if the whole Asiatic nations are not to be insulted, educated Asiatics should be treated under the general immigration law, and should not  be  called upon to submit to any registration Act.
 The other questions, namely, those of restoring registration certificates to those who have burned them, and the reinstatement of Mr. Sorabjee are, in our opinion, administrative details, and can be easily arranged when the main points are solved.
 We would mention that, whilst the new Actlibtech_345_footnotelibtech_346_footnote, which has just rece- ived the Royal sanction, is very reasonable, there are one or two flaws—for instance, in connection with the claims of those who are already in the Colony and who have entered bona fide, they cannot be called upon to submit to a three years’ residence test, because some who have not given such proof have already been granted registration certificates. It is also felt that, unless the widest latitude is given in the regulations with reference to the giving of thumb-impressions on application for licences, that particular section would  cause  the  greatest irritation.
 We assume that all those who are now suffering imprisonment will be discharged simultaneously with a settlement going through, if
 
 such a fortunate result is attained.
 In conclusion, we beg to mention that we have no desire to defy the Government, and we wish to remain in the country with peace and honour and in obedience to the general laws of the Colony. We have been obliged, most reluctantly and in obedience to a higher call, to oppose most strenuously the Asiatic Act. We need not, at this stage, go into the reasons for it, but we ask that our opposition to that Act may not be interpreted to mean defiance.
 We beg to add that the leaders who are at present  at  the Volksrust gaol, and who represent the flower of the Indian community in South Africa, as soon as they were sentenced, sent us the message that they were prepared to suffer to the utmost, but that we should not mind their sufferings but continue the struggle until what we think we are justly entitled to is granted.
 In accordance with your desire, we would treat this communication to be strictly confidential, and any message that you may convey to us will also be so regarded.
 With our renewed thanks for your kindly interest and for the assurance conveyed by General Smuts.
 We remain, etc.,

 I  have  the  honour  to  forward  herewith   a   copy   of   a   letterlibtech_347_footnote

94,"September 23, 1908",JOHANNESBURG LETTERlibtech_348_footnote,"
             HARDSHIPS 	IN GAOL  	It is becoming more certain each day that we shall be made to drain 	the cup of misery to its dregs. Mr. Syed Ali, who has just returned 	from gaol after seven days’ imprisonment at Boksburg, had no end 	of suffering to put up with. He had been sentenced to hard labour. 	He was made to carry closet buckets. He was made to stay in cold 	water for a long spell. He was kicked. How can one bear this? Mr. 	Cachalia has addressed a letterlibtech_349_footnoteto the Director of Prisons about Mr. Syed Ali. It 	will perhaps get a hearing, but whether or not it has any effect, we 	will carry buckets and suffer kicks. We will regard this as an 	expression of our nobility. Our bonds will be loosened [only] when 	we [learn to] enjoy carrying buckets. Only then may we claim that we 	understand the meaning of satyagraha. Satyagraha consists in not 	forsaking what we know to be truth, in enduring any suffering for 	its sake, no matter even if we die in the process. We should do no 	harm to anyone, for by harming others we violate truth. True victory 	will consist in cultivating the ability to bear with all this. Once 	we comprehend this basic principle, we shall surmount any obstacles 	the Government may set for us. I hope therefore that Indians will 	not be unnerved by [the report of] Mr. Syed Ali’s suffering but 	will be ever ready for gaol should the occasion require it.  NATAL 	PRISONERS  	The Natal prisoners are no longer being brought out on the roads to 	break stones. I for one feel disappointed at this. If they had to 	submit to the indignity of breaking stones, that would bring freedom 	nearer. They keep sending messages that no one need be anxious on 	their account. They are prepared for, and will indeed be happy with, 	[further] gaol terms of any duration. We must not [they     23.  
 insist] work for a hurried settlement because of them. For them it is the proper thing to say. And it will be right for us to ensure that they do not spend a minute longer in gaol than necessary; that others go to gaol without delay in order to secure their early release.
 OCTOBER: TRYING PERIOD
 Those who wish to secure the release of the brave leaders have a simple duty. October will test the mettle of many an Indian. By the end of September the licences of several hawkers will have expired. What will they do after that? It is their duty to refuse to take out licences, even if these are offered to them on their own terms—without their having to give thumb-impressions—as long as our demand is not accepted, and boldly to keep going their rounds without licences. The Government cannot afford this. Hence it is bound to throw the  hawkers into prison. And if they show pluck, we shall be free soon. I would even make bold to say that should this happen, we would be rid of all this worry after the middle of October and succeed by then in securing the release of those who have gone to gaol for our sake.
 HAWKERS’ MOVEMENT
 This is really a movement on behalf of the traders—especially the hawkers. The latter can also ensure its early success. By putting up a fight like this in this Colony, we can demonstrate that  there  is nothing undignified about hawking. True, hawkers are poor. [But] there is nobility in poverty. Viewing things in this light,  hawkers should hold their heads high, educate themselves, live well and not quarrel among themselves. I want them to be truly educated men. It is within their power to become that. They have yet many things to do in South Africa. I want to convince them and the Indian community at large that this is a campaign from which they can gain regal dignity.
 NEED FOR PICKETS
 Hawkers acted very courageously in January. They have done the same this time. Yet we remain cowards. We need to be watched. This is not surprising. Pickets should therefore be appointed in every town. They must mount guard outside the Licensing Office and see that no one goes there to take out a licence. To ensure this, the leaders of every community should set themselves up as watchmen. If that is done, hardly anyone would go there to take out a licence.
 PICKETS’ DUTY
 Pickets must remember not to employ violence against, nor attempt to intimidate, anyone. They must leave their lathis behind at
 home. Our power comes from our tongue, which, too, should be used gently and inoffensively. With every Indian they must use gentle persuasion to point  out  his  duty.  The  Krugersdorp  caselibtech_350_footnotelibtech_351_footnotemust  be borne in mind all the time. We must so behave as to  make  it  impossible for anyone to accuse us, however unjustifiably, of intimidation.
 Those who hold licences which are valid for the whole year ought not to use them but should surrender them to the Association.
 Those who cannot risk going to gaol had better give up hawking for a few days instead of taking out licences.
 MADRASIS AGAIN
 Mr. Chokalingam was arrested for trading without a licence. Having refused to pay the fine, he went to gaol on Saturday to serve seven days’ imprisonment. Mr. Godfrey appeared for the defence.
 Mr. Essop Kanamia was charged with failure to take out the new register. He was served with seven days’ notice [to leave to Colony]. His case was heard on Saturday, Mr. Godfrey attending.
 PRISONERS’ FOOD
 Correspondence on the subject of prisoners’ food is still going on. While the dispute about mealie pap has yet to be settled, we have information from the Director of Prisons that ghee was allowed in January only as a special concession and that there was in fact no provision for it in the rules. In Johannesburg, ghee is still served. But it is not in Volksrust, and that is how the question arose. Mr. Cachalia has written a strong letterlibtech_352_footnotelibtech_353_footnoteabout this, and cables have also been sent to England. Let us see what happens now. Whether or not we are allowed good food makes no difference to us. If the Government inflicts this further cruelty on us, we should be determined enough to bear that too.

 Mr. Isa Hajee Sumar, a Standerton trader of long standing, has returned from a trip to England. I hope that he will join the campaign and help whole-heartedly.
 NEW BILL
The  new  Billlibtech_354_footnotelibtech_355_footnotehas  received  Royal  assent.  The  law  has  some
 
 advantages for us. Just as we would not submit to the humiliation of the obnoxious Act, so do we not want to take advantage of this new Act, as long as two issueslibtech_356_footnoteremain unsettled. [Furthermore,] we cannot accept any advantage accruing from the new Act as long as those whom we have sent to gaol are not released.
 KING-EMPEROR’S GUESTS
 
 Mr. Magan Jivan, Mr. Gurunathan and Mr. Chetty Parag--these Indians entered Johannesburg Gaol today to serve a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment. They were found trading without licences. All of them were defended by Mr. George Godfrey. A telegram has been received from the committee at Roodepoort to the effect that Mr. Dahya Ragha was also sentenced to seven days’ imprisonment for hawking without a licence.
Regret
 I have to report with regret that the Government has withdrawn the   case   against   Mr.   Muljibhai   Patel   and   Mr.   Harilal   Gandhi.libtech_357_footnoteUnfortunately for them, these two young men have been denied the opportunity to do homage to the brave Natal prisoners.
Further Regret
 I have heard that Mr. Hassan Mialibtech_358_footnotegave his thumb-impression at Volksrust while returning from Durban.
Adam Mahomed Gool
 The President of the British Indian League [of the Cape] is here on a visit. He has handed over his certificate to be burnt. The police did not ask him for his thumb-impression at  Volksrust  when  he arrived there. Even if they had, he would have refused.
 BELIM
 Mr. Belim was  released  in  Christiana  on  the  19th  after  he  had served a sentence of  a  month’s  hard  labour. He has rece- ived congratulatory telegrams. The  reader  wil  recall  that  Mr. Belim’s partner was also sentenced to a month’s imprisonment. So he

 transferred [the ownership of his shop] nominally to a white and thus, instead of closing it down, kept it going.
 MOVING LETTER
 An Indian, who signs himself “A Poor Indian Harassed by the Law”, writes as follows:
 Please do something about solving the [problem of this] law, so that we can somehow return to India safely [after the end of our stay here]. Otherwise we shall be as good as finished. In the existing situation, it is the middle classes that suffer most. The big businessmen who have a large capital are not refused credit. Whites who used to order goods on our behalf ranging in value from £200 to £500 now refuse credit even up to 5 s. They say that they will suspend dealings [with us] until a settlement is reached as regards the law. If something is done to effect a settlement which will safeguard the interests of us poor folk, we can breathe a sigh of relief. Please see to it that we do not have to suffer longer.
 We cannot help sympathizing with the person who wrote this. I must say, all the same, that he is mistaken in what he says. It is a mistake to assume, as he has done, that the people who have the capital stand to lose nothing. The rich have had to suffer heavier losses, the poor, smaller. Every Indian soldier [in this campaign] has suffered thus. The whites may refuse to supply us goods on credit, but it is not as though they were the [only] hallowed menlibtech_359_footnote[that we may not go to others]. We must of course be prepared for harassment by the whites. Financial loss suffered for the country’s sake should not cause us distress. Having said this, I do admit that this letter expresses the views of a number of Indians. It is in accordance with these that  the campaign is being waged. The leaders have ensured that the community carries only those burdens which it can bear. In view of this, not a single Indian should lose heart.
 KRUGERSDORP
 Adverting to the newspaper report about Krugersdorp hawkers not making their rounds, Mr. Khurshedji Desai writes that the charge is entirely false and [adds] that the Indian hawkers in that town are carrying on trade without licences.
 
 ABOUT NEW ACT
 The new Act comes into force from today. A notice for taking out registers will not be issued under it. It is said that the notice period will extend up to November 30. Indians resident in the Transvaal have to take out permits within that period. As for those who are outside the Colony and do not hold the yellow permits, they have to apply within a year. There is nothing, let it be remembered, that either of these [categories of persons] need do yet. There is no need to hurry. Until a settlement is reached, it would not be meet to take advantage of this law. It will therefore be necessary to post pickets at the Permit Office. If this is done, and no licences are taken out, a settlement will soon be reached.
 CONFUSION
 A number of queries have been received following The Transvaal Leader report that the community would be content to have only six educated Indians admitted into the Colony every year.libtech_360_footnotelibtech_361_footnoteSome say that this is a fight only for securing the admission of six men, others that this is a new issue altogether. There is some misunderstanding here. Our demand is that, in law, all educated persons should have equal rights. We have already agreed that once there is a single law [for all immigrants], the test can be as severe as [the authorities] wish, so that hardly a single Indian may actually qualify for entry. That is to say, those who pass the education test prescribed by law will be entitled to enter. We cannot then protest if they do not subject the whites to any test, or only to a very simple one, but give the Indians a severe test. If this is done, we will not object. The question has been asked as to how we stand to gain by this. To this we can reply that we do not want the humiliation of a legal bar, even with the provision for the entry of a limited number of Indians. It follows from this line of reasoning that not a single Indian may be admitted, instead of which the entry of six is being ensured [in the suggested compromise]. Our campaign is directed only against the closing of the door [to Asiatics] by law. If the door is closed by law, it will be difficult to re-open it. If it is closed in practice because the
 
 …… Even if the full number of six came every year, we doubt if that formidable invasion would ruin the Transvaal. This principle of limitation is almost the rule with other members of the Empire as to Asiatic immigration.” Vide also “Letter to W. Kosken”, 19-11-1908.
 
 official who holds the test does not allow [the would-be immigrants] to pass, remedial measures can be found. Natal and the Cape have a law of this kind. The whites do not have to pass a test. The test for Indians grows more severe every year. A [similar] law is still in force in Australia; yet whites have been entering in their hundreds. The test for Indians is so severe that not a single Indian has been able to get in so far. However, when the prejudice among the Australian people dies down, or when the official in charge is considerate, Indians may be allowed to enter after a reasonable test. It is therefore to respect the Colonists’ feelings and demonstrate the Indian community’s reasonableness that a suggestion has been made for limiting the number to six. The law should be the same [for all], but it may be administered differentially; that is all that the demand means. There is thus no difference between this demand and the one that was put forward at the mass meeting and which was described by General Smuts as an ultimatumlibtech_362_footnote(that is, a demand that implied the threa of war).
 CHINESE HELP
 On behalf of the Chinese Association, Mr. Quinn has offered
 £60 for being sent to the [S.A.B.I.] Committee in London. The reader will recall that on a previous occasion also an equal amount was presented to Mr. Ritch by the Chinese Association. It also contributed towards the expenditure incurred on the case in the Supreme Court field in the name of Mr. Aswat.libtech_363_footnote
 HELP FROM CONGRESS
 A telegram has been received from the [Natal Indian] Congress saying that a sum of £100 has been cabled to the London Committee. This should have been done earlier. However, even now it has not been too late.
 Wednesday [September 23, 1908]
 VOLKSRUST PRISONERS
 Mr. Harilal Gandhi has arrived here after his release from Volksrust. He spent three nights [in gaol] with the Natal busines-smen. He reports that the prisoners are keeping good health. They cheerfully carry out their allotted tasks. Now they are not brought out [to break stones on the roads] but are made to sweep the garden and do similar chores inside the gaol. Mr. Dawad Mahomed is happy as a
 
 bird with the song constantly on his lips; “Rustomlibtech_364_footnotelibtech_365_footnote, the only one who became a benefactor equal to Vikramlibtech_366_footnotelibtech_367_footnotelibtech_368_footnote”. 
 REGULATIONS UNDER NEW ACT
 Regulations under the new Act have been published. I shall comment on them next week. At the moment I shall only observe that these regulations are far better than the earlier ones. They, however, present some difficulties which call for attention; these can be resolved when a settlement is arrived at. But I hope every Indian will show patience. No one need apply in a hurry.
 TAMILS’ EFFORTS
 The Madrasis are doing excellent work. They keep going to gaol. Also, they are never found to be slack in collecting funds. They have given the Association a cheque for £82.1.0. We thus see that those who go to gaol are also generous in contributing money. Those who exert themselves in one sphere can do well in others also.
 ESSOP ISMAIL BELIMlibtech_369_footnote
 [He] writes from Christiana to say that during the first week in gaol he was asked to cook. The following week he was given assorted chores and during the last week he was made to work outdoors on the roads. The food was much the same as elsewhere. The only thing which he minded was being asked to take his cap off during meals. He adds that is suffering privations for the sake of his country, he has done no more than his duty and that he would be ready to do so again if there was need.
 SETTLEMENT?
 A proposal for a settlement was made by Mr. Hosken.  Mr. Smuts had a talk with him. Consequent upon this, Mr. Hosken invited Mr. Cachalia, Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, Mr. Quinn, Mr. Kimson, Mr. Naidoo and Mr. Gandhi [for a discussion]. He also invited Mr. Cartwright and Mr. David Pollock. In the end, a letterlibtech_370_footnotelibtech_371_footnotewas despatched to Mr. Hosken reiterating the demand made earlier at the mass meeting. Mr. Hosken forwarded the letter to Mr. Smuts. A reply has been received from the latter today, in which he says that the
 
 
 demand is the same as that made previously, and that it cannot be conceded. There is no reason to be disheartened by this. Mr. Smuts has a right to ascertain whether or not we will submit to the new Act. A solution will be found only when we pass that test [set by him] and are found prepared to renounce everything.
 BRITISH NEWSPAPERS
 
 Newspapers in Britain have been suggesting that we give in at this stage. They want us to submit to the new Act without raising [further] objections. This is fine advice indeed ! It cannot be accepted. It need not be. It is the same old story. For us there is only one duty. Our demand is just. We must therefore continue to fight till it is conceded. We must fill the gaols, and refuse to take advantage of the new Act.
 VALLY MAHOMED
 
 Mr. Vally Mahomed, who came out of Pretoria gaol after five days inside and was received with great enthusiasm, says that no one took the mealie pap served in gaol, because it was suspected to contain lard. Mr. Ismail Juma [he adds] was given kicks because he would not line up along with the other prisoners. When an opportunity for complaint to the Governor about this presented itself, the chief warder would not allow it. The prisoners were made to mop hospital floors, carry buckets full of garbage and wash clothes. Such privations notwithstanding, every Indian must keep himself ready to go to gaol. I congratulate the Indian prisoners in Pretoria on their having gone to gaol and suffered privations for their country’s sake.

 THE DIRECTOR OF PRISONS PRETORIA
SIR,
 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th instant in regard to the question of the scale of diet in force for Indian prisoners in the Transvaal prisons.
 I learn for the first time that, instead of there being, as my Association supposed, one scale of diet throughout  the  Transvaal, there are a number of diet scales in force which vary according to the different prisons. My Association is of opinion that this principle of differentiation tends to impose great hardship upon those who are differentiated against, and will be glad to learn whether it is the intention of the Government to appoint a fixed scale of diet for Indian prisoners throughout the Transvaal; and this apart altogether from the question of the meagreness of the diet as exemplified in Johannesburg, to which my Association has already drawn repeated attention.
 I would once more demur to the suggestion that the giving of ghee is an act of grace and not a matter of dietary regulation, as I know it to be a fact that ghee, in January last, figured on the printed dietscale at the Johannesburg Gaol. My Association will be glad to learn whether it is finally the intention of the authorities to substitute, in regard to Indian prisoners, ghee wherever fat is prescribed in the Regulations, in view of the religious objection existing to the eating of fat by Indians.
 My Association regrets to find from your letter under reply that its suspicions are confirmed that it is the intention of the Government to starve Indians into submission by compelling them to accept a diet totally unsuited to their habits of life.
 I have, etc.,

97,,HOW NATAL CAN HELP,"
        
 Natal greatly helped in the Transvaal campaign last yearlibtech_374_footnotelibtech_375_footnote. This time it has surpassed all expectations. The leading figures and the educated Indians in that Colony have gone to gaol of  their  own accord.
 But this has involved Natal deeper in the campaign. It has now to bear the same burden as the Transvaal. It has become the duty of the Transvaal as much as it is of Natal to ensure the early release of the Natal prisonerslibtech_376_footnote. What needs to be done by the Transvaal has been indicated in our Johannesburg Letterlibtech_377_footnote. Let us therefore think to Natal [for the present].
 One of Natal’s duties is to remit money regularly in order to maintain the [S.A.B.I.] Committee in London. For that purpose, collections should be speeded up. It is a matter for satisfaction that steps are being taken towards this.libtech_378_footnote
 Its second duty is that those of its remaining leaders, who were formerly residents of the Transvaal, and well-educated Indians, such as barristers and physicians, should enter the Transvaal and follow Mr. Dawad Mahomed. Also, those holding £3 registers or permits should be sent to the Transvaal. None of them should give his thumb- impression at the border, and they should thus fill the Transvaal gaols in order to secure the legitimate rights [of Indians]. If that is done, the agitation is bound soon to come to a successful conclusion, and many Indians will have had the opportunity to test their newlyacquired power.
 In any case, there can be no doubt that steps such as these will benefit Natal greatly. It has many more battles to fight yet. It has to fight for the repeal of the law about trade, for the ending of the indentured labourers’ disabilities and for the cancellation of the oppressive £3 poll-tax. If a large number of leaders put their new power to test, the experience will stand them in good stead when they attempt to achieve all these things. When the whites realize that we have acquired this power, they will think twice before they decide to harass us.
 
“Johannesburg Letter”, 7-9-1908.
 A steamer from Bombay is due to call very shortly at a Natal port. Many of the Indians on board are bound for the Transvaal. It is the Natal Indians’ duty to reason with them, to explain the situation to them and to ensure that they do not give their thumb-impressions under any circumstances while entering the Transvaal. It is essential to depute volunteers immediately for this purpose. We  invite  the attention of every Indian to these suggestions.

  "
102,"September 30, 1908",INTERVIEW TO “THE NATAL MERCURY”,"
        
 [DURBAN,
 September 30, 1908]
 Mr. M.K. Gandhi, the doughty champion of the Indians’ cause in  the Transvaal, is at present on a visit to Durban, and was interviewed yesterday by a representative of this journal.
 Asked what his object was in coming to Durban at the present time, he said he was here in connection with the question of those Indians who had a right to return to the Transvaal owing to their having been pre-war residents; and, particularly, to see those Indians who were expected by the German steamer Governer,  which  was bringing a fair number of Indian passengers for the Transvaal.
 In reply to a query as to the present position of Indians in the Transvaal, M. Gandhi said the fight resolved itself into this, that those who were entitled to be in the Transvaal shall be allowed to enter the Colony, but not give the Government any help with reference to identification, until the two outstanding questions were settled.
 “How is this attitude reconciled with the law-abiding nature of  British Indians?” queried the interviewer, and Mr. Gandhi replied that he held there was nothing defiant in the Indians’ attitude. It should be remembered that British Indians were not represented in the Transvaal Parliament, and the only effective manner in which they could make themselves heard was to refuse submission to laws in the passing of which they had no hand, and which violated their conscience or their self- respect. The Indians, he said, held that General Smuts was in honour bound to repeal the Asiatic Act, but he said he would treat it as a “dead letter”. The Indians said that [that] was not enough, and he (Mr. Gandhi) noticed that even now the old Act was by no means a dead latter. Under the circumstances, British Indians asked General Smuts to fulfil his promise by repealing the Act, and, until this was done, they had been advised not to accept the benefits accruing from the new Act. This, to Mr. Gandhi’s mind, was an act of renunciation by the Indian community which  should  be  appreciated by the Colonists throughout South Africa.
 “But what as to the educational question?” was the next query, to which Mr. Gandhi replied that the answer was very simple. If the Act were repealed, the immigration law of the Transvaal would be almost the same as that of Natal. British Indians stated that the Transvaal should not be allowed by the Imperial Government, and by those who love the Empire, to lay down a new policy of exclusion based purely on race and colour. The present immigration law of the Transvaal, with the assistance of the old Asiatic Act brought about such a constitution. Indians, therefore, contended that such should not be the case.
 The people of the Transvaal, he said, were frightened with the bogey of an invasion of half-educated youths from Natal, but this was due only to ignorance. Indians were not fighting for the rights of half-educated fellow-countrymen. They
 
 were fighting for the honour of India, and for a principle--the same principle that was laid down by Mr. Chamberlain before the Conference of Colonial Premiers, viz., that restriction should be based on sensible grounds, and not on grounds of colour or race. Once, said Mr. Gandhi, the status of educated Indians was established on a footing of equality in the eye of the law, he personally had no quarrel about the severity of the education rest. The essential difference seemed to him to be this: The people in the Transvaal, as indeed in South Africa, tolerated British Indians as an evil; Indians, on the other hand, claimed that those who were domiciled in South Africa should form part of the future nation that was coming into being, and that they should be encouraged in every way to make progress towards refinement and culture. In making this statement, he was simply paraphrasing what Mr. Patrick Duncan said the other day—that was to say, that, in a free and self-governed South Africa, it would not be possible to contemplate a body of human beings living in a state of servility, or studied and legal inferiority.
 In taking this stand against any such degradation, Mr. Gandhi claimed that his countrymen should receive the sympathy and assistance of all who loved South Africa as their home, and who wished well to it. He wanted to make one thing perfectly clear, which was that Indians had no desire to have further unrestricted immigration of Asiatics into any part of South Africa, nor did they wish that there should be no [sic] regulations on unenlightened lines of trade licences in general, but, after these two propositions were established, there should certainly be no differential legislation, otherwise he could only repeat what he had said so often, that in South Africa would be sown the seeds of disruption of the Empire. They could not have India as the brightest jewel in the British Crown, and yet use that jewel as a target from every point.
 Mr. Gandhi next made the following statement, in reply to a question as to what he thought would be the effect of unification upon Indians in general: This was a question he had answered before a meeting of the Closer Union Society that had been formed in Johannesburg.libtech_387_footnoteHe there stated that a United South Africa meant for British Indians greater restriction of their liberty, unless a unified South Africa meant unification not only of the white races, but of all British subjects, whether Coloured or white, who had chosen South Africa as their permanent home. Under such unification, one would expect liberal principles guiding Indian legislation, but one heard often talk of disfranchisement at the Cape, and further disabilities in Natal. The goal of unification seemed to be the nearest approached by the Orange River Colony, so far as Asiatic legislation was concerned. In that Colony, Asiatics had absolutely no footing, except as domestic servants. It must be plain to anybody that Indians who has vested rights, who had children to educate, and families to rear, would not be satisfied with such a status, and that they would carry on a bitter struggle before they accepted a position such as he had described. He could not conceive how the Imperial Government could possibly look with approval upon a scheme of unification which
 
 would mean the reduction of Asiatics and Natives to a state practically of slavery.
 The next point touched upon was embraced in the following query: “What is the feeling of British Indians with reference to the local leaders who have been imprisoned in the Transvaal?”
 Mr. Gandhi replied that, from what he could see, the feeling was very bitter. His countrymen failed to understand why, in a British Colony. British Indians should have to suffer imprisonment because they dared to enter the Transvaal. The situation would appear much more painful when he said that the three leaders were pre-war residents of the Transvaal. Three educated Indians were also suffering imprisonment with them who were stretcher-bearers, and held the rank of sergeants at the time of the Zulu rebellion.libtech_388_footnoteIt would be remembered that their services were so much valued that Sir Henry McCallum specia-lly recognized them, and, of course, those ex-sergeants were entitled to their medals, and would receive them on being released. It must appear strange to anybody that such men should be imprisoned, with hard labour, for merely daring to enter the Transvaal. One of the leaders imprisoned was known to every prominent Durbanite--Mr. Dawad Mahomed, the chairman of the Natal  Indian Congress; the other, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, was equally well known and the third, Mr.
 M.C. Anglia, besides being a prominent merchant, and secretary of the Congress, had received a very good education in English and French. The Indians of Durban, therefore, felt that they had to suffer in order that these leaders might be released before their time. They were, therefore, considering the advisability of sending up more Indians, who had a right to enter the Transvaal, to share the same fate as the leaders. It was quite evident that General Smuts had rendered an indirect service to British Indians throughout South Africa. They had been brought together as never before, and they had also begun to understand their own position, and to realize that they must work shoulder to shoulder, and undergo much suffering, if they were to be recognized as self-respecting men in South Africa.
 The reports received from these leaders, through prisoners who had been discharged, were to the effect, said Mr. Gandhi, that they were perfectly cheerful, although the Government was simply starving them in regard to their diet, by reason of providing food which was not suited to Indian habits. The leaders stated that they would continue to be in gaol until the struggle was over, and the just rights of British Indians in the Transvaal were recognized. Most of them had already been sent out in the public roads to break stones. Most of the leaders, Mr. Gandhi added, were very delicate, and Mr. Dawad Mahomed was old, and could hardly life a weight, but such was his love for his country, he understood, that he performed the allotted task with the utmost cheerfulness.
 “Do you think the trouble here produces any effect in India?” further queried the interviewer. Mr. Gandhi answered that he certainly thought it did. The meeting that was held last January in Bombay under the presidency of His Highness the Aga Khan was very widely attended. Anglo-Indians and Indians were absolutely united on this
 
 
 question, and so were Mahomedans, Hindoos, Christians, and Parsees. The protest male at the Bombay meeting was emphatic and unanimous. Advice[s] lately received also showed that the treatment in the Transvaal and consequent suffering had affected British India very deeply. Mr. T. J. Bennett, who was the proprietor of one of the leading newspapers of India, writing to the London Times. the other day, had said that during his recent travels in India he found that Indians, rich and poor, maharajahs and
 plebeians, resented the treatment very bitterly, and all wondered what the Imperial Government was doing to allow [sic] it. There was no doubt that Lord Morley was being pressed, in connection with this question, from many parts of India. Those in India who were the warmest friends of the Empire had been moving heaven and earth in order to secure fair treatment in the Transvaal, as, also, indeed, in South Africa.
 Turning now to the local questions affecting Indians, our representative asked Mr. Gandhi what he thought of the Indian Bills passed during the last session.
 To this query, he replied that he would be very much surprised indeed if these Indian Bills received the Royal assent. They laid down a principle, not of compensation, but of confiscation. An analogy had been drawn between liquor licensing legislation at Home and trade licences. Surely there should be no  comparison between the two. Liquor licences were admitted to be an evil, and the cause of national degradation. Everyone wanted to see public-houses restricted, if not done away with altogether. Naturally, therefore, there would be, or must be,  legislation with reference to these licences; indeed, with reference to them, the question was one of compensation or no compensation. All parties were agreed that many public-houses should be closed, but with reference to  trading  licences. Whatever might be the local prejudices, nobody could seriously contend that they should be treated on the same footing as liquor licences. To his mind, so long as the system of inducing indentured labour from India was continued, there certainly would be no rest in Natal, so far as Indians were concerned, Licensing legislation was merely a useless palliative. If indentured immigration were stopped, they would find that the Indian question would solve itself. There was scope enough for the present population of Natal, and the European population should certainly expand without taking the bread away from the mouths of the free Indian population. But if the system of indenture were continued, there must necessarily be a forced addition to the Indian population, and, consequently, agitation. Of course, some of the industries of Natal would, at the commencement, suffer, but he could not help thinking that it was much better that these industries should suffer than that they should have an eternal eyesore in the Colony. There might be even a way of compensating these particular industries, but indentured labour should be stopped at the earliest possible moment.
 In this, concluded Mr. Gandhi, Indians could always be relied upon; they were just an anxious that the system should be stopped as any Colonist could be, and he only hoped that Mr. Evans, who had commenced his crusade against the system, would not rest satisfied until it was abolished.

106,,NATAL INDENTURED LABOURERS,"
        
 The [Natal] Advertiser, of Durban, is a determined enemy of the Indian community. Even so, Its editor could not remain unmoved by the sufferings of the Indian indentured labourers. In a lengthy comment, he has shown that the condition of Indians under indenture is not far different from slavery. The members of the Immigration Trust, which administers the affairs of indentured  labourers,  are elected by their white employers. It is these members who appoint the physicians to look after indentured labourers. Whether the labourers are happy or not depends very largely on the physicians. If the latter in their turn depend for their livelihood on the employers of  indentured labour, they are not generally free to express their own views. For instance, if a physician certifies that a certain Indian is physically unfit, the employer will not only be deprived of the benefit of his labour during the period of his illness, but will also be required to bear the expenses of his treatment. A physician who discharges his duty faithfully is thus likely to incur the displeasure of the employer. When there is conflict between duty and self-interest, most men prefer the latter. The Advertiser suggests therefore that the physicians should be free from the control of the employers. The Protector of Indians is almost in the same predicament as the physician. The Protector is a member of the Trust Board. Since many of the members of the Board are themselves employers of indentured labour, the  Protector  can make himself heard no more than a reed. The Advertiser states further that an indentured labourer who deserts work has to suffer imprisonment. Ordinarily, when a servant throws up his job, his employer can only file a civil suit against him. For the indentured labourer, on the other hand, no better lot is ordained than imprisonment. Pointing out that these conditions are the marks of slavery, the editor of the Advertiser urges the whites of the Colony to stop importation of indentured labour from India and to amend the regulations relating to indenture. This is a fine opportunity to secure some improvement in the conditions of indentured labourers. We believe, however, that no improvement of any real value is possible. The best way is to stop the system of indenture. Indian newspapers have published the experiences of an indentured labourer in Mauritius. We summarize these elsewhere.libtech_398_footnotelibtech_399_footnotelibtech_400_footnoteProbably the reports are somewhat exaggerated. It is certain, however, that the condition of indentured labourers in utterly miserable. Indian indentured labourers
 
 are not found to be happy in any part of the world. A study of world history tells us that at first slaves were generally kept as a substitute for cattle and were treated as such, and that as soon as legalized slavery had disappeared, thanks to the powerful influence of the British people, it was reintroduced in other forms. In all such places, or in the neighbourhood of such places, where Indians or members of other communities are employed at present to work under a system of indenture, it was the practice formerly to employ slaves. It is natural for the rich to want to control others by force. The only way to prevent the suffering which may result from this tendency of theirs is to limit their powers by law. In other words, the method of exploiting human labour under a system of indenture should be prohibited by law. Therefore, the main duty of Natal Indians in this matter is to start an agitation on a big scale, to adopt satyagraha, if necessary, and bring the system of indenture to an end.

107,,REAL EDUCATION,"
        
 We have sometimes been told, orally and in writing, that the satyagraha campaign in the Transvaal, which we have been sponsoring and for which we have been making sacrifices, is all a vain effort. These advisers of ours argue, moreover, that there is no justification for such an effort for the sake of the handful of Indians who live in South Africa. And in any case, [they say,] Indians will have no choice in the end but to leave this country. It will then be found that we had been building on foundations of sand.
 Such reflections have given rise to doubts in the minds of some of our readers. Let us consider this matter a little.
 We have no hesitation in saying that the argument is entirely fallacious. Those who advance it do not understand the deep significance and the marvellous power of satyagraha. It is a counsel of despair to say that Indians will be forced to leave South Africa in the end. We visualize no such possibility. If the Indian community can practise satyagraha even in a small measure, there is no reason why it should have to leave this country.
 But, even if it is obliged to leave the country, it will have already enjoyed the fruits of satyagraha. That one can secure one’s rights through satyagraha is not the reason why it is practised. Securing one’s rights is one of the results, but satyagraha can be offered
 without thinking of the result. As for efforts of other kinds, we count them wasted if there are no results. For instance, if a man aims at seizing the property of another by killing him, and fails either to kill him or to get the property, he will feel frustrated and, maybe, will himself have to face death. In satyagraha, it makes no difference whether the result is achieved or not. For, there is no cause for frustration in the event of failure. In the case of the Transvaal  agitation, even if the obnoxious law had continued to be in force, those who resorted to satyagraha would have ever remained victorious. Their efforts would have done the community no harm. Putting the same thing in another way, we can say that satyagraha is a kind of education in the real sense of the term. If we undergo education with a specific object in view, such as earning our livelihood, the education that has been received will not be wasted even though we fail to earn our livelihood through it. In like manner, the invaluable education-- the benefit--received through the strengthening of will power which results from our adherence to truth and suffering hardships for its sake, is never lost. Those who became satyagrahis, and have remained so, will reap the benefits of satyagraha in any part of the world where they may go.
 If, moreover, we look closely into the result of satyagraha, we shall find that it is always the same, that it is invariably good. If on any occasion we fail to discover such a result, it will not be because of any imperfection in satyagraha as such, but because people might not have been steadfast in their satyagraha.

108,,OUR AIM,"
        
 It is the object of those, both whites and Indians, who  are engaged in publishing this paper, to serve the entire human race. There is an obvious reason why the first duty of the whites and of the Indians living in Phoenix is to serve the Indian community. Indians must, of course, serve India. If, instead of doing that, anyone were to claim that he was dedicated to the service of mankind as a whole, it would be nothing more than a pretence—it would be no service, or anything that could be called service. The whites who have joined us were formerly engaged in their own avocations. There was no need for them to offer their services to the white community. Wishing to renounce their selfish pursuits and to devote themselves to the service of others, they decided to join the journal. That is how we look at the
 matter.
 But we cannot be content with merely bringing out a paper. Those who have chosen to settle in Phoenix wish to educate themselves and to extend the benefits of their education to the entire Indian people. With this end in view, those members of the journal’s staff who can teach devote a part of their time to the education of the children living in Phoenix. That arrangement has been in force for several months past. The members engaged in this teaching work neither receive nor expect payment.
 The number of children at Phoenix is so small that it has not been found necessary to have a separate school building for them. Mr. Cordeslibtech_401_footnotelibtech_402_footnotehas offered the use of his building for the purpose.
 Teaching is done through both Gujarati and English. Attention is paid to the simultaneous development of mind and body. Special emphasis is laid on strengthening the moral character of pupils.
 We aim at making such education available to all Indian children. Our chief object is to provide education to those children only who may live in Phoenix. For, it is not good for children to have one standard of behaviour in the school and another at home.
 Some who have heard of this school have expressed a desire to send their children to Phoenix. But we are not in a position to meet their request for want of residential and school accommo-dation facilities.
 We do not have the resources for putting up the required buildings. The buildings need money. We therefore invite the views of those among our readers who believe that a school along the lines indicated above should be established. If they offer us monetary help, we shall be prepared to put up a building for the school as also a hostel. Trustees may be appointed to supervise the expenditure to be incurred and the accounts of all expenditure on construction of buildings may be published. This is a big undertaking and it is after long deliberation, therefore, that we place the matter before our readers.

 RUSTOMJEE’S MESSAGE
 On behalf of the prisoners, Mr. Rustomjee has sent a message that “instead of taking any hasty step to seek a compromise, we  should obtain everyone’s signature”. These are his own words. They show the prisoners’ courage, and point out their duty to Indians.
 WARNING
 On receipt of a report that a steamer named Governeur was due to arrive in Durban with Indian passengers aboard, and that Mr. Chamney would receive applications from them on board the steamer, telegraphic instructions were sent to Mr. Ismail Manga, Mr. Ismail Halimbhai, Mr. Hormusji Edulji, Mr. Nanji Durlabh-adas and Mr. Vrijdas Lalchand that they should warn the Delagoa Bay passengers not to walk into the trap laid by the Government. They should be asked to disembark at Durban and proceed thence to the Transvaal to join the movement there. Owing to an error of a day in calculation, no one could be deputed specially for the purpose. Mr. Cama and Mr. Nagadi had got ready to go.
 PRISONERS’ DIET
 The British Indian Association and the Government are still at odds with each other with regard to the prisoners’ diet. There are now two complaints instead of one. As for mealie pap at breakfast, Mr. Cachalia has already taken up the issue [with the authorities]. But it is stated now by the Director of Prisons that food arrange-ments differ from prison to prison. The Government has been asked to supply copies of the different manuals on this subject.
 “DAILY MAIL” COMMENT
 Commenting on this in its issue of Saturday last, the [Rand] Daily Mail observes that there is no uniform scale for Indian prisoners throughout the Colony. This is quite surprising. In one of the prisons, Indians are allowed a diet to which they are used. Elsewhere they are given maize flour and animal fat which they can refuse only on pain of being starved. The complaint, the journal thinks, deserves to be attended to. An orthodox Hindu will prefer to die rather than touch to
 
 
 animal fat. When men are sentenced in this country, they are not sentenced to starvation. If a white prisoner, who happens to be a vegetarian, were asked to accept non-vegetarian diet or starve, or if a Jew were asked to accept animal fat or go without food, there would be an uproar; or, if whisky and soda were to be offered to those who never take them, on pain of their having to go thirsty if they did not accept them, there would be a big outcry. In whatever gaols Indian prisoners are lodged, they must get their rice and ghee.
 CHAMNEY UNFIT?
 Mr. Gandhi has often told General Smuts that Mr. Chamney is quite unfit for the post he is holding.libtech_404_footnotelibtech_405_footnoteIt was a good thing that Mr. Bhaiji was sentenced to a month’s imprisonment. I congratulate him. But why should Mr. Bhaiji have been sentenced when Mr. Mulji Patel and Mr. Harilal Gandhi we discharged? Mr. Bhaiji, too, holds [both] the permit [and] the register. He is also, like the other two, entitled to apply under the new Act. That Mr. Bhaiji does not intend to apply is quite another matter. But the Government had in fact no power to arrest him for two months. Mr. Polak has criticized this case in very strong terms. If has brought us nothing but gain. However, my object in referring to this matter is [to show] that it may perhaps be necessary for the British Indian Association to petition for the removal of Mr. Chamney. I do not want Mr. Chamney to be deprived of his means of livelihood, but an officer who is altogether ignorant of his duty can do not good to the community.
 Looking at the matter from another point of view, we feel that the Indian community has profited by Mr. Chamney’s ignorance. Had he not been guilty of serious errors, we would not have won our freedom so soon in the measure that we have done. In regard to the issues still pending, we shall be free quite soon, thanks to Mr. Chamney’s errors.
 COURAGEOUS LETTER
 “A Poor Indian Harassed by the Law”, whose letter I gave earlier,libtech_406_footnotehas now assumed the name, “A Dauntless Soldier of Satya- graha”, and written to say that he did not write that letter in a defeatist mood. He had only given expression to the thoughts of many. As for himself, he will not allow his mind to be influenced by considerations of health or money. He would welcome whatever suffering might be
 
 inflicted [on him] in the faith that all that we do must be for the [common] good. Anyone [he goes on to say,] who clings  to satyagraha with courage and faith in truth is bound to win.
 I congratulate this satyagrahi, and hope that he will remain firm till the end.

 "
113,,WHY IS RELEASE OF BUSINESSMEN DELAYED?,"
        
 Many Indians have been asking this question. The answer is that our satyagraha is imperfect. A satyagraha campaign obeys the rule of three. We can load a cart in proportion to its strength. If overloaded, the cart may give way. The same holds good in the case of the satyagraha cart. The businessmen have gone to gaol for the sake of the community. To be sure, the cart of their sufferings will carry the load of other Indians’ happiness. But it will move forward rapidly if others put their hands to the wheel. If no men come forward for this, the cart will be stranded on the way. Not that it will break. But it may take time to reach the destination. Satyagraha is in no way to blame for this. The continued delay shows that the satyagraha is not as intensive as it should be. Because of this the cart has slowed down. If more men come forward to join satyagraha, the end will come quite soon. This is simple enough.
 In Natal, hundreds of Indians went to see the businessmen off. Many of them expressed readiness to follow them. But now that the time has come, only 13 have come forward. Many showed themselves ready for work. Now that the time has arrived, they are not to be found anywhere. Everyone seems to ask what he himself would gain, forgetting that satyagraha can be offered only to advance the interests of others. One need not even be conscious that the interests of others include one’s own. Natal has not acted in this manner, though it is not to blame for this. It only shows that we have not had enough experience, that we lack the capacity to suffer, that we lack knowledge.
 
 We shall acquire these things in due course. Meanwhile, we need not grow impatient if there is delay in achieving the desired result in any particular case.
 For the present, those who understand what satyagraha means should remain steadfast in it. Even if only one man is left, he can continue satyagraha. He will have done his whole duty. One can do no more.

 "
114,,SOME PROBLEMS OF NATAL,"
        
 We think the condition of Natal Indians is deteriorating day by day. The present Government here is altogether bad, unsure of its ground and indifferent to Indians.
Traders will begin to experience hardships in regard to licences.
 The poll-tax on labourers whose indenture has expired is an oppressive burden.
 Those who are slaving under the system of indenture are treated harshly by their masters.
New restrictive laws continue to be enacted.
 Grants-in-aid to schools have been reduced. Boys above the age of fourteen are not allowed to be admitted.
 What should be done to remedy all this? should a petition be made? Will it do any good? What if it does not? If satyagraha is advised, should all of them act collectively or each group for itself?
 We should patiently seek answers to all these questions. A petition must certainly be made. But it should have some sanctions behind it. These sanctions can be created by satyagraha.
 But satyagraha can be offered only by a man who understands truth. If we knew what truth meant and acted accordingly, there would have been no such hardships as those mentioned above. How, then, can we offer satyagraha? The answer is that resistance through satyagraha itself implies that we gradually learn to follow truth. Our grievances will disappear in the measure in which we cultivate truthfulness.
 We shall consider some time later how satyagraha can be offered in particular situations.

115,"October 10, 1908",PRISONERS’ CONDITIONlibtech_415_footnote,"
        
 Saturday [October 10, 1908] Just as in January [1908]  the Johannesburg prison had overflowed with Indians, this time it is Volksrust gaol which has
 overflowed. More Indians are coming in. Today there are 37 in gaol, from among whom the following 17 persons are serving sentences of imprisonment:
 Messrs Dawad Mahomed, Parsee Rustomjee, M. C. Anglia, Shapurji Randeria, Sorabji Shapurji, Azam Sedu Patel—all these have been sentenced to three months each—and Messrs Kazi Kalamian Dadamian, Omar Osman, Mulji Uka Mayavasi, Ibrahim Hoosen, Ismail Essop, Vally Amodji Randerwala, Mohanlal Parmananddas Killawala, Harishanker Ishwar Joshi, Mohanlal Narbheram Goshalia, Surendrarai Bapubhai Medh and Umiyashanker Manchharam Shelat, each serving a six-week term.
 The following 19 persons are awaiting trial. Instead of applying for bail, they are refreshing themselves in gaol:
 Messrs Mavji Karsanji Kothari, Ratanshi Mulji Sodha, Khatri Damodar Durlabh Gandevi, Khatri Dahya Narasi, Zinabhai Vallabhbhai Ugi, Bhikhabhai Kalyanji Ugi, Lalbhai Nathubhai, Vasanji Lalbhai, Moonsami Elleri, Mulji Ratanji, Hira Mulji, Raghavji Ragunath Mehta, Ravikrishna Talevantsingh, Davji Ahmed, Karsan Jogi, Lakshman Vartachalan, Morar Makan, Pakiri Naidoo and M. K. Gandhi.
 From among these, Mr. Mavji Karsanji Kothari got himself released on bail only today, with everyone’s consent, and left for the town. The object is to have a close watch kept on the trains arriving from Durban. It appears that three Madrasis have applied in Charlestown for submission to the Act. Since it was felt necessary that such persons should be acquainted with the true position, it was  decided to apply for bail for Mr. Mavji. After he is imprisoned, some other arrangement will have to be made.
 
 ‘‘RAMZAN SHARIF’’
 All the Muslim prisoners are duly observing the Ramzanlibtech_416_footnote. Mr. Kazi brings them food specially prepared for the purpose. The Governor [of the prison] has granted special permission for this. Permission has also been granted for keeping a clock and a light in their cell. All of them are particular about the  namazlibtech_417_footnote, and pass the time cheerfully.
 WORK IN GAOL
 Those who are observing  rozalibtech_418_footnotelibtech_419_footnoteand other Indians as   well  are being given very little work for the present. Mr. Shelat and Mr. Medh work as cooks. The rest engage themselves in cleaning the cells or such other miscellaneous work, which they do not find hard  or  difficult in any way. If anyone is found to be ill, he is totally exempted from work. All the officers, including the gaoler, behave well. One need not take off one’s cap, but may only salute. This is a mere trifle. Taking off the head-gear is more convenient for those who wear a hat. But I am reporting this just to show that even in a matter like this, the officers do not harass anyone. Orders have been issued permitting the Parsees to wear their customary shirt and sacred thread as well as their own cap.
 PRISON DIET
 By way of food, one gets mealie pap in the morning, plenty of rice with a green vegetable (such as cabbage, etc.) for the midday meal, and rice in the same quantity with beans in the evening. Since food is cooked by the prisoners themselves, it is quite eatable. Apart from the nuisance of mealie pap, this diet can be considered deficient only in respect of ghee. The regulations here do not provide for any ghee or fat to Indians. A complaint has therefore been made to the physician, and he has promised to look into it. So there is reason to hope that the inclusion of ghee will be ordered. Most of the prisoners take mealie pap—some more, some less.
 FASTING
 Mr. Ratanshi Sodha, however, does not eat anything. He and the other Indians with him joined [us] on Wednesday. He ate something on the train on Wednesday, after which he had nothing, except a small
 
 quantity of groundnut once. He has been fasting thus just to please himself. He intends to miss a few more meals. He does not show that he dislikes the food served here. He is only making an experiment to find out how long he can fast.
 GAOL BUILDING
 Indians are so happy in gaol that one should think of it only as  a palace. It is well built, too. It is constructed of stone. The cells are large. Ventilation is satisfactory. There is an open courtyard in the middle, with a flooring of black stone. For bathing there are three showers. Water pours out of these in large quantities, enabling one to have a very good bath. Under-trial prisoners are given bread and sugar in addition. The courtyard is covered with a  barbed-wire  netting. In spite of strict arrangements, two Negroes once escaped by breaking through the tin roof. Hence, there is now a strong iron ceiling.
 DEPORTED
 Messrs Zinabhai Vallabhbhai, Bhikha Kalyan and Mahomed Hoosen were ordered to be deported. Before they were deported yesterday, they were unnecessarily locked up in the gaol for 13 days. Of these, Mr. Zinabhai and Mr. Bhikhabhai returned as soon as they were put across the border. They spent the night yesterday in the Volksrust police station. They were welcomed here today. As for Mr. Mahomed Hoosen Konkani, he got cold feet and stuck  to  Charlestown.
 SORABJI AND AZAM
 These two have become seasoned with long terms of imprisonment. They were deported today at 3 o’clock,  for  no apparent reason. However, they were to return the moment they were put on the other side, so that the affair will turn out to be merely a joke on the part of the Government.
 Sunday [October 11, 1908]
 Both these brave soldiers of India who have fought many a battle returned as soon as they reached the other side. The moment they were put across, they jumped over into the Transvaal without so much as a second’s interval, were arrested by the same gentleman who had gone with them to put them across the border, and again entered King Edward’s Hotel. All the Indians of Charlestown had turned up to receive them. They were disappointed. They did not even have the
 opportunity to arrange a party for them. The poor Chinaman, who was deported along with Mr. Sorabji and Mr. Azam, was dragged away by a Charlestown officer. This shows that Indians have risen in the estimation of others. The whites do feel a little afraid of them. The court can do nothing to the Chinaman, and the Immigration Officer has no authority to restrain him.

HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT:
 Your petitioners are prisoners at His Majesty’s gaol at Volksrust either serving imprisonment or awaiting trial.
Your petitioners are British Indians.
 Your petitioners find on perusing the diet scale for British  Indians that no fat is at all supplied with their food.
 The scale consists merely of mealie pap, vegetables and rice for convicted prisoners, bread being added to the above for prisoners awaiting trial.
 Your petitioners find that natives are regularly supplied with fat and Europeans with meat which contains the requisite amount of fat.libtech_421_footnote
 In the humble opinion of your petitioners, the diet supplied to British Indian prisoners is medically deficient by reason of  the  absence of fat in the Indian diet scale.
 Moreover, your petitioners for religious reasons are unable to take animal food or fat prepared from meat,libtech_422_footnoteand therefore, on meat
 
 days remain without or its substitute.libtech_423_footnote
 Your petitioners have often complained of the above deficiency but owing to the advent of a large number of other Indians, the hardship has become serious.libtech_424_footnote
Your petitioners therefore pray that
 ghee 	may be added 	to the 	ordinary Indian scale and  a 	vegetarian substitute 	in the shape of lentils 	or green 	vegetables may 	be authorised 	for meat 	on meat days. 
 Your petitioners further pray that should permission of the Director of Prisons be deemed necessary, you will be pleased to telegraph or telephone the contents hereof for the requested relief.

 [VOLKSRUST GAOL,
 October 13, 1908] Since I shall have no opportunity of writing for Indian Opinion during the time I shall be serving a sentence of imprisonment, I take
the liberty of addressing a few words to satyagrahis and other Indians.
 
 “Your petitioners who are Mahomedans have been graciously permitted during the past few days, it being their fasting month, to receive food from outside. “Owing to the said permission, the hardship due to the absence of fat and a substitute for meat has been confined to a few.
“But now by reason of the advent of many more, the difficulty has become serious.”
 Those who are outside carry a greater responsibility than those in gaol. In fact, the real trouble will have to be faced by those who want to serve sincerely from outside. The hardships of gaol life are mostly imaginary. Here I find everyone as happy as a bird the whole day long. The occasional harassment by inconsiderate officers can be remedied immediately. I hope therefore that no Indian will fight shy on going to gaol for the sake of the motherland.
 Satyagraha is both easy and difficult. I think it should be easy by now for everyone to see that every grievance can be remedied if we make it a point to follow nothing but the truth. It is  difficult  to observe truth—to suffer in order to put an end to suffering. And yet, the more I think, the more I see that there is no other way than that of satyagraha for us to fight our ills and those of others. I even feel that the world has no other really effective remedy to offer. Be that as it may, we at least have realized that it is better to win  through satyagraha. Consequently, I am hopeful that, if all the Indians persevere and carry through what they have begun, we shall have earned afresh the title of “brave pioneers”libtech_427_footnote
 Let us constantly remind ourselves that all the nations that have risen high have braved extreme suffering. If we want to rise high, we must adopt the same means.
 We must realize what a heavy responsibility we have assumed by sending the Natal businessmen to gaol. It is not too much that, following them, we should embrace poverty. They have not gone [to gaol] to serve their own interests.
 Every Indian who goes to gaol must realize that he expects to serve no personal interests thereby. He should know that even after having been to gaol, he may not remain in the Transvaal. Everyone must sacrifice his own interests in order to safeguard those of the community, uphold its honour and its good name.
 This campaign knows no distinctions of Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians, Bengalis, Madrasis, Gujaratis, Punjabis and others. All of us
 
 are Indians, and are fighting for India. Those who do not realize this are not servants but enemies of the motherland.

118,"October 14, 1908",TULSIDASA’S “RAMAYANA”libtech_428_footnote,"
        
 [Before October 14, 1908]
 A SUMMARY
 These days India’s sons go abroad in large numbers. In  a foreign country, not everyone can be conscious always of his particular religion. This is especially so in the case of Hindus. The present writer is of the view that it is the duty not merely of the Hindus alone but also of all Indians to acquaint themselves with the essentials of Hinduism in its common form.
 Hinduism, in its general spirit, is a religion which everyone will find acceptable. It is essentially an ethical religion. From this point of view, it may be said that all religions are equally true, since there can be no religion divorced from ethics.
 Be that as it may, the general spirit of Hinduism is most vividly reflected in the Ramayana. The original Ramayana is in Sanskrit. Few people read it. It has been translated into many languages of the world.  The  work  [also]  exists  in  all  the  prakritslibtech_429_footnotelibtech_430_footnoteof   India.   If   we examine all these translations, none can equal the Hindi Ramayana by Tulsidasa. Really speaking, Tulsidasa’s work is not a translation. His devotion to God was so profound that instead  of translating,  he poured forth his own heart. Apart from Madras, there is hardly any part of India where we find a single Hindu totally ignorant of Tulsidasa’s Ramayana. This wonderful work, however, is not read in
 
 languages of Northern and Central India. Here the word is used for the regional langu- ages of India
 its entirety by everyone settled in a foreign land (not  even  by everyone in India). There is no time to do so. If such works are published in an abridged form, they may prove beneficial to  the Indian people. With this idea in mind, it has been decided to bring out an abridgement to Tulsidasa’s Ramayna. The first canto of the book will shortly be before the public. It is not our intention that this abridged version should be used as a substitute for the original Ramayana [of Tulsidasa]. The object rather is that, after reading the shorter version, those who have time on their hands and who are saturated with love of God may go on to the  original.  The abridgement does not leave out any portion of the main narrative. But interpolations, long descriptions and some portion from the subsidiary parts have been omitted.
 We wish that every Indian goes devoutly through the summary which we are placing before the public, reflect over it, and assimilate the ethical principles so vividly set out in it. We shall consider our effort to have been duly rewarded if this abridged Ramayana is read in every Indian home in the evenings and during periods of leisure at other times.
 The other cantos will be published as their printing proceeds. They can be got bound together in the end. The price has been deliberately kept as low as possible, with a view to placing the work within the reach of every Indian.
 It is the duty of every Indian to know the Hindi script and language. There is hardly any other book as helpful as the Ramayana for a study of the general form of that language.

 [Before October 14, 1908] It appears our struggle is drawing to a conclusion, for the Govern-ment	is   resorting	to	more	oppressive   measures.	The
deportation of Mr. Sorabji and Mr. Azam, their immediate return, the
 swiftness with which sentences were passed on them, the sentences of imprisonmentagainst 58 Indians in Barberton, their deportation—all this shows that the Government is coming to the end of its tether. Its
 resources are getting exhau-sted. It is using up all its ammunition. But it should be remembered that things become very difficult as we near the end, and that the last stage is always hard to go through. All other difficulties can be borne, but they must be heroic souls indeed who can face the difficulties of the last stage. We therefore hope  that Indians will not be deterred even by these.

 [Before October 14, 1908] Some Indians in the Transvaal, Natal and other parts of South Africa  have  become  confirmed  addicts  to   drink.  Not   only  is  this
against religion, but it has also a debilitating effect both on body and
 mind. It will be difficult for those who have formed this evil habit to join the satyagraha campaign. We do not wish to write about the evils of drinking. Much has been written about the subject already. We shall only say that those who have formed this harmful habit should strive to get rid of it. If not, they will bring unnecessary suffering to others; and very often they will find themselves unable to give their services to a good cause, however much they may wish.

These, then, are my thoughts:  	The struggle in the Transvaal is not without its interest for India. 	We are engaged in raising men who will give a good account of 	themselves in any part of the world. We have undertaken the struggle 	on the following assumptions:   Passive 		Resistance is always 		infinitely superior to 		physical force.  There 		is no 		inherent barrier 		between Europeans 		and Indians anywhere.  Whatever 		may have been the 		motives of 		the British 		rulers in 		India, there is 		a desire 		on the 		part of the 		nation at 		large to 		see that justice 		is done. 		It would 		be a 		calamity to 		break the 		connection between the 		British people and 		the people of 		India. If 		we are treated 		as, or 		assert our 		right to 		be treated as, 		free men, whether in 		India or elsewhere, 		the connection between 		the British 		people and the people 		of India 		can not only 		be mutually 		beneficial, but is 		calculated to be of enormous 		advantage to the 		world religiously, and, 		therefore, socially and 		politically. In 		my opinion, each nation 		is the 		complement of 		the other.   	Passive Resistance in connection with the Transvaal struggle I 	should hold justifiable on the strength of any of these 	propositions. It      
 may be a slow remedy, but I regard it as an absolutely sure remedy, not only for our ills in the Transvaal, but for all the political and other troubles from which our people suffer in India.

 "
123,"October 14, 1908",TRIAL OF DAWJEE AMOD AND OTHERSlibtech_435_footnote,"
        
 [VOLKSRUST,
 October 14, 1908] On Wednesday last, before Mr. De Villiers, A.R.M., Mr. Mentz prosecuting, Dawjee Amod was charged as a prohibited immigrant for entering the Colony without
having previously made application under the new Registration Act (No. 36 of 1908)
 from outside the Colony. Mr. Gandhi defended, and pleaded not guilty. Accused had previously entered the Colony, producing a permit and registration certificate and had been arrested. He had afterwards promised to leave the Colony and apply for registration under the new Act from Natal, but when Corporal Cameron had shown him the form of application, he had refused to leave the Colony, and was re-arrested.
 In cross-examination, Corporal Cameron admitted that the accused did not fall within sub-sections 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of section 2 of the Immigration Act, nor was there any removal order against him. He had no reason to suppose the documents produced were not the lawful property of the accused.
 Mr. Gandhi said that accused could choose to enter under the unrepealed Asiatic Act, No. 2 of 1907, and that he could not be a prohibited immigrant when he produced his permit. He did not come under sub-section 4 of section 2 of the Immigration Act.
 The Magistrate found the accused guilty, but said he appeared to have been influenced not to leave the Colony. Accused was sentenced to pay a fine of £15 or go to gaol with hard labour for one month.
 Karson Jogi and eight others, including two minors, were similarly charged. They were similarly sentenced, except Hirji Mulji, a boy of about 12 years, who was sentenced to pay a fine of £5 or go to jail without hard labour for 14 days.
 Ratanji Sodha, Mawji Karsonji, Ravikrishna Talwantsingh, and Ratanji Rugnath were also charged as prohibited immigrants, pleading not guilty. The first three claimed to enter the Colony under the education test, whilst the first two and Ratanji Rugnath claimed pre-war residence. Mawji Karsonji claimed also to enter as an ex-member of His Majesty’s Volunteer Forces, holding a medal issued to him for services rendered during the Boer War. Ravikrishna was born in South Africa.
 Giving evidence on behalf of the accused, Mr. Gandhi said he took the sole responsibility for having advised them to enter the Colony. They had largely been
 
 influenced by his advice, though no doubt they had used their own judgment. He thought that, in giving that advice, he had consulted the best interests of the State.
 Cross-examined: He asked accused to enter at a public meeting  and individually. They probably, at that time, had no idea of entering the Colony, except, perhaps, one of them. He would certainly admit that he had assisted the accused to enter. He admitted aiding and abetting them to enter the Transvaal. He was quite prepared to suffer the consequences of his action, as he always had been.
 The accused were found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine of £20 or go to gaol with hard labour for six weeks.
 Daya Narsi was then charged for refusing to give his thumb-print under the new Registration Act, though he had produced his permit. He had given his [finger-] impressions at the gaol (under the gaol regulations), where he had already been awaiting trial for a week. He was sentenced to a fine of £10 or imprisonment with hard labour for one month, as was Moonsamy Ellary, who was similarly charged.
 Bhikhabhai and Jhinabhai, who had been deported on Friday and had returned at once, were charged as prohibited immigrants. They were sentenced to a fine of £20 or 6 weeks’ hard labour.

 [VOLKSRUST,
 October 14, 1908]
 Mr. Gandhi himself was then charged with failing to give his thumb- and finger-impressions upon demand, under the new Act. He pleaded guilty. He produced no documents, and when asked to furnish means of identification as required by Regulation 9, he refused.
 Giving evidence, Mr. Gandhi said:
 In connection with my refusal to produce my registration certificate and to give thumb impressions or finger impressions, I think that, as an officer of this Court, I owe an explanation. There have been differences between the Government and British Indians whom I represent as Secretary of the British Indian. Association, over the Asiatic Act, No. 2 of 1907, and after due deliberation, I took upon myself the responsibility of advising my countrymen not to submit to the primary obligation imposed by the Act; but still, as law-abiding subjects of the State, to accept its sanctions Rightly or wrongly, in common with other Asiatics, I consider that the Act  in  question, among other things, offends our conscience, and the only way, I
 
 thought, as I still think, the Asiatics could show their feeling with regard to it was to incur its penalties. And in pursuance of that policy,  I admit that I have advised the accused who have preceded me to refuse submission to the Act, as also the Act 36 of 1908, seeing that, in the opinion of British Indians, full relief that was promised by the Government has not been granted. I am now before the Court to suffer the penalties that may be awarded to me. I wish to thank the prosecution and the public for having extended to me the ordinary courtesies.
 Mr. Mentz thought that a difference should be made in this case; as Mr. Gandhi had admitted his sin to be greater than that of the others, he asked that the heaviest penalty (£100 or three months with hard labour) should be awarded.
 The Magistrate found Mr. Gandhi guilty. In giving judgment, he remarked that it was not for him to consider the question of religious objections. He had only to administer the law. There had been a general defiance of the law. He felt very sorry to see Mr. Gandhi in that position today, but he must make a difference between him and the others. He sentenced Mr. Gandhi to pay a fine of £25 or go to jail with hard labour for two months.
 Of course, no fines have been paid, and all have smilingly gone to jail, Mr.
 Gandhi being especially happy.

 My only desire is that everyone should remain steadfast and ever refuse to violate his pledge, however long the struggle lasts, whether eight days or eight months or eight years, or even longer. We ought not to bring any pressure on those who may yield and desert the movement. If anyone does, I shall believe that he does not understand the nature of the movement. If the struggle has become drawn out so long, we are ourselves the reason for that. If we make a conscious effort to remove the causes, everything can be over even today.

131,"December 12, 1908",SPEECH AT JOHANNESBURG RECEPTION,"
        
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 December 12, 1908]
 Mr. Chairman, delegates from Natal, My Tamil brethren and other friends,
 I see you today after two months and ten days. I feel as if I was outside all the time and not in gaol. It is today that I think I have entered a prison. Those who are outside have a more important duty to discharge than those in gaol. So long as people who are outside do not exert themselves more vigorously, our bonds are not likely to snap. When the station-master at Volksrust congratulated me on my release, I told him also that it was really on that day that I found myself in prison, and that I was now facing much heavier tasks than those assigned to me while in gaol.
 In a country where people suffer injustice and oppression and are denied their legitimate rights, their real duty lies in suffering imprisonment. And further, so ‘long as the bonds that’ bind us have not been snapped, I think it is better that we spend our days in gaol. This, I think, is the true meaning of religion for those who have faith in God.
 I want to say a few words about the scene that was witnessed at the station today. My services have pleased the community. You have assembled today in such a large number because you wish to express your appreciation of my having worked for a day at breaking stones, of my having suffered imprisonment and of the other things that I did. Where there is God there is truth, and where there is truth there is God. I live in fear of God. I love truth only, and so God is with me. Even if the path of truth does not please the community, it pleases God. Therefore I will do what pleases God, even if the community should turn against me. The enthusiasm that was in evidence today was heartening enough. It shows that all of you, like others who could not be present, approve of the satyagraha campaign that we have launched. I have said at Standerton, Heidelberg and other places that the outcome of our campaign does not depend upon whether we win or lose in the Supreme Court. We should rather, if need be, bear separation from our families, sacrifice our property for the sake of truth, endure whatever other hardships we may encounter and thus make the voice of truth heard in the Divine Court. When the echoes of that voice strike the ears of General Smuts, his conscience will be stirred and he will acknowledge our rights, will see that we invite
 
 suffering in order to secure them, that we have suffered more than enough. It is then that we shall get what we have been demanding. It is not the Imperial Government that will secure you your rights; you will get them only from God. If you fight truthfully with Him as witness, your bonds will be loosened in eight days according to your Chairman, but in less than 24 hours according to me. God is present everywhere; He sees and hears everything. I am sure that we shall be free when that God stirs their [our opponents’] conscience. We do not sacrifice as much as we should. The moment we do so, our fetters will fall away. I shall say more tomorrow. Today I have nothing more to say. I thank all the friends who have assembled here today. I want them to inscribe my words in their hearts and to pray to God that He may make everyone feel the same as I do.libtech_444_footnote

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 December 13, 1908]
 I said yesterday that we had won. We have won because of the sufferings of our people. A community, 1,500 members of which have been to gaol, must certainly be considered to have emerged victorious. That out of a population of 7,000 as many as 1,500 have been to gaol must surely, I think, be counted as a victory. As things are reckoned in this world, it can be said that there has been no victory, because we have not yet secured what we demanded from the Government. The Chairman said that, as I was the leader of the community, you should do my bidding. But that is not right. It is my duty to place before you what I think and what I hear, and to do what you tell me. It is for you to decide whether or not to act upon my suggestions. We are still half-hearted about everything, and therefore never do anything in time. When we become punctual, we shall be able to attend to everything without loss of time. I place two things before you. The first phase of  the   struggle  commenced  with  Ram
 
 Sundar, the second with Sorabji.libtech_446_footnotelibtech_447_footnoteWhat I wrote to Sorabji I wrote to others as well. The first reply I received was from Sorabji. I did not know him as well as I did Ram Sundar, and I was doubtful whether he would hold firm till the last moment. Personally, I take everyone at his word. The community knows what Sorabji has done. There were 75 prisoners with me in the Volksrust gaol; among them all I observed Sorabji to be the mildest, the most even-tempered and steadfast. He put up with everything that people said to him. Living with him, I have very well realized his worth.
 Next, from among the Imam Saheb, Moosa Essakji and the two Madrasis who had received six weeks’ imprisonment, I spent more time with the Imam Saheb. I used to feel concerned how he would be able, with his [poor] health and physique, to withstand the strain. But I saw that he endured all difficulties and performed every task. The Hamidia Islamic Society and the community are fortunate that the Society has a chairman like him. Once, when the gaoler asked for some men to go with him to mow grass, no one responded. Imam Saheb felt that it was our duty [to go]. When he got up, others started remonstrating with the gaoler, saying that he was an Imam and should not be put to work. They all rather felt ashamed on this occasion. Such habits of ours are also responsible for our struggle being  prolonged. After the release of others, a few of us were left behind. Moosa Essakji took charge of cooking. The Emam Saheb agreed to help him. They used to get up at three o’clock in the morning and start the cooking. Because the community has such men among it, I believe that it has come out victorious. I strongly advise those who go to gaol that while there they must obey the gaol regulations. If everyone acts in the name of God, our fetters will fall away in no time. We are certainly not fighting on behalf of those who hold forged permits. The struggle is no longer what it was before. The fight is now only to uphold the honour of the millions who live in India. The Imperial Government is seeking ways and means of expelling Indians from South Africa. They want us to go and settle in regions with a bad climate. I therefore think it very important that we convince the Government of our courage. We are not to fight now for men who have no legitimate claims but we can live honourably if educated men, men who can teach us the right things. come in. So long as we do not understand even this, we cannot hope to win. I see that some men hanker after publicity. Why should they have such notions? To those
 
 who wish to serve, Who rely on God, what does it matter whether they get publicity or not? A true satyagrahi does not care for it. He merely works. The Natal gentlemen have promised me that they will be with us till the struggle comes to an end. I want the three leaders to reiterate that promise today. It has made me very happy to know that they have collected a very large amount and that all the gentlemen [approached by them] responded to their appeals without reserve. Of the four resolutions that were passed at the last mass meetinglibtech_448_footnotelibtech_449_footnote, the second was explained to everyone by Mr. Cama. I explain it again today. It was resolved, in the name of God, to continue the struggle till the Government did justice. If the pledge was taken after full deliberation, everyone  may  please  raise  his  handlibtech_450_footnotelibtech_451_footnote.  We  are   here   in   the   sacred premises of a mosque. Please remember that you have raised your hands in such a place in the name of God. Sheth Rustomjee sent [me] a book on religion for reading in gaol. It says that the righteous are dear to God. The pledge you took on oath in the name of God you must have taken after full deliberation. Is there any reason, then why you should not win? The scriptures of all religions declare: “I give unto those that are with me all they ask for.” The Government may take your wealth or imprison your body, but it cannot deprive you of your soul. If you do in the right spirit what I have asked you to do, you will get not merely the two things you have demanded, but whatever else you want. The echoes of this campaign have already been heard in India and in the rest of the world. See that the campaign is intensified.
 [Gandhiji was then garlanded on behalf of the Hamidia Islamic Society. Speaking again. he said:]
 I take this to be a diamond necklace, offered not out of respect merely but out of love. It is with that feeling that I thank you. Dawad Sheth’s son, a mere child, writes from England to know why we are not united. The Hamidia Islamic Society is an institution of Muslims. I take it as a great honour that I have been garlanded on its behalf. If both the eyes, Hindus and Muslims, remain unharmed, you will prosper. If 13,000 Indians continue the fight in the name of God and if the two communities remain united, you will also be the masters of India. What is happening here will have its repercussions out there and all people will be united.

134,"December 18, 1908",TRIAL OF THE NAIDOOS AND OTHERSlibtech_455_footnote,"
        
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 December 18, 1908] Upon several Indians, it is said, proceeding to the registration office on Von Brandis square yesterday morning (the 18th instant) in order to comply with Act 36 of
1908,   the   office   was  immediately   picketed   by   “   passive” resisters,   says  The
 transvaal Leader. The police were sent for, and soon after their arrival they arrested four members of the picket, amongst whom was C.K.T. Naidoo. The places of the four men were taken by four others, who, in turn, were arrested. A crowd of Indians collected; further arrests were made, and eventually about 27 Indians were charged with having refused to produce registration certificates and to give signatures and impressions of thumbs and fingers.
 Later in the day, the arrested Indians were removed for trial to Government Square. The news of their detention had got abroad and, when Mr. Gandhi arrived to conduct the defence, he was escorted by about 200 compatriots.
 The first quartette charged consisted of C.K.T. [Naidoo], L.R.[Naidoo] and L.D. Naidoo and A.V. Chetty. Pleas of “ Not guilty” were entered.
 Mr. Samuels, who prosecuted for the Crown, said that the charge was on the lines of that in the Randeria case. The circumstances were the same and the question was whether the Crown should proceed pending the result of Randeria’s appeal.
 
 V. Chetty was published in Indian Opinion under the title: “Pickets Arrested—Leaders Before the Court.”
 MR. JORDAN: Why have they been arrested?
 MR. SAMUELS: They have been arrested upon instructions received and, it is alleged, they have been acting as pickets and causing trouble amongst Asiatics who are desirous of complying with the law. I make this statement  ex-parte, and  possibly it is not correct.
 Mr. Jordan said that such conduct, if report were true, was most serious. The statement seemed “ to lend the colour of truth to statements upon oath made before me  by Indians to the effect that they are frightened to register because of these pickets. Many of the men who have been charged before me have told me that they have been terrorised and now I begin to believe their stories.”
 MR. GANDHI: If these men in the dock have been terrorising Indians anxious to comply with the law, surely there is some section amongst the Statutes for the contravention of which they can be charged. But why charge them under this section 9 of Act 36 of 1908? The watching will go on so long as the struggle continues. If these men have been terrorising others, then they should be punished, but my learned friend, Mr. Samuels, says he hardly credits the story.
 MR. JORDAN: Men upon oath have told me that they have been terrorised by compatriots.
 MR. GANDHI: Some people will say anything.
 MR. JORDAN: And I’m afraid it will continue so long as your friends are permitted to do what you glibly term “ watching.” (Laughter)
 MR. GANDHI: Anyway, these four men can’t be charged under this section, because there is no Registrar of Asiatics according to law.
 MR. JORDAN: Oh! Then what’s the use of your picketing if Indians cannot get registered?
 MR. GANDHI: We only want to let those who forget their manhood know that there is such a thing as ostracism.
 MR. JORDAN: I don’t think it is ostracism. I think it is a wholesome fear of incurring grievous bodily harm.
 MR. GANDHI: Then 500 would not have registered and been living upon the best of terms with the rest of the community and  be supplying part of the sinews of war today.
 MR. JORDAN: All right; the accused are remanded, sine die.
 MR. GANDHI: If there is any terrorism brought into play, if it is brought to the notice of the officers of the Association, they will do all they can to help the Government.
 The other Indians under arrest were similarly remanded.

135,,MIGHTY STRUGGLE,"
        
 It is growing clearer every day that this is indeed a mighty struggle that is being carried on in the Transvaal. The Act must, of course, be repealed. Undoubtedly, this is an important demand. But as time passes, we have the advantage of being able to understand the real nature of the conflict. We have stated earlier that the Transvaal Indians are not fighting merely against the Transvaal Government; they are fighting against the Imperial Government as well. We have also stated that it is not as if the Transvaal Indians were fighting for themselves alone; they are fighting on behalf of all Indians in South Africa, on behalf of all Indians abroad; in fact, they are fighting for the whole of India. We have recently received support for this view from England. We give elsewhere summaries of a speech by Colonel Seely and Mr. Ritch’s reply to it. Colonel Seely’s statements in that speech deserve notice. He says that Indians must not migrate to a region with a good climate. The Coloured peoples and the whites cannot mix with each other and both stand to suffer by such mix-ing. Indians [he says] are rice-eaters and the whites cannot successfully compete with them. These statements express the views of the Imperial Government. They mean only one thing, namely, that in their view Indians are good enough to work merely as slaves of whites. Colonel Seely went on to saw that Indians already settled in the Transvaal and in other Colonies should be allowed to live honourably, saying, in the same breath, that General Botha was right in the policy he was following. Colonel Seely is therefore hypocritical when he says that we should be treated honourably. His speech in fact implies that Indians residing in lands where whites had already settled should be gradually eliminated. The Transvaal Indians therefore  have  to shoulder a burden on behalf of the whole of India. We shall show later that they can easily do so, and they certainly will. Colonel Seely’s views suggest a change [for the worse] in British policy.  They represent a rather unworthy aspect of British policy and, if they gain currency, they will herald the decline of the Empire, Therefore, the Indians’ resistance tends to the good of the British Empire, too.  Colonel Seely’s views will be endorsed only by those who wish that the British Empire should be destroyed, All the Colonists belong to that class. They are therefore enemies of the British Empire. Indian [passive] resisters, who have been opppsing this view and will continue to do so, may be said to be friends of the Empire.
 If our readers consider the matter in this light, they will easily see that the Transvaal struggle is not merely for permits, of no value in
 themselves, nor for the entry of a handful of Indians. It is a fight for a noble cause. It is a battle of principles. Indians have pitted themselves against a mighty force. Even so, we make bold to say that it is possible for us to win. No one should imagine that this is like hoping that a black ant will carry on its head a potful of jaggery. The men who say this do not understand the efficacy of satyagraha—the power of truth. What can-not be done by millions can be done by a handful of men. We come acro-ss such instances everywhere. This is also true of the Transvaal Indians. It is because the Indians here are few that they can put up a good fight. It may take time to explain the position to most Indians, to convince them of the beauty of satyagraha, to stop dissensions amongst them. If, how-ever, the seed of truth strikes root in a few men and blossoms forth, its branches can be planted  elsewhere and the tree can thus be multiplied indefinitly. Let it not be imagined that mustard seeds cannot make a hill. This also is possible; in fact, it has often happened. That is the greatness of the Lord of this universe. The hill is made up of nothing but particles of earth. If one were to inquire how this came about, one would simply feel incredulous. And yet we know that the thing has happened. Not only do we believe that a few Indians can accomplish this task; we have also said that they can do so quite easily. Why do we say this? As the satya- graha campaign progresses, we see that it is the poor alone who can join it. The rich find the burden of their wealth too heavy; they are not able to carry the burden of truth. This means that the Transvaal Indians must embrace poverty. To think that this is impossible is to give up the effort in despair. In what way is this difficult? We can never rely on wealth. We may even be robbed of it. Therefore, let us ourselves renounce it and instead take the sword of truth in our hands. If we have the strength to think and act thus, we are bound to get what we have been demanding. We have already said that the fight will certainly be carried on. Is there any reason to believe that it will not be? We find that the community on the whole is united. Hundreds of Indians have been, as it were, sanctified through anointment in prisons, They have seen the beauty of gaol life and that are not likely to turn back. And most of the Transvaal Indians are in any case poor, so that the question of their retreating simply does not arise.  We  place Colonel Seely’s speech before such Indians and beg of them not to be defrauded, while they live, of the glory of such a mighty battle, but win immortal fame for themselves—for India—throughout the world.

137,,BALANCE-SHEET,"
        
 The year, according to the English calendar, is drawing to a close. In our present state, we attach less importance to our own than to the English calendar. We plan our affairs with reference to the English or European calendar. We do not wish to suggest that this state of affairs is deplorable in itself. But as things stand, it is a sign of our degradation. The same thing would hardly have been regarded as unusual if we were really free, Since we want to have good relations with all parts of the world, nothing will be wrong in our following the European calender for the convenience of all. However, this is a digression. The object of this article is to set out the balance-sheet for the year.
 Examining conditions in Natal, we find that the Government of the Colony wanted to enact many laws directed against us. But the Imperial Government did not sanction them. A commission has been appointed to consider the question of the continued import of inden- tured labour, There is every possibility of some good coming out of it. But the disallowance of the Bills should give us no reason to be particularly happy. Considering its internal difficulties, the [Natal Indian] Congress has done well. But those who manage its affairs must give thought to its continued financial difficulties. There is  not  enough enthusiasm among the people. Trade is ruined. Owing to a fall in land prices, many Indians have been reduced to poverty. Even servants are put to hardship. Cases of murders among Indians are on

 the increase. The police feel helpless and Indians appear incapable of self-defence. This is an illustration of the fact that Indians are not free, do not even deserve to be free, for they depend on others for the safety of their lives and property. There is lack of education for the mind. On the one hand, the Government is withdrawing  the educational facilities; the higher-grade schools are in a bad way. On the other hand, we ourselves do nothing for our education. We do not even mind losing a library. The only happy feature in the midst of all this is that some young men have been sent by their  parents  to England for education. The parents at least have thus done their duty. But no one can say whether the final product will be an earthen pot or  a brass pot. Just now, the potter’s wheel is at work.
 Things seem quiet in the Cape. Whatever opportunities Indians have there are being thrown away. There are two rival bodies, engaged in mutual bickerings. The situation is likely to be exploited for its own advantage by the third party, their common enemy. The trading law and the immigration law there bear hard [on the Indians]. There, too, the internal situation is rather pitiable.
 Rhodesia was threatened with a law similar to the Transvaal Act. The threat has not disappeared altogether, but there is little possibility of the Imperial Government sanctioning such a law.
 The condition of Delagoa Bay Indians is as bad as the climate there. The Indian community is slumbering. There is no one to challenge the laws enacted. People there seem to think that, so long as their business is good and they make money, nothing else matters.
 There are no Indians in the Orange River Colony to speak of. There has been no change in the situation there. It depends on Indians when a change will come about.
 The Transvaal appears to hold the cards for all. That the Natal and Rhodesian Bills were disallowed was due principally, it may be said, to the Transvaal campaign. The campaign has now assumed a form which has won for it the admiration of the entire world. The prestige of the Indian community has gone up. In India, meetings are being held in every town over the transvaal. A [public] discussion has been going on in England. Within the space of twelve months, nearly 2,000 Indians have gone to gaol. People have been display- ing great courage in facing hardships, and their campaign is being acclaimed one every side. They have found a new weapon and acquired a new strength. We have not yet fully realized the miraculous quality of this strength and this weapon. General Smuts played foul, but since the Indians were satyagrahis, his foul play has turned out to their advantage. Such is the marvellous power of truth. Falsehood pays
 homage to truth, for falsehood cannot hold out against it. Moreover, as the struggle is being prolonged, people are growing more determined, [whereas] other modes of fighting have always the effect of wearying the people. Similarly, service of truth can never lead to weakness. The more one puts oneself in its service, the stronger one grows.

138,"December 28, 1908",LETTER TO MAGANLAL GANDHI,"
        
 Monday night [December 28, 1908]libtech_458_footnote
CHI. MAGANLAL,
 Your letters to hand. Jagatsingh’s is a regrettable case. As I see it, it is more the fault of the Hindus. It was particularly their duty which they have failed to discharge.
 One should not be carried away by Jagatsingh’s brahmacharya. Lakshman and Indrajit were both celebates (brahmacharis) and had conquered sleep and were therefore equally valorous. But the valour of the former was divine, while that of the latter ungodly. This means that the vow of brahmacharya and other vows are holy and bring happiness only when they are taken as a spiritual  discipline.  If  resorted to by a demon, they only add to misery. This is a very serious statement to make; but all the same, it is no doubt true. Lord Patanjali has shown this very clearly in his Yogadarshanlibtech_459_footnotelibtech_460_footnote.  This is the thing our religion teaches us. The phrase madanugrahaya —‘for my favour’— deserves to be always borne in mind. If you do not follow what I say or if you have any doubt about it, please write to me.
 I am not surprised at your losing control over yourself. As you dive deeper into yourself and have experience, your mind will become calm, your passion will cool down and you will be stronger spiritually. Think carefully of every step you take or a piece of work you do, analyze it, always applying to it this test, namely, “Will this promote my spiritual progress?” The question “Will this lead to the progress of the Hindu religion or of India?” is covered by it. The country cannot rise, religions cannot advance by a step that will not lead to spiritual growth.
This has been found to be the result of the Swami’slibtech_461_footnotelibtech_462_footnoteimpatience.
 
 
 It is very regrettable. It was because of such results that the venerable Kavilibtech_463_footnoteoften used to say that in modern times we should beware of religious teachers. Our experience also confirms his view. Everyone is obdurate and wants to see his own opinion prevail. If instead of such obduracy in regard to one’s opinion one devotes one’s energy to self-realization, one will do good to oneself as well as to others. Otherwise, both will face degradation.
 Mrs. Polak will leave tomorrow. This letter also will reach you the same day, perhaps later, for you must have gone to Maritzburg.
More from other letters.

 "
139,,NEW YEAR,"
        
 We  examined   the   balance-sheet   of   the   last  year.libtech_464_footnoteWe  were unhappy at the thought that we had to follow an alien calendar in making our cal-culations. No cause for unhappiness would remain if swadeshi were to replace everything foreign. We can easily attain happiness if we exert our-selves to that end during the year that has just commenced. Swadeshi car-ries a great and profound meaning. It does not mean merely the use of what is produced in one’s own country. That meaning is certainly there in swadeshi. But there is another meaning implied in it which is far greater and much more important. Swadeshi means reliance on our own strength. We should also know what we mean by “ reliance on our own strength.” “Our strength” means the strength of our body, our mind and our soul. From among these, on which should we depend? The answer is brief. The soul is supreme, and therefore soul-force is the foundation on which man must build. Passive resistance or satyagraha is a mode of fighting which depends on such force. That, then, is the only real key[to success] for the Indians.
 During this year a good deal will depend on the Transvaal and Natal. The Transvaal fight is continuing. In Natal, the issue of licences will come up. If the Indians in the Transvaal give up their fight, that will have an immediate adverse effect in Natal, because the course of events in Natal during the coming year will largely be determined by this movement. Nothing will be gained by submitting petitions to the
 
 Natal Government. How, then, may anything be gained?  The Transvaal provides the answer to this. That is to say, the answer to the question as to what this year has in store for us will be provided by whether or not the Indians in the Transvaal fight to the last.
 It may be hoped that a community from among which 2,000 men have been to gaol will never accept defeat, though there may be some traitors in it. Looking at the matter in this light, every Indian will find that what the new year will bring lies entirely in his own hands.

 We have received many requests from parents for admission of their children to this school. We are prepared to undertake their schooling. There are some financial difficulties, however, in providing residential facilities for them. We are trying our best to overcome them. We hope to give more details about this in our next issue.
 In the meantime, those parents who want to send their children [to our school] may inform us accordingly. If they can also give as some idea of the monetary help they will be able to give, the matter will be settled soon.

141,,NATAL-BOUND INDIAN PASSENGERS,"
        
 Indian passengers arriving in Natal are facing more and more difficulties. The fault mainly is our own. Many of these people are rather impatient to enter [the Colony]. If they have no right to enter, that makes no difference to them. Others have to suffer  in consequence. If the fault is ours, surely the remedy also lies with us. Only when and to the extent that we develop a sense of justice will there be an end to our troubles. Anything else that we may do will be of no avail. It will prove as ineffective as an attempt to stitch a patch on the sky.libtech_465_footnote

142,,EXEMPLARY CASE OF SATYAGRAHA,"
        
 In Maritzburg, there is a white named Mr. Green. He refused to pay the poll-tax. So he was produce before a magistrate. He declared bluntly that, as it was an unjust tax, he was not willing to pay it. The Magistrate has sentenced him to imprisonment. Mr. Green is at present undergoing the sentence. This is an unusual case. Mr. Green does not incite others. He feels that the poll-tax is an oppressive impost. He is not much of an orator. He, therefore, resolved in his mind that so far as he was concerned, he would never pay that tax. He does not mind the sentence of imprisonment imposed on him in consequence. This is satyagraha in the true sense of the term. Those who love truth never follow others blindly. They go on suffering for the sake of truth.

143,,143 MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [-I ]libtech_466_footnote,"
 INTRODUCTORY
 I think my experience in gaol this time was better than  in January 1908. It was good education for me personally, and I believe it will prove useful to other Indians.
 A campaign of satyagraha can take many forms, but it is found that gaol-going is the most effective means of fighting political disabilities. We shall have to go to gaol often enough, I think; it is necessary not only during the present agitation, but is the only course that can be adopted in fighting future disabilities. It is the duty of every Indian, therefore, to know all that is worth knowing about gaol- life.
 ARRESTED
 When Mr. Sorabji was arrested, I wished what I could follow him to gaol, or that the agitation would end before he was due to be released. I was disappointed. The same desire came over me again more intensely, when the brave leaders of Natal went to gaol, and [this time] it was fulfilled. While returning from Durban, I was arrested at Volksrust Station on October 7 [1908] for being without my certificate of voluntary registration and refusing to give my finger-
 
 impressions.
 My object in going to Durban was to bring [along with me] educated Indians living in Natal and other Indians who had been previously resident in the Transvaal. I had hoped that quite a large number of Indians in Natal would show readiness to follow their  leaders [to gaol]. The Government also felt the same way. Accordingly, orders had been issued to the gaoler to make arrangements for the accommodation of more  than  a  hundred Indians, and tents, blankets, utensils, etc., had been sent on from Pretoria. I also found, as I alighted at Volksrust accompanied by several Indians, that a large number of policemen were present. But all this labour proved superfluous. The gaoler and the police were disappointed, for only a small number of Indians from Natal had offered to accompany me. There were just six in that train. Eight more started from Durban by another train on the same day. In all, therefore, only fourteen Indians came. All of us were arrested and taken to the lock-up. The next day we were produced before the Magistrate, but the hearing of the case was postponed for seven days. We declined to offer bail. Two days later, Mr Mavji Karsanji Kothari, who had joined [us] in spite of the fact that he was suffering from piles, was asked to bail himself out, as his trouble had become aggravated and there was need for a picket in Volksrust.
 SITUATION IN GAOL
 There were in gaol, when we arrived there, Mr.  Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Rustomjee, Mr. Anglia [and] Mr. Sorabji Adajania who had initiated the second phase of the movement, and about 25 other Indians. It being the Ramzan month, Muslim friend had been observing the raza. By special permission, food was sent to them in the evening by Mr. Essop Suleman Kazi. Due observance of the fast had thus been made possible. Though there is generally no provision for lighting in mofussil gaols, orders had been issued in view of the Ramzan to arrange for lights and provide a clock. Mr. Anglia led the namaz. Those who were observing the fast were subjected to hard labour during the first few days, but later on no hard labour was exacted from them.
 As for the other Indians, permission had been granted for one of them to attend to the cooking. This was done by  Mr. Umiyashanker Shelat and Mr. Surendrarai Medh, who were joined later by Mr. Joshi when the number of prisoners went up. When these gentlemen were deported, cooking was attended to by Mr. Ratanshi Sodha, Mr. Raghavji and Mr. Mavji Kothari, Later still, when the number rose very high, Mr. Lalbhai and Mr. Omar Osman also
 joined. Those in charge of cooking had to get up at two or three in the morning and keep busy till five or six in the evening. When a considerable number of Indians had already been released, Mr. Moosa Essakji and Imam Saheb Bawazeer took charge of cooking. I count it as the good fortune of the Indians concerned that they were served food prepared by the Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society and a businessman who had in fact had no experience of cooking. When the Imam Saheb and his companions were released, they left the legacy of cooking to me. Since I knew something of it, I experienced no difficulty. The work remained under my charge only for four days. It is now (that is, up to the moment of writing) being looked after by Mr. Harilal Gandhi. Though the information as to who was in charge of cooking when we arrived in gaol does not fall under the heading [of this paragraph], I have given it here for the sake of convenience.
 When we entered the gaol, Indians were lodged in three bed- rooms. In this gaol, Indian and Kaffir prisoners were always lodged separately.
 ARRANGEMENTS IN GAOLS
 There are two wards in the prison for males; one for the whites and one for the Kaffirs—the gaol [also] accommodates other non- whites. Though they were free thus to lodge the Indians in the Kaffir ward, the gaoler had made provision for them in the ward for the whites.
 There are small cells, each with arrangements to accommodate ten or fifteen or even more prisoners. The prison is built entirely of stone. The cell has a good height. The walls are plastered and the floor is washed so that it always stays very clean. Moreover, the walls are frequently whitewashed, so that they always appear fresh. The area in front is paved with black stone, and is washed every day. It has a water-spout which enables three men to bathe simultaneously. There are two lavatories, and also benches. Above, there is a barbedwire covering intended to prevent prisoners from escaping by climbing the walls. Every room is well lighted and properly ventilated. The prisoners are locked in at six in the evening, and let out at six in the morning. The cell is locked from outside during the  night.  This means that, if anyone has a call of nature to answer, he cannot go out of the cell, and hence commodes, filled with water treated with a germicide, are placed in the cell itself.
 DIET
At the time of my imprisonment in Volksrust, the Indian
 prisoners were served mealie pap in the morning, and rice, with some vegetable, for the midday and evening meals. The vegetable served was mostly potato. No ghee was allowed at all. Under-trial prisoners were allowed, in addition, an ounce of sugar with mealie pap in the morning, and half a pound of bread for the midday meal. Some of the under-trial prisoners used to share a portion of their bread and sugar with the prisoners undergoing  sentences after conviction. Prisoners were entitled to meat twice [a week]; since, however, it was not given to either the Hindus or the Muslims, they were entitled to a substitute. We therefore made a joint petitionlibtech_467_footnoteand as a result it was ordered that we should receive an ounce of ghee and, on meat days, half a pound of beans in place of meat. Moreover, there was some tandalja growing by itself in the gaol garden, and we were allowed to pluck its leaves. We were also permitted from time to time to gather onions from the garden. There remained, therefore, nothing to complain of about food after ghee and beans had been sanctioned. The diet in the Johannesburg Gaol is somewhat different. There, only ghee is supplied with rice; no vegetables are allowed. In the evenings, there are green vegetables and mealie pap twice in the week, beans on three days, and potatoes, with mealie pap, once.
 Though this scale cannot be considered adequate, as judged by our habits, it is not bad in itself. Many Indians have a strong dislike of mealie pap and obstinately refuse to have it. But personally I think this is an error. Mealie pap is a sweet and strength-giving food. It can be taken in place of wheat in this country. It is very tasty when sugar is added to it, but even otherwise it tastes quite good when one is hungry. If one can get used to it, the foregoing scale will not prove inadequate nourishment; on the contrary, one may actually thrive on it. With some adjustments, it can be a perfect diet. But it is a matter of regret that we have grown so fond of good eating and have pampered ourselves into such habits that we are quick to lose our temper if we do not get the food we are used to. This was my experience in Volksrust, and it made me very unhappy. There was incessant grumbling about food, and very often there were such fretful scenes as if eating and living were the same thing, or as if we lived only to eat. Surely it does not become a satyagrahi to behave in this manner. It is our duty to try to get some changes made in the diet. If we fail, however, we must remain content with whatever is offered and thus demonstrate to the Government our determination not to yield; this also is our duty. There are some Indians who are afraid of going to gaol only because of the inconvenience in the matter of food. They
 
 must make a conscious effort to overcome the craving for good food that might have enslaved them.
 SENTENCED TO IMPRISONMENT
 As I mentioned above, all our cases were postponed for seven days, so that they came up for hearing on the 14th, when some of us were sentenced to a month and others to six weeks with hard labour. There was a boy eleven years old who was sentenced to 14 days’ simple imprison-ment. I was much worried lest the case against me should be withdrawn. The Magistrate retired for some time after the other cases had been disposed of, which made me all the more  nervous. The view generally expressed earlier was that I would be charged with failure to produce my register and refusal to give my thumb-impression, and also with inciting other Indians to enter the Transvaal without any right. While I was grappling with the problem in my mind, the Magistrate returned to the court and my case was called out. I was then sentenced to a fine of Rs. 25 or to two months’ hard labour. This made me very happy, and I congratulated myself on what I considered to be my good fortune in being allowed to join the others in gaol.
 CLOTHES
 After the sentence was passed, we were issued gaol uniforms. We were supplied each with a pair of short breeches, a shirt of coarse cloth, a jumper, a cap, a towel and a pair of socks and sandals. I think this is a very convenient dress for work. It is simple, and wears well. We should have nothing to complain about such a dress. We should not mind having it even for everyday wear. The dress given to the whites is somewhat different. They get a rimmed cap, stockings and handkerchief, in addition to two towels. Indians, too, need to be supplied with handkerchiefs.

 "
144,"January 5, 1909",INTERVIEW TO ‘‘THE NATAL MERCURY’’,"
  
 [DURBAN,
 January 5, 1909] Mr. Gandhi, the well-known leader of the Natal Indians, who has taken a prominent part in the agitation amongst the Indians in the Transvaal during the past
 year, is at present on a visit to Durban, and yesterday he was  interviewed  by  a
 representative of The Natal Mercury.
 Asked to give a sketch of the present position in the Transvaal, and more especially what has led up to the second stage—or ‘‘Passive Resistance Movement’’, as it is called—Mr. Gandhi said:
 I have read the editorial notes in the Mercury lately, saying that we have not been conducting this campaign with the same grace and dignity with which we started it, and I should like to say that, when I read that I felt rather grieved, because I have always understood that, whether the Mercury differed from the Indians in their struggle or agreed with them, we always received credit for fair fighting and good intentions. I may at once state that there has been no falling away from grace and dignity in our struggle. When we commenced that struggle, we did so deliberately, with a desire to use the cleanest weapons possible, and we have not departed from the principles then laid down.
 Asked to give a concise definition of these principles, Mr. Gandhi said:
 Well, we have eschewed resorting to violence in any shape or form, and we are simply trying to show the Government, by our personal sufferings, that we will not submit to a law which,  we  consider, wounds our consciences, and is otherwise objectionable. This  is called “passive resistance’’ for want of a better term. To put it plainly, it is really fighting evil by patience, not returning evil for evil. In this struggle, therefore, there can be no question of violence or intimidation. At the same time, I am free to confess  that  some members of the Indian community, in their over-zeal for the cause, have not hesitated to use threats against those who have deserted [and decided] to submit to the law, but whenever such acts have come to the notice of the leaders, they have been promptly dealt with, and every effort has been made to dissociate ourselves from any such acts. The charge has also been brought against us that we have invited the Natal Indians to take part in the struggle. This is not true. The Natal Indians who have gone to the Transvaal have rights of residence there, and they have gone there because they felt that they could not reap the results of our sufferings without, a original residents of the Transvaal, taking their share in them. They had a right of access there, for under the new law any Indian who has lived in the Transvaal for a period of three years previous to the war is entitled to return. I notice it has also been suggested that we are trying, during this second stage of the struggle, to gain an advantage to which we were not entitled when we took up passive resistance, or at the time when the compromise of last January was effected. This, too, is wrong. The position at the time to the compromise was perfectly clear. The Indians were fighting for the
 
 repeal of the Asiatic Act of 1907. This does not mean that we objected to the complete identification of every Asiatic who was entitled to remain in the country. What we objected to was the spirit of the Act of 1907, and some of the objectionable sections of that Act. It was the methods that we really objected to. For instance, with regard to the finger-prints question—for which I actually suffered physically—I never, at any stage of the struggle, said that the giving of finger-prints was objectionable as such. It was owing to the utter disregard of every representation made by the Indians, and of every sentiment which they cherished, that the struggle was really undertaken.
 Proceeding, Mr. Gandhi dealt with the compromise entered into and said:
 Whilst it is true, with regard to that compromise, that there was nothing written in so many words as to the repeal of the Asiatic Act of 1907, reading between the lines one can read even the repeal of the Act in the written terms of the compromise, but as I have said often, and repeat now, General Smuts deliberately, but verbally, promised to repeal the Act, if the British Indians fulfilled their part of the compromise, that is to say, underwent voluntary registration. As the whole of South Africa knows, we have done so. I might also point out that General Smuts repeated his promise in his speechlibtech_468_footnotelibtech_469_footnoteat Richmond three days after the compromise, and that speech, although it has been brought to his notice, he has never contradicted or qualified. If this Act had been repealed, there would certainly have been no agitation whatsoever, and there would have been no question either of the status of educated Indians, because, as has been shown by the latest decision of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal, an educated Indian is not a prohibited immigrant under the Immigration Act of the Transvaal, and his right to enter under that Act is affected and taken away only by means of the Asiatic Act of 1907. Therefore, the repeal of the Asiatic Act of 1907 would have meant the re-instatement of the educated Asiatics.
 THE INTERVIEWER: You mean, of course, the new-comers?
 MR. GANDHI: Yes; and let it be remembered that these educated Indians were not affected, either before the war or after the war, under the Peace Preservation Ordinance, so that the question of the educated Asiatic is in no sense of the term a new question. It is now mentioned prominently and separately, because of the controversy that has arisen over the repeal of the Act, and over the offer made by General Smuts to repeal that Act, and the fulfilment of certain other conditions which were not contemplated at the time of the January compromise, one of
 
 which was that we should forego the rights of educated Asiatics and allow them to be considered as prohibited immigrants under the Immigration Act of the Transvaal. I claim that no  self-respecting Indian could accept a bargain of that nature. At the present moment the controversy has assumed, so far as the merits of the case are concerned, a purely academic shape. Everybody admits that the Act of 1907 is useless, if not actually harmful, even from the Colonial standpoint. The Supreme Court, in its two decisions given recently, has said as much. It is not required for the identification or registration of Indians. The new Act of last year brings about that satisfactorily. With reference to these educated Indians, it is admitted that we are entitled to a few highly educated Indians being allowed to enter the Transvaal for our wants, if we are to remain there as a progressive community. The only difficulty with reference to the educated Indians is that, whereas General Smuts states that they can only enter on sufferance on temporary permits, we maintain that they should be able to enter as a matter of right, provided that they pass an education rest, which may be imposed by the immigration officer, and we have further added that the test may be so severe as to allow of only six such men being able to enter the Transvaal during any one year. That this could be easily done is shown by the practice in Natal and the Cape, and even in Australia, which has not allowed, so far as I know, a single Asiatic to enter that Colony by means of the education test.
 Continuing, Mr. Gandhi said:
 The passive resisters are now told that whilst these two very reasonable demands might have been granted before  passive resistance was taken up, they could not now be granted, because of the influence that any yielding to passive resistance might create on the native mind. Personally, I consider that that fear is totally groundless. In the first place, if our demands are just, they ought to be granted, whether we are passive resisters or not; and, in the second place, if the natives were to adopt our methods, and replace physical violence by passive resistance, it would be a positive gain to South Africa. Passive resisters, when they are in the wrong, do mischief only to themselves, When they are in the right, they succeed in spite of any odds. It is not difficult to see in Natal, that, if Bambata, instead of murdering Inspector Hunt, had simply taken up passive resistance, because he felt that the imposition of the poll-tax was unjustifiable, much bloodshed would have been avoided, and a great deal of money would have been saved; and, at the same time, if the natives as a body did not feel the imposition of the poll-tax, Bambata’s passive resistance would have been in vain. If, on the other hand, the natives did, in any large body, resent the imposition of the tax, no amount of physical violence by
 
 the Government could possibly have been enough to collect such a tax from people who simply sat still and would not pay it. So that the South African Colonists should, in my opinion, rather welcome passive resistance in place of physical violence; and, after all, is it not merely the supersession of the Mosaic law of a tooth for a tooth by Christian law of non-resistance of evil by evil?
 THE INTERVIEWER: To narrow down the point, I take it that you are insisting upon the promise, if it was made, or whether it was made or not—you are insisting upon the repeal of the Asiatic Act of 1907, because you only want to establish the absolute right of the educated Indian to go into the Transvaal. Is that so?
 MR. GANDHI: If he can pass the test, certainly.
 THE INTERVIEWER: But the Imperial Government has taken up the attitude that a self-governing Colony can exclude whom it will; at least, broadly, that is the position which has been taken up. On the other hand, you claim a right which the Imperial Government says the self-governing Colony is entitled to exercise, and say that it cannot exclude a certain class.
 MR. GANDHI: I don’t think that the Imperial Government has at any stage taken up the attitude that self-governing Colonies have a perfect right to exclude whom they will; but, if that has been stated, then it is a departure from the Colonial policy hitherto followed. I don’t think the Imperial Government would pass any such law. The Imperial Government made a mistake with reference to the Immigration Law of the Transvaal—that is to say, in no section was there any mention of Asiatics, except in the most indirect manner; but the Govern-ment of the Transvaal has placed an interpretation upon one section which brings about that result, and the Imperial Government, having accepted that, now finds it most difficult to intervene effectively. If the Imperial Government is now going to say that the self-governing Colonies have a perfect right to exclude whom they will, then that is an innovation in Colonial policy hitherto followed. You know that, in 1897, the late Mr. Escombe actually submitted to Mr. Chamberlain a draft law to exclude Asiatics from this Colony, and Mr. Chamberlain then said that he would not pass it, and suggested that any exclusion law should not be racial, but should be of a general character. That suggestion was adopted, and since then the Natal Act has been copied everywhere throughout the Colonies. But, with regard to what members of the Imperial Ministry have said as to the rights of the Colonies to exclusion of whom they will, I don’t think you will find any definite pronouncement.
 Asked what was the position to-day in the Transvaal, Mr. Gandhi said:
 The position to-day is that the Indians have gone through the struggle for the last two years, and over 2‚000 have gone through the prisons of the Transvaal—that is to say, nearly one-third of the actual resident Indian population of the Transvaal, and one-sixth of the possible Indian population of the Transvaal. This has also carried conviction amongst some representative Europeans, and, as a result, a small Committee has been formed, with Mr. W. Hosken as Chairman, which Committee has pledged itself to support the British Indians in their struggle, even to the extent of facing imprisonment, if need be, until the claims put forward by the Indians, which these  friends consider to be just, are granted. The Government considers that it will be able to starve us into submission. It is perfectly true that some may become exhausted and yield, but I believe that we have amongst ourselves a very large and sufficient number to carry on the struggle, in the face of all odds. There are some who have al-ready sold out their businesses, given up everything, and are merely carry-ing on the struggle because they consider that a great principle is involv-ed, and if my estimate is true, I can only say that the conclusion can be but one, viz., that our demands will be granted. How early or how late that will come about will depend upon our own strength. Then, in Eng- land we have the South Africa British Indian Committee, with Lord Ampthill—sometime acting Viceroy of India—as chairman, also working for the same object, and that Committee has on it many influential An-glo-Indians of wide experience, and I think that, if we are patient enough we will be able to gain sympathy from all quarters. Meanwhile, the Transvaal Government has again begun to take active steps. I have a telegram saying that nearly 30 Indians have already been deported to Natal, and they have immediately re-entered the Transvaal, and now await trial there. This time, I understand, they will be charged under a different section, and will, therefore, suffer imprisonment. The Natal leaders and 33 others will be brought before the Magistrate, probably to-morrow. They will share the same fate, so that the process of filling the gaols of the Transvaal has now commenced, and it remains to be seen whether they are equal to the task or not. The Government evidently thinks that by these drastic measures, and by the magistrates imposing the fullest  penalties provided by the law, the Indians will succumb and submit to it, but I do not think so.
 THE INTERVIEWER: Has the law-abiding Indian, rightly in the Transvaal, any substantial grievance against the laws there as they stand today?
 MR. GANDHI: Certainly. Although we are not now fighting on the ground of any such grievances, there are grievances, For instance, the most law-abiding Indian is deprived of the ownership of land, and can not possess a piece of land in the country, except in special Locations. That may be said to be a most tangible grievance. But that is apart from what we are fighting for. The principle involved in this struggle is, or was, at one time, religious, that is to say, the law of 1907 strikes at the religious sentiment of the people, but the principal object now is on account of the honour of the Indian race, for we are to be treated as an integral part of the Empire, or we are not.
 THE INTERVIEWER: That is a very wide principle, but, as I understand it, the real crux of the whole thing is this question of the right of educated Indians to enter the Transvaal. In that case there is the statement already referred to as to the Imperial Government not being prepared to quarrel with a. self-governing Colony which denies that right of entry.
 MR. GANDHI: Then, in that case, we fight both the local Government and the Imperial Government. But I still believe that the Imperial Government is with us.
 THE INTERVIEWER: Well, it is a certain impasse just now. You are simply fighting to make the position so unbearable that some Imperial action will be taken.
 MR. GANDHI: Well, I have so great a faith in the spirit of the struggle, that I feel that, before the Imperial Government, intervenes, all the Colonies in South Africa will say “No, we must grant those just demands.” There are already signs of that in the Transvaal, and some prominent Europeans who had at first deprecated our entering on the second struggle are now strongly supporting us.

 "
145,,SHOPKEEPERS VERSUS HAWKERS,"
  
 STOMACH VERSUS LIMBS
 Once upon a time a great quarrel arose between the stomach and the limbs of the body. The hands said, “We shall do no work. We are tired of working. We carry food to the mouth every time, but it is the stomach that eats it and wastes it. We get no help from the stomach.” The legs said, “We shall not walk a step. We have fruitlessly slaved for the stomach. It is only the stomach that really enjoys itself. The stomach is honoured like the king. It has fallen to us to do the drudgery.” The other limbs of the body also made similar
 complaints. The stomach did a good deal of explaining, saying, “The work I put in is not visible. The hands merely carry the food to the mouth, and their work is then over. The legs enjoy rest after fetching the food. But I have to work twenty-four hours a day, though you may not be able to see it. If I take rest even for a minute, all of you stop working. You yourselves will be the first to suffer if you stop working. So far as I am concerned, I can carry on my work for some time, though, without you, I too shall have to die ultimately. But if you stop working, know for certain that you are virtually dead before I die.” However, the limbs were not convinced. They stopped working. In twenty-four hours, the hands, the feet and the other limbs of the body became weak. They repented. As the stomach did not receive any food, they became worried. In the end, they were convinced of the truth of what the stomach had said. They realized that the work done by the stomach was not inconsiderable, and that because the stomach worked for many limbs, [the benefit of] its work was spread all over, with the result that it could not be noticed by any particular limb. But when the limbs stopped working, they discovered that it was they who were the first victims.
 We were reminded of this story by some letters which we have received. The correspondents accuse businessmen in a number of ways. Some have gone to the length of abusing them, while others hold out threats against them. Many of them put forward religion as the excuse, quite late in the day, for not going to gaol. As the limbs in the story became jealous of the stomach, all these persons have become envious of the shopkeepers. They charge the Transvaal shopkeepers with having betrayed the hawkers and ruined them. The businessmen are enjoying themselves [they say], having sent the hawkers to gaol. One of the correspondents, while he refers to hawkers in respectful terms on the one hand, states on the other that they cannot voice their views, freely at meetings because they are afraid of the shopkeepers. We have not published these letters, for they are not such as will enhance the prestige of the community. The reason for these charges is the fact that some traders have transferred their businesses to the names of their wives or of some whites. It behoves these traders to be generous, like the stomach, and reason with the hawkers gently. The community has submitted to slavery for a very long time and has never tasted independence. Now that we have reached the threshold of independence with the help of the weapon of satyagraha, and are being freed from slavery, everyone, great or small,
 
 finds it difficult to adjust himself naturally to the new situation. We envy those whom we find to be superior to the rest. There is nothing surprising about this. Every nation which has attained freedom has passed through such a stage of heart-burning. Before a child is delivered, the mother suffers pangs which are like agonies of death. It is then that the child is born. In the same way, before we see the birth of freedom, not only shall we have to suffer the pangs inflicted by the Government, but also those of our own making. The charges against the traders mentioned above are ill-conceived. Those of them who have transferred their businesses to whites did so neither out of greed nor out of fear of going to gaol. Most of them are in fact ready to go to gaol. The only object of transferring businesses was to see that we did not ourselves place in the hands of the Government the ammunition that it might use against us. We must remind the hawkers that when hands were laid on Indians in January [1908], it was mainly the businessmen who were first attacked. Almost all the traders of Standerton have been to gaol. The Chairman of the Association, Mr. Cachalia, has been to gaol. Mr. Aswat and Mr. Nagadi, who had got themselves arrested with great difficulty, have completed their term of imprisonment and likewise Mr. Ebrahim Kazi is in gaol now; and he too got the opportunity only when he transferred his business to a white. Mr. Bhabha went to gaol in Middelburg, and Mr. Belim in Christiana. At present Mr. Mahomed Mia is in gaol. Thus, a large number of traders have suffered imprisonment. Those who came specially from Natal to help us are also leading merchants of the Colony. It is therefore not proper to accuse the traders. The hawkers ought to see that they do not envy the traders. They should  be  satisfied if the traders go to gaol. To say that the traders have ruined them suggests that they think they themselves made a mistake  in  going to gaol. In fact, we should believe that those who  are responsible for sending us to gaol have done us good. Those who have gone to gaol have been the gainers. Those who have not gone to gaol have been the losers. Those who have sacrificed their wealth for the sake of their motherland have in reality earned it. Those who betrayed their country, their prestige and their pledge, and clung to their money are, really speaking, poor in spite of their riches, We hope therefore that those who have written letters to us and those who hold similar views will ponder over our words and will persist in the fight rather than, by abandoning it, lose the game that we are about to win.
If it behoves the hawkers to realize this, the traders too cannot be
 let off. We cannot say that they are entirely blameless. No doubt there are some among them who are cowards, to whom their money is their God. Their heart is not in the movement. Some make big speeches and nothing more. All the traders should follow the example of the stomach. It gives more to the limbs than it keeps for itself of what it digests. Whereas the limbs work only for some time, the stomach slaves all the twenty-four hours, not for its own sake but for the sake of the limbs. In the same way, it is up to the traders to safeguard the interests of hawkers and their dependants. Though they are big men, they must learn to be humble and, though masters, they must act as servants. One may transfer one’s business to another’s name if it cannot be helped. But this is only the last resort, fit enough for half- cowards. We hope that those who are resolved to be lions, who are brave satyagrahis, will never take out licences in the names of third parties, but help the cause of the community by winding up their businesses and embracing poverty for the present. That is the only right way for a man who claims the privilege of social  status,  of wealth. We cannot say that the hawkers have had no reason to complain; no one would have any ground for complaint if every businessman did his duty and sacrificed self-interest for the common good. The Indians in South Africa have their eyes fixed at present on the Transvaal merchants. The hawkers have to fight their battle independently, but in case they give in, the traders will also share part of the blame for that. Day by day, the situation in the Transvaal is getting more delicate. We pray to God to show the right path to the traders, the hawkers and all other Indians, to keep them resolute, to give them the courage to bear all the hardships that their heroic undertaking may entail.

146,,OTHER LEADERS OF NATAL,"
  
 Every Indian will want to know what the leaders of Natal have been doing, apart from those who have sacrificed their all for the sake of the country and proceeded to the Transvaal. The question that our Johannes-burg correspondent has posed for Natal is worth pondering over. Every Indian in South Africa is morally bound to help the Transvaal struggle. Natal’s obligation is twofold. But we regret to say that the leaders who have remained behind are not doing their full
 duty. This ought to make all of us hang our heads in shame. The first duty of the leaders is to start raising contributions to the Congress fund. The Congress is running short of money. It is in debt. Mr. Robinson’s Bill is hanging over us. When the brave heroes of Natal go to gaol, it will be the duty of the Congress to dispatch telegrams; what does it propose to do in that case? Where will it get the money from? Will not the Congress offer any help if it is found that the families of those imprisoned in the Transvaal are facing starvation? If it wants to help, what source will it draw upon?
 Movements for raising contributions were initiated again and again. They never made any progress. This is not they way to conduct the affairs of a big public body.
 The futile dispute with the Main Line [Indians] is dragging on merrily. On behalf of the Main Line leaders, Mr. Mahomed Ibrahim and Mr. Kharsani had a meeting with Mr. Dawad Mahomed in the Volksrust gaol. A settlement was almost reached, but it appears everything is in the melting-pot again. It is obviously the duty of the leaders of the Main Line Indians to offer monetary help rather than raise issues. If only they will see the point, the position is simple: their demand can be easily met, nay, it is almost as good as met. They want that a large number of Main Line Indians should be included in the Committee as of right. This right has always been there. All the same, they can demand an assurance that the right will be duly respected. The other point in dispute is that their consent should be necessary for every item of expenditure exceeding £25. Though this is a trivial matter, the Congress can pass a resolution to that effect. The Main Line Indians should realize that it is for themselves, not for others, to ensure that they enjoy these rights. The Congress certainly cannot stand in their way. But it is not in the least proper to hold up the work of collection just for this reason. We hope that the Main Line Indians will not fail in their duty.

147,,HINDU-MUSLIM RIOTS,"
  
 Reuter cables received here report violent Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta. It is believed that several persons were killed. Some Hindus attacked a mosque, which provoked the Muslims. They retaliated. The
 Army was called in. It appears from the cables that order has not yet been restored. None of us can judge how far these reports are true. It is, however, apparent that the cause of the riots was a white officer. There appears to be no reason why Hindus and Muslims should fight among themselves. In their short-sightedness, the officers imagine that they stand to gain if the two communities fall out with each other. The situation in India is so critical at present that the Government, as also the officer—a large number of them—believe, can rest secure if the two communities fight with each other. One must consider what the duty of overseas Indians in this situation is. It is clear to us that, whether we are Hindus or Muslims, we must not support either side. We should feel sorry that a third party has provoked quarrels among us and pray to Khuda-Ishwar in mosques and in temples to grant that there might be an end to the disputes that frequently arise between our two communities. We are convinced that every patriotic Indian will see that this is the only way to ensure the progress of India.
 The war of satyagraha that we have been waging can be effective in every situation, and we may rest confident that, in case disputes arise between the two communities, we can meet them with this same weapon.

148,,VANCOUVER INDIANS,"
  
 It appears the Indians of Vancouver, in Canada, are standing up to the Government with great courage. They refused to walk into the trap laid by the Government there for removing them to a malarial region. They will now remain in Vancouver, instead of migrating to the British Honduras. Two of their representatives who had gone on an inspection tour of the Honduras reported that it was not suitable for Indian settlement. They allege that inducements were held out to them to submit a false report. But they were not influenced. They only thought of the interest of their compatriots. Both these Indians deserve congratulations.
 Vancouver Indians are not men who can be trifled with. Another Instance of this kind has come to our knowledge. From reports in newspapers published there, we find that a professor named Teja Sing, who has settled there and passed the M.A. examination, addressing a
 
 meeting of thousands of Sikhs and other Indians, spoke as follows:
 As far as the present agitation in India is concerned, the country will put up a constitutional fight. But should redress be denied, an Indian will arise who, equipped with arms, will lead the people to fight with bombs and explosives.
 The uncontrolled powers which the white officers in India enjoy have made some of them totally incapable of understa- nding the people. The eyes of the Sikhs are being opened. They are beginning to understand things. India wants justice. Mr. Cunningham wrote some years ago in a book of history that if England failed to do justice, there would arise in India a great military leader who would seize all power in his hands. No State can be built on the foundation of bad faith.

149,,PHOENIX SCHOOL,"
  
 We hinted last week that we might write [more] about this school.libtech_470_footnotelibtech_471_footnoteWe are now in a position to report as under:
 BOARDING
 Those in Phoenix who live with their families can take in up to eight boarders. It is intended that the boys who may be accepted as boarders will be treated as one’s own children. This practice prevailed in India in olden days, and it should be revived as far as possible. There is only one condition for a boy’s admission, namely, he should be in sound health. Indians of any caste or community will be admitted. No distinctions will be made in such matters as food, etc. The boys will get the same food as the inmates, with certain modifications. It will be, in effect, as under:
 Half a bottle of milk, two ounces of ghee, flour, mealie meal, pulse, rice, fresh fruit, green vegetables, sugar bread, nuts (mainly groundnut).
 The diet will be provided regularly, spread over not less than three and not more than four meals as it may suit the boys. Which of these items should be included in which meal will be decided in the
 
 light of our customary practice or in any other way that may be found to be best from experience.
 The diet does not include tea, coffee or cocoa. It is our view, based on our knowledge and experience, that things such as tea are harmful even to adults, and much more so to children. Some medical men think that the introduction of tea, etc., has led to an increase in the incidence of ill-health.
 Moreover, tea, coffee and cocoa are produced through the  labour of men who work more or less in conditions of slavery. In Natal, for instance, it is the indentured labourers who work on tea and coffee plantations. Cocoa is produced in the Congo, where indentured Kaffirs are made to work beyond all limits of endurance. We think that slave labour is used even in the production of sugar. Though it is not possible to look too deeply into these matters, we are firmly of the view that these three things should be used as sparingly as possible.
 Furthermore, if we claim to be fired with the spirit of swadeshi in Indian, we had better avoid these three things as far as possible. There is no need to go into these arguments, especially those against tea, in this place. Suffice it to say that boys do not need these things.
 BOARDING CHARGES
 
 We find that boarding charges come to not less than a guinea a month. The figure includes the barber’s  service charges. The provisions themselves amount to £1 [per head]. A shilling is added to this by way of washing charges. No separate charges for a barber’s services are included since this work is mostly done by the inmates of Phoenix themselves and does not entail any expenditure.
 LODGING
 It will not be possible to provide lodging arrangements similar to the boarding tariff outlined above. There are not enough buildings to provide the requisite accommodation, nor can the boys be conveniently lodged with families. It will therefore be necessary to build a dormitory for them. We do not see any possibility of our being able to provide lodging for them before such a dormitory is built. To show that there will be no differential treatment as between the boys who may be admitted and the boys of the families which will provide board to them, it is intended that the two classes of boys will sleep in the same room. It is thus necessary to put up a building which
 
 will provide sleeping accommodation to about 20 boys. The construction of such a building and of a reservoir to provide bathing facilities for the boys is estimated to cost £200. These arrangements for boys can materialize if those who want to have their boys admitted agree to raise this sum. The estimates have been prepared in consultation with the architect, Mr. Kallenbach, and an Indian carpenter. The ownership of the building will be vested in those who donate the money, provided they will have no rights so long as the school functions. If it ceases to functions, the donors may, if they choose, carry away the building. The necessary amount may either be provided by the parents who want to send their boys, or may be raised through donations from others. Those who donate money will be serving a public cause. The inmates of Phoenix are so busy these days that they are in no position to undertake the necessary effort to raise a fund.
 DRESS
It is more convenient to prescribe a uniform dress for the boys.
The following will be the requirements of dress according to us:
              1     Hair-brush   £   s. 1   d. 6      3   Half-length 						breeches        6    0      3   Shirts        6    0      4   Shorts        4    0      2   Pairs 						of sandals or shoes        6    0      1   Hat        2    0      2   Night 						dresses        4    0      2   Towels        2    0      2   Napkins        1    0      4   Pocket 						handkerchiefs        1    0      
1 13 6
 The cap will be of the model customary in one’s community. The hat mentioned above is merely for use when working in the sun. Whether such a dress should be provided for the boys or not will depend on their parents. If any parents do not want to incur this expenditure or are not anxious to teach the boys such simplicity, they may send with the boys materials for the items indicated above in a small bag or packet. If they ask us, we suggest that they send nothing
 with the boys, but give us a sum of £1.13.6, with permission to have the required garments made and given them to the boys to wear. The requirements of dress indicated above are for one year.
 BEDS
 We do not intend to provide Indian-style beds to sleep on, but think of using planks of the kind in use in gaols. They appear to be more conducive to one’s well-being. We think it is healthier for the boys to be made to sleep on blankets than to be allowed cotton mattresses. But we shall make necessary alterations in this regard as desired by parents. According to us, the boys will need the following things:
          3   Blankets   10 						s     1   Pillow    1 						s     4   Bedsheets    4 						s     2   Pillow-covers    1 						s             16 						s      
 Parents may themselves send these materials; otherwise we shall be prepared to buy them. Leaving the expenditure on dress and blankets, etc., to the decision of the parents, we calculate that the other expenditure to be borne by them will amount to one guinea per month. It is proposed to charge admission fee at the rate of £1 for each boy. The sum is intended to be spent on buying the required books for him. It is not that books worth that amount will be necessarily bought. But the intention is to keep some provision for the miscellaneous expenditure on the boys that the school may find it necessary to incur. Books required for advanced boys will have to be provided by the parents.
 TEACHERS
 It will be observed from the account given above that we do not propose to charge any monthly fee. We are in a position to follow this course only because the teachers maintain themselves  by  their earnings from the [International Printing] Press. With the permission of the press, every teacher gives his services at certain hours. It is also planned to have a School Board which will consider methods of teaching, etc.
Among the teachers will be Purshottamdas Desai (Principal), Mr.
West, Mr. Cordes, Miss West and others.
 CURRICULUM
 The main object of this school is to strengthen the pupils’ character. It is said that real education consists in teaching the pupil the art of learning. In other words, a desire for knowledge should grow in him. knowledge, however, is of many kinds. There is some knowledge which is harmful. If, therefore, the boys’ character is not formed well, they will acquire the wrong kind of knowledge. Because of lack of proper planning in education, we observe that some persons grow to be atheists and some, though highly educated, fall a prey to vices. It is therefore the main object of this school to assist in building the moral character of boys. We can see this aim realized in Mr. Hassan Mia and Mr. Ravikrishna. We can form some idea of what Mr. Hassan Mia has been doing in England. Mr. Ravikrishna is in gaol today for the sake of the country. Both these have gone out from the school at Phoenix.
 Boys will be taught their own language, that is, Gujarati or Hindi and, if possible, Tamil, as also English, arithmetic, history, geography, botany and zoology. Advanced pupils will also be taught algebra and geometry. It is expected that they can be brought up to the matriculation level.
 For purposes of religious instruction, parents will be allowed to send any religious teacher of their choice. Hindu boys will be taught the fundamentals of the Hindu religion in any manner that may be desired by their parents. Indian Christians will be taught the elements of the Christian religion by Mr. West and Mr. Cordes and the basis of the teachings of Theosophy. For boys of the Muslim faith, we want to arrange for a Moulvi, if possible. They will be permitted to go to Durban on Fridays. We believe that the education of any people is fruitless without religious instruction. Therefore, it is they duty of parents with a religious bent of mind to provide their children with both religious and secular education. We shall find on reflection that what we call secular education is also for strengthening the religious instinct. We think education imparted without any such aim is often harmful.
 Boys will be taught the history of ancient and modern India so as to inculcate in them love of India and help them grow patriotic.
 Apart from this, there is no other information to be given. We hope that those who want to send their boys will do so indeed. As for the difficulty about the building, it is the duty of the parents to
 remove it. It is hardly necessary to mention that a report on the school and a statement of accounts will be published regularly.

 "
150,,HIGHER-GRADE SCHOOL,"
  
 It is plainly the intention of the Government gradually to drive away Indian boys from higher-grade Indian schools and other Government schools. We have already shown that the remedy lies in having a school of our own, and have been saying this in connection with the Phoenix schoollibtech_472_footnote. All the same, it is necessary to  fight  the Government. There are two ways of fighting it and securing justice. One, through courts of law, and two, through petitions, etc. Whether we can obtain redress through the courts of law cannot be stated without careful study. We can come to no final conclusion from the fact that a suit was filed once and dismissed by the Supreme Court. Hence, a good lawyer may be consulted and, if advised by him, the matter should be fought out legally. If that is not possible, a petition may be made. The matter should be taken right up to the Imperial Government. Of course, we shall need to have sanctions behind all these moves. We can apply them through satyagraha. We need not at the moment go into the question of how this can be done. We can discuss it later. Meanwhile, it is necessary that the leaders take the steps outlined above as expeditiously as possible.

151,,MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [– II],"
  
 
 WORK
 The Government can exact nine hours’ labour daily from those sentenced to rigorous imprisonment. The prisoners are  locked  in every day at six o’clock. At half-past five in the morning, there is a bell to wake them up, and the cell-doors open at six. The prisoners are counted when they are locked in and again when the are let out. In order that the counting may be orderly and speedy, every prisoner is
 
 required to stand at attention near his bed. Each one must roll up his bedding, put it in its proper place and, after a wash, be ready before six. Then, at seven, work starts. The work assigned is of various kinds. On the first day, we had to dig up the soil in a field near the main road for purposes of cultivation.libtech_473_footnotelibtech_474_footnoteAbout 30 Indians were there. No one was thus compelled to work if he was not fit enough. We were taken there along with the Kaffirs. The soil was very hard, and since it had to be dug up with spades, the labour involved was strenuous. The day was very hot. The place of work must have been at a distance of about one and a half miles from the gaol. All the Indians set to work with great energy. But only a few of them were used to hard work, so that we were all quite. exhausted with the exertion. Among us was Ravikrishna, son of Babu Talevantsingh. I was much disconcerted to see him work, and yet the energy with which he went about it gladdened my heart. As the day advanced, we found the task quite hard. The warder was rather sharp of temper. He shouted at the prisoners all the time to keep on working. The more he shouted, the more nervous the Indians became. I even saw some of them in tears. One, I noticed, had a swollen foot. I was sorely distressed at this. However, I went on urging everyone to ignore the warder and carry on as best he could. I too got exhausted. There were large blisters on the palms, the lymph oozing out of them. It was difficult to bend down, and the spade seemed to weight a maund. For myself, I was praying to God all the time to save my honour, so that I might not break down, and to give me strength to keep doing the work as well as  I should. Placing my trust in Him, I went on with the work. The warder started rebuking me. He did so because I was resting. I told him that there was no need to shout at me, that I would do my best and work to the utmost limit of endurance. Just then, I observed Mr. Jhinabhai Desai fainting away. I paused a little, not being allowed to leave the place of work. The warder went to the spot. I found that I, too, must go, and I ran. Two other Indians also followed me. Water was sprinkled over Jhinabhai. He came to. The warder sent away the others to their work. I was allowed to remain by his side. After plenty of cold water had been poured over Jhinabhai’s head, he  felt  somewhat better. I told the warder that Jhinabhai would not be able to walk down to the gaol. Hence a cab was sent for. I was ordered to take him in it to the gaol. As I splashed cold water over Jhinabhai’s head, I thought to myself, “A great many Indians have been going to gaol at my word. What a sinner I would be if I had been giving wrong advice
! Am I the cause of all this suffering on the part of Indians?” As I
 
 thought thus, I sighed deeply. I considered the matter afresh, with God as witness, and, after being plunged in reflection for some time, I collected myself with a smile. I felt I had given the right advice. If to bear suffering is in itself a kind of happiness, there is no need to be worried by it. This was only a case of fainting but even if it were to be death, I could have given no other advice Seeing that our sole duty was to break free from our fetters by enduring every hardship rather than remaining bound for life, I felt light in heart and tried to instil courage in Jhinabhai.
 As soon as the cab arrived, Jhinabhai was made to lie down in it and was taken away. A complaint was made to the chief warder. After inquiry, the warder was reprimanded. Jhinabhai was not taken out for work at noon. Similarly, four other Indians were found too weak [to work]. All the others resumed work. One is required to work from twelve noon to one. At noon, supervision over us was assigned to a Kaffir warder instead of a white one. He proved a little better. He did not go on prodding us. Occasionally, he would shout a few words. Moreover, at noon Kaffirs and Indians were deployed in the same place, though at different spots. We were given softer soil to dig up.
 I had a talk with the contractor. He said that the labour of Indian prisoners was likely to put him to some loss. He admitted that Indians could not all at once equal the Kaffirs in point of physical strength. I also told him that they were not likely to work [harder] for fear of the warder, that they would do as much—and only as much—as they possibly could for fear of God. But I found it necessary later to revise this idea altogether. Let us see how that happened.
 We were taken out [again] the next day. But we were sent with a Kaffir warder instead of a white one. The Kaffir, moreover, was not the same one as on the previous day. He had been advised not to bother us at all about work.

152,"January 	9, 1909","LETTER TO “RAND DAILY MAIL”
libtech_475_footnote","
        PHOENIX, 
   THE 	EDITOR  RAND 	DAILY 	MAIL 	[JOHANNESBURG] SIR, January 	9, 1909 
  	I notice that there still exists some doubt as to what is wanted by 	my countrymen in the Transvaal, who have now been fighting against 	tremendous odds for the past two years. I will, therefore, with your 	per-mission, endeavour to state the Indian submission as briefly as 	possible. What 	we want is the following:  Repeal 		of Act 		2 to 1907;  Legal 		recognition of 		the right 		of highly 		educated Indians to 		enter the 		Transvaal like 		any other 		immigrant, under 		the education 		test provided 		by the 		Immigration Act 		of the 		Colony with 		such administrative 		severity in applying 		the education 		test as 		to exclude all but 		six highly 		educated Indians in 		one year.  Repeal 	of the old Act is necessary,   for 		the honour of 		the country, 		because it is claimed 		that General 		Smuts is under 		promise to repeal 		the Act.  Act 		2 to 1907 is 		in conflict with the 		new Act of 1908, and, a 		recent decision of 		the Supreme 		Court has 		shown, the running 		together of the two 		dissimilar Acts having 		the same 		purpose may lead 		to dangerous results.  Recent 		events have shown that 		Act 2 to 		1907 is 		not meant, 		[as] was stated 		by General 		Smuts at 		one time, to 		be a dead 		letter.  The 		Act, being still 		on the 		Statute-book of the 		Colony, constitutes an 		offence to 		the Turkish 		Mahomedans, and,     
 therefore, continues to offend the religious susceptibilities of Indian Mahomedans.
  It 	is open to 	the Government, 	if they 	wish to harass 	British Indians, 	to enforce 	the most objectionable 	clauses of 	the Act. 
 As to the educated British Indians, General Smuts [stated that there will be no] objection raised [to the entry] of such persons, if they apply under the Asiatic Registration Act. This is highly unsatisfactory, because
  the 	powers granted by the 	Asiatic Act refer only 	to temporary permits;  such 	temporary permits, even 	though they may be 	of long duration, 	would still make 	the holders 	prohibited immigrants;  the 	permits, therefore, 	would prevent 	the holders 	[from] carrying 	on their profession;  temporary 	permits would leave 	their holders at the 	mercy of 	the Government. 
 What Indians want, in place of such makeshifts, is the retention of the undoubted right of highly educated Indians to enter the Transvaal as free immigrants, provided that they pass any education test that the authorities may impose.
 If it be objected that there is no such power reserved in law as to enable the Minister to impose severe or discriminating tests—I deny that the present law is not enough for the purpose—my countrymen will offer no objection to administrative discrimination against them. Thus, power can be given to the Minister to set any education test, even different tests for different classes, the Minister’s decision in such cases being final and not appealable to the Supreme  Court. Under such a severe test, it will be competent for the Government to limit the entry of highly educated Indians to only six in any one year.
 My countrymen resent a racial bar as regards educated Indians, it being deemed a national dishonour. Whilst, therefore, the matter with General Smuts is largely sentimental, with Indians it is one of vital principle.
 Repeal of Act 2 of 1907 is necessary, whether we demand it or not. Amendment of the Immigration Act is necessary, because of the severe condemnation by the Supreme Court of its several clauses. Why not, then, at the time of amending it, free it from the taint of the
 
 Asiatic Act, and alter it so as to give the Minister additional powers regarding the imposition of the education test? Indians on their part will undertake not to raise passive resistance over the administration of the education test, so long as six highly educated Indians are passed under the test during any single year.

153,,EDUCATION OF INDIANS IN NATAL,"
  
 We wrote last week about the decision of the Government not to admit boys above the age of 14 to the higher-grade Indian schools.libtech_476_footnoteWhatever steps it is proposed to take in this connection must be taken immediately. On further inquiry, we find that there are two ways of filing a suit. First, a suit may be fild against the refusal to admit an over-age boy, and second, for securing admission of Indian children into an English school. The second approach may perhaps succeed. There is less possibility of success in the first. Even then, it is worthwhile to file a case of that kind. It will expose the Government’s intentions. In filing a case of the second kind, we need not think of sending our boys to an English school afterwards; only, if we win the case, boys may get more concessions in the higher-grade [school].
 Both these suits will cost money. If Indian parents raise it something can be done.

154,,IMMIGRATION COMMISSION,"
  
 The Natal Immigration Commission commenced its sessions in Durban on Tuesday. Anyone who wants may give evidence before it. It is the duty of the Congress to give evidence on this issue. Indivi- duals may also do so. According to us, there is only one thing which all Indians can say, and that is to ask for an end to the system of indenture. There is hardly any difference between indenture and slavery. We assume that Indians who have come over under the system
 
 have stood to gain somewhat. But, in fact, by accepting slavery for the sake of pecuniary gain, they have only suffered a loss. Those who endure such slavery are as good as lost to the motherland. Their slavery is of no benefit to the country. So long as man is not able to work as an independent individual, the community derives no benefit from his work. Looking at the matter from other points of view, too, it appears necessary that the system of indenture should be stopped. This, therefore, is the evidence that should be tendered before the Commission.

155,,MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [–III],"
  
 We were advised to make a sincere attempt to do our best. The work assigned to us was also light. We had to dig up pits and fill them on municipal land adjoining the main road. This allowed occasional rest. But I found from experience that, left to our conscience and our God, we are shirkers. For I observed that the men slackened in their work.
 It is my confirmed belief that we get a bad name because of this habit of shirking work and also that this habit is one of the reasons why our struggle is being prolonged. Satyagraha is a difficult as well as an easy method Our bona fides must not be in doubt. We bear no ill will to the Government. We do not regard it as our enemy. If we are fighting it, it is with a view to correcting its errors and making it mend its ways. We would not be happy to see it in difficulties. We believe that even our resistance is for its good. It follows from this line of reasoning that we at any rate should work to the best of our ability in gaol. If we believe that we have no moral obligation to work [hard], it is not right that we put in the full amount of work in the presence of the warder. If it is not just that we should work, then we should not submit to the warder, but resist him rather and suffer any further term of imprisonment that may be awarded to us in consequence. But there is no Indian who holds such a view. If some of them do not work [hard enough], there is no more to it than mere laziness and desire to shirk work. It does not become us thus to be lazy or to shirk work. As satyagrahis, it is our duty to do whatever work is given to us; if we worked [as well as we could] without any fear of the warder, we would
 
 be spared all harassment. There would then be no question of our being made to overwork ourselves. Because of the habit of shirking work, people were put to some difficulties in gaol.
 After this digression, let us return to the main story. As days passed, our work became lighter, as I have pointed out above. The batch which included me was next assigned the task of maintaining cleanliness in the gaol garden and looking after its cultivation. Our work was mainly to sow maize seeds, clear the potato bed and dust the potato plants.
 And then, for two days, they took us to dig a municipal tank. Our work there consisted of digging, piling up the earth and carrying it away in barrows. This again was hard work. We had a taste of it only for two days. I had a swollen wrist, which was cured when treated with earth.
 The place being at a distance of four or five miles, we used to be taken there in a trolley. We had to cook our meal near the tank, so that we also carried with us the necessary provisions and fuel. Here, too, the contractor was not satisfied. We could not equal the Kaffirs. After making us work on the tank for two days, they gave us some other work. Hitherto they used to take out mostly such Indians as were strong enough for work. Now, however, they were  formed  into groups. Some of them were sent to dig out the weeds that had shot up round the soldiers’ tombs. Others were sent to clean the graveyard. This arrangement continued for some time. Meanwhile, after the Barberton case, nearly 50 Indians were released.
 During the remaining period, we were assigned work in the garden. This included digging, reaping, sweeping, etc. This cannot be considered to be heavy work; rather, it was conductive to vigour of health. One may at first get bored when engaged on such work for nine hours at a stretch, but one doesn’t feel it after getting used to it.
 Apart from the kind of work described above, it is the duty of the men in every cell to carry the bucket for urine, etc., placed in it. I observed that our people are unwilling to do such work. In fact, there is no reason why one should mind it. It is wrong to think of any work as humiliating or degrading. Moreover, those who have offered themselves for imprisonment cannot afford to stand on prestige thus. I saw that sometimes there was some argument as to who should carry the urine bucket. If we have understood the full meaning  of satyagraha, we would compete with one another in offering to do such
 work, instead of making difficulties about it, and one would feel honoured if the work fell to one’s lot. That is to say, the honour would not consist in being required by the Government to work, but, since the work had in any case to be attended to, he who was the first to offer himself would deserve special honour.
 Since we have resolved to bear all suffering, each one of us may as well come forward to suffer more than others, and he who suffers most should feel most honoured. An example of this was once set by Mr. Hassan Mirza. He has been suffering from a very bad disease of the lungs. He is delicate of health. All the same, he gladly took upon himself whatever work fell to his lot from day to day. Furthermore, he gave no thought to his health. Once, Kaffir warder asked him to clean the chief warder’s privy, which he instantly started doing. As he had never done such work, he vomited. He was not upset by this. while he was cleaning another privy, I happened to come up and see him engaged upon the work. I was astonished. To be sure, I felt great affection for him. On inquiry, I learnt about the first privy. Another time, the same Kaffir warder was ordered by the chief [warder] to find two Indians to clean the latrines specially set apart for the Indians. The warder approached me about this and asked me to name two persons.  I thought I was the best person for such work, and so I went myself.
 Personally, I feel no shame in this kind of work. I think we should accustom ourselves to it. Because of the dislike we feel for such work, not only do we find the front of our houses and our lavatories generally dirty, but also originate, or spread, epidemics such as the plague, etc. We assume that lavatories are bound to be unclean, and thus we frequently invite the charge of being dirty. Once an Indian was sentenced to solitary confinement, that is to say, he was locked up in a cell by himself, for refusing to do such work. Of course, I see nothing wrong in our having to submit to any kind of sentence. But, in this particular case, the penalty could have been avoided. It is, moreover, not proper that we should hold ourselves back from such work. When I set out to attend to the work, the warder began to scold others and urged them to come forward. This spread the news about the order and forthwith Mr. Omar Osman and Mr. Rustomjee ran to my help; the work was very light, though. My object in narrating this story is to show that these men also felt honoured in doing such work when required by the Government. If we are hurt by the nature of the work assigned to us, we cannot take part in any fight worth the name.
 REMOVED TO JOHANNESBURG
 I have given above an account of the work [assigned to us] in Vol-ksrust gaol. But I did not spend two full months in that gaol. I was suddenly sent away to Johannesburg for a few days. What happened there is worth recounting. I was taken there on October 25. The reason was that I was required to give evidence in the case of Dahya, the tailor. There were all kinds of speculations as to other possible reasons. Everyone was filled with hope and imagined that perhaps there might be an interview with General Smuts. It was found later that there was no such idea. A warder was specially sent from Johannesburg to fetch me. A railway compartment was placed at our disposal. We had second-class tickets, the only reason being that there were no third-class carriages in the train. It appears that prisoners are carried only in third-class compartments. I was in gaol uniform throughout the journey. I had some luggage with me, which I was made to carry myself. The distance from the gaol to the station had to be covered on foot. After arriving at Johannesburg, I had [again] to reach the gaol on foot, carrying the luggage myself. The incident provoked strong comments in newspapers. Questions were asked in the British Parliament. Many persons felt hurt. Everyone thought that, being a political prisoner, I should not have been made to walk the distance, dressed in gaol uniform and carrying a load.libtech_477_footnote
 One can understand why this should have given offence to some people. When Mr. Anglia came to know how I was to go, there were tears in his eyes. Mr. Naidoo and Mr. Polak were at the station to see me, having received information [about my arrival]. They were also touched to see my condition. There is no reason why one should feel these things so much. It is not likely that in this country the Government will make any distinction between political and other prisoners. The greater the harassment we suffer, the earlier shall we win our release. Moreover, we shall find on reflection that it is not much of a hardship to have to wear a gaol uniform, or go on foot or carry one’s luggage. But the world will always think of these things as hardships and that is why an outcry was raised in England.
 I did not have the slightest trouble from the warder during the journey. I had resolved [while in Volksrust Gaol] that, unless openly allowed by the warder, I would not take any food other than what I
 
 was allowed in gaol. Hence I had carried on with the gaol diet all these days. But they had given me no food packet for the journey. The warder [accompanying me] allowed me to buy whatever food I wanted. The station master offered me some money. He was also very much upset [to observe my condition]. I thanked him, [but] declined his offer of money. I borrowed 10 s from Mr. Kazi, who was present at the station, and spent something from it to buy food for myself and for the warder on the train.
 It was evening when we reached Johannesburg, so that I was not taken where I could be among other Indians. I was given a bed in a cell of the prison where there were mostly Kaffir prisoners who had been lying ill. I spent the night in his cell in grest misery and fear. I did not know that the very next day I would be taken among our own people, and, thinking that I would be kept in this place all the time, I became quite nervous. I felt extremely uneasy, but I resolved in my mind that my duty required me to bear every suffering. I read the Bhagvad Gita which I had carried with me. I read the verses which had a bearing on my situation and, meditating on them, managed to compose myself.
 The reason why I felt so uneasy was that the Kaffir and Chinese prisoners appeared to be wild, murderous and given to immoral ways.  I did not know their language. A Kaffir started putting question to me. I felt a hint of mockery even in this. I did not understand what it was. I returned no reply. He asked me in broken English why I had been brought there in that fashion. I gave a brief reply, and then I lapsed into silence. Then came a Chinese. He appeared to be worse. He came near the bed and looked closely at me. I kept still. Then he went to a Kaffir lying in bed. The two exchanged obscene jokes, uncovering each other’s genitals. Both these prisoners had charges of murder and larceny against them. Knowing this, how could I possibly sleep? Thinking that I would bring this to the notice of the Governor the next day, I fell asleep for a while late in the night.
 Real suffering lies in this. Carrying luggage and such other troubles are nothing very serious. Realizing that the experience I have had must also sometimes be that of other Indians, and that they too would feel the fear that I did, I was happy that I had suffered in the same way as others. The experience, I thought, would impel me to agitate against the Government all the more tenaciously, and I hoped that I might succeed in inducing prison reforms in regard to these
 matters. All these are indirect benefits of satyagraha.
 As soon as we rose the following day, I was taken to where the other prisoners were lodged, so that I had no chance to complain to the Governor about what had happened. I have, though, resolved in my mind on an agitation to ensure that Indian  prisoners  are  not lodged with Kaffirs or others. When I arrived at the place, there were about 15 Indian prisoners. Except for three, all of them were satyagrahis. The three were charged with other offences. These prisoners were generally lodged with Kaffirs. When I reached there, the chief warder issued an order that all of us should be lodged in a separate room. I observed with regret that some Indians were happy to sleep in the same room as the Kaffirs, the reason being that they hoped there for a secret supply of tobacco, etc. This is a matter of shame to us. We may entertain no aversion to Kaffirs, but we cannot ignore the fact that there is no common ground between them and us in the daily affairs of life. Moreover, those who wish to sleep in the same room with them have ulterior motives for doing so. Obviously, we ought to abandon such notions if we want to make progress.

 I feel unhappy that I was not able to have much talk, rather any talk, with you. But such is my plight.
 I purposely dictated to you that day. I want to make you adept in such work. I would even keep you with me when Ramilibtech_480_footnotelibtech_481_footnoteis grown

Love for you does not consist only in staying with you. At times one has to live apart just for the sake of love. This is true in your case. From every side, I see that your separation is for your benefit. But it can be a source of happiness only if you do not become restless owing to separation. I think Harilal will have to stay at Johannesburg till the struggle is over.
 Considering your stage of life, I do not intend to treat you as a child. I wish you and Manilal take charge of the household. You two have to look after everything in the house, keep Ramalibtech_482_footnoteand Devalibtech_483_footnotein proper form, take care of their belongings, and teach them to do so themselves, see that they are clean and their nails are well trimmed.

157,,LETTER TO “INDIAN OPINION”,"
  
TO
THE EDITOR
INDIAN OPINION
SIR,
 By the time this week’s issue of Indian Opinion is out, I shall perhaps find myself lodged in the gaol-palace. I, therefore, think it necessary to address a few words to the Indian community concerning the present situation.
 There is no doubt that some Indians have weakened. Many of them have given up the fight. Others, it appears, are about to do so.
 A letter has been published in  The Starlibtech_485_footnoteover the signatures of [some] Pathans in which they state as under:
 
 We, Pathans, wish to inform the Government and the public through your paper that the British Indian  Association  has raised a volunteer corps of pickets to keep a watch on the Asiatic Office and the Licensing Office. The pickets are  dressed  in khaki uniform, and wear bands like soldiers. We saw some of them smartly parading up and down the roads. These pickets have been posted with a view to defeating the intention of the Pathans to help the Government and inciting loyal Indians to resist it. And therefore we, Pathans, who have been loyal servants of the late Queen-Empress Victoria, and the present King- Emperor and Queen-Empress—may God save them—consider these volunteers of Gandhi and Polak as bullies. We pray to the Government not to oppose us in what we may do in this connection. Not only does Gandhi always make derogatory remarks about our religion and pass insulting remarks; against our Prophets, but he is ever disturbing the peace [of the land]. If the Government cannot remove him and his corps of volunteers from the Colony, we can do that much for the Government with all despatch. We shall be grateful to you if you give publicity to this letter.
 I have said that the letter is over the signatures of Pathans. I cannot say that it was drafted by them. There was a time when the Pathans sent a petition to the Government to say that they would rather be blown up by its cannon than submit to the law. It is not likely that these very Pathans would submit to the same Act or help others submit to it. Should that happen, it would be a matter of shame for them and for us.
 How, then, did this letter come to be written? I am sure that there is the hand of a well-known Indian behind it. Some whites have been indulging in intrigues against the community in order to protect their own interests. There are some Indians who, having burnt their own fingers, want others to do likewise and thus wish to drag down the entire Community. Both these classes of men want to use the Pathans as pawns in their game. The Pathans, being illiterate, are easily misled and induced to give their signatures. They ought to think before they do so. I should very much like some Indian to read out this letter to them in the right spirit. If the Pathans give their signatures to any sort of letter, without giving thought to its content, they will bedim the lustre of their swords. When a sword is used in the service of a wrong cause, I regard it merely as a piece of rusted iron.
 The man who has written this letter or caused it to be written has held out a threat to the pickets. But the Pathans must realize that it is not proper for them to raise their hand against a single Indian.
 I have not much to say about what has been said against me in the letter. The author of the letter wants to create dissensions among Hindus and Muslims. To charge me with insulting the Prophets of Islam betrays sheer ignorance. I have not even dreamt of such a thing. It is certainly not in the nature of true Hinduism to insult the religion of others. I believe myself to be a follower of that religion. Since my life is devoted to dis-covering the means of uniting Hindus and Muslims, how is it possible for me to insult the Prophets of Islam? But the enemies of the community, anxious to provoke dissensions, circulate all kinds of stories in order to break the bonds that have been forged, seeking to implicate the Pathans also.
 The thoughtful members of the community, and those who want it to prosper, must be alert at a time like this. The first thing is not to be intimidated by threats from any quarter. The community  is  offering satyagraha against the Government, and it will do the same against any Indians who may act as their enemies. It is only Khuda- Ishvar that one must fear. Those who wish to harm the community must be pitied for their ignorance. But one must not be cowed down by them. The fight has been protracted—it will be prolonged still further. Everyone will see that we ourselves are the cause of its being prolonged. Likewise, it is in our own hands to hasten its end. The only way to achieve this is for those who know what the fight means to put their whole heart into it. They must not give way to panic or anger. Moreover, the greater the pressure on us, the more determined should our resis tance be. Accordingly, those who understand the meaning of the struggle should put up with greater losses and bear heavier suffering. It is of the essence of the fight that we should be fearless and rejoice in sacrificing our lives and allowing our property to be ruined, recognizing that only by acting in this manner can we serve our own interests and those of the community. Only thus will the fight be won.
 The attack on Mr. Polak should fill us all with shame. I, at any rate, cannot truly estimate his services to the community. I do not know how to describe his goodness. There is perhaps no Indian who understands the meaning of our struggle so well as he does. The remarks made against such a man in the letter mentioned above show
 
 that we have fallen on evil days.
 I do not know the author of the letter or the man who instigated it. I only pray to God that He may show the right path to that man, to the Pathans and to all Indians, and also that the community may remain firm in the great task it has undertaken.

158,"January 	20, 1909",LETTER TO THE PRESSlibtech_486_footnote,"
           [SIR,]         JOHANNESBURG,  January 	20, 1909 
  	The Indian community is now entering upon the third and, perhaps, 	the final stage of the struggle, which has now been raging for the 	last two and a half years. Hitherto, it has not been necessary for 	the British Indian merchants to sacrifice their goods entirely,  and 	 to reduce themselves to poverty. They have, in order to free 	themselves for the struggle, largely contracted their businesses, 	but not given  them up entirely. The saying that, under an unjust 	Government, only those who countenance and participate in their 	injustice can enrich themselves or retain their riches is about to 	be realised in the present case. In order further to circumvent us, 	and seeing that gaols have ceased to have any terrors for us, ruleslibtech_487_footnotelibtech_488_footnotehave 	been framed under the Criminal Procedure Code, laying down the mode 	of selling the goods of those who may be fined by Magistrates 	without the alternative of imprisonment. This move is clearly aimed 	at Indian merchants. They have, therefore, to face voluntary 	poverty, enforced poverty, or disgrace, They have no desire to 	enrich what is to them an unjust     
 Government at the expense of their creditors or themselves. They have no desire to face disgrace. My advice, therefore, to my coutrymen, both as a merchant and as Chairman of the British Indian Association, is that they must all for the present cease to be merchants, and return the goods they have to their creditors, if any, or otherwise close down their stores. To set an example, I have myself decided to take the first step, and I am doing so with the greatest deliberation, though not without some hesitation. No formal vote of the Association will be or can be taken as to the momentous step. It is most difficult to expect all Indian storekeepers, who have remained hitherto true to the struggle, to sell their all and follow the narrow path chosen by some of us. If they cannot rise to the occasion, I think that, even then, they will have deserved well of their countrymen, if not of the Colonists, in that they have braved dangers and difficulties during the past thirty months. Yet, if we prize our principle better than our pockets, the only advice that I can tender to my countrymen is that they should rise to the occasion and take this final step. Then will the Colonists realise, if they cho[o]se to, that this is not, so far as the Indians are concerned, a struggle for retaining our hold of the trade we have, or for unfair competition, or for bringing into the country men who have no right to be in it. The only question, so far as we are concerned, is that of national   honour   and   our   conscience.libtech_489_footnoteIn   other   words,   we   are endeavouring to show that we are worthy to be citizens of South Africa. It is likely that many Indians, during the last stage of the struggle, may fall. We see, also, that the struggle will be prolonged. Attempts are being made by ill-disposed persons within our own ranks and by interested Europeans to sow dissensions in our own camp. All these things we expected, but they cannot deter us from the course we have adopted; and whether, after many have fallen, we are a small or a large body, our sufferings will continue until justice is satisfied.

        [GENTLEMEN,]     [JOHANNESBURG,  January 	20, 1909] 
  	I regret to inform you that a meeting of my creditors will be 	called, at the Offices of the British Indian Association, 21-24 	Court Chambers, Corner of Rissik and Anderson Streets, as 3  p.m.,  	on Friday, the 22nd inst. My financial position is not the cause of 	calling this meeting, but I, as Chairman of the British Indian 	Association, in view of the determination of the Government to ruin 	the British Indian merchants who declined to accept the Asiatic 	Registration Act until the promise of General Smuts is redeemed, and 	until the status of the educated Indians is placed upon a firm 	footing, can no longer  continue to carry on my trade with safety to 	my creditors or myself. I may state that, evidently on instructions 	from the Law Department, the magistrates are now imposing heavy 	fines upon merchants who trade without licences, without the 	alternative of imprisonment. Rules have been gazetted, laying down 	the manner in which goods are to be sold for these fines.  	In saying this, I do not complain either about the magistrates 	imposing severe penalties or about the Government framing these 	rules. They are in their own estimation entitled to compel 	submission to their laws. I only claim that the British Indians are 	in their turn entitled to resist by their sufferings laws which they 	consider are in conflict with their national honour and conscience. 	Under these circumstances, so long as the struggle lasts, there is 	no course left open to me but to hand over what I possess to my 	creditors, rather than allow those possessions —which, after all, 	I hold in trust for them—to be sold. I am aware that I should also 	consider myself responsible to convert these goods into money, and 	pay my creditors in cash, but my private interests have to give way 	to the public interest, and seeing that I cannot sell my possessions 	by auction, to the advantage of my creditors, I have decided to call 	them together and place my position before them, and ask them to 	take over the goods and my other assets. Should the struggle happily 	come to an end in the near future, or    
 whenever it ends, I should be pleased to take over the goods as they are, and sell them for the benefit of my creditors. But as to  the  disposal of my possessions at the forthcoming meeting, I shall place myself entirely in my creditors' hands.

160,"January 21, 1909",INTERVIEW TO “THE NATAL MERCURY”,"
  
 
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 January 21, 1909]
 Interviewed, Mr. Gandhi says that the steplibtech_491_footnoteinvolves such a large measure of self-sacrifice by the Indian community that, at the present early stage, it was difficult to say whether the Indian merchants, as a whole, would be prepared to adopt the idea, which occurred to him whilst he was in Natal. The creditors of the Indians consisted of wholesale British firms oversea [s], local wholesale and retail firms, banks, storekeepers, and firms in India. If unanimity could be secured among the Indians, the loss sustained by these would run into many thousands of pounds. Wholesale firms in England had supplied largely to the Indian merchants here. If the Indians surrendered their estates, wholesale firms here would be compelled either to cut their losses, or put Asiatic storekeepers in charge, as managers or clerks, which would enable them to trade, despite the registration laws. If creditors, of whatever kind, decided to sell up the Indians, the latter would be amashed, but the former would suffer severe loss. The success of the Indians, Mr. Gandhi said, depended upon unanimity. therefore the Transvaal Indians affected would all be circularised.

 . . . Mr. Gandhi , who spoke for Cachalia, said that it was open to the creditors to take what action they thought fit. His client wished to return the confidence shown in him by the merchants. If they desired, they could use the assets to the best advantage by keeping the business running, or they could sell him out. He could not continue trading.
 Eventually, the Chairman closed the meeting by stating that, as the representative of the majority of creditors, he was not prepared to make any composition, but he would give Cachalia till Monday next as noon to any 20s. in the pound.

 TO
THE EDITOR
SIR,"
162,"January 22, 1909",LETTER TO “RAND DAILY MAIL”libtech_494_footnote,"
  
 JOHANNESBURG,
 January 22, 1909
  	Perhaps you will allow me to pass a few comments upon your 	leaderettelibtech_495_footnoteand 	the remarks made upon what you are pleased to call the“latest 	move” of the British Indian community. I will not go into many 	side-issues that arise out of your remarks; but I venture to say 	that either you do not understand the spirit of the struggle that my 	countrymen have been carrying on, or you do not care to understand 	it. The latest move is not intended to coerce European merchants 	into taking action. Your interviewer received the replies to the 	questions he asked.libtech_496_footnoteThere are, therefore, many gaps to fill up. He took 	away from me only one side of the question.  	In the latest move, Indian merchants do not desire that a single 	European merchant shall suffer. On the contrary, they have  	undertaken voluntarily to suffer even on behalf of their creditors. 	In giving the notice to his creditors, Mr. Cachalia has sinply 	informed the creditors of the danger in which the goods entrusted to 	his care have been placed by the action of the Government—you will 	perhaps add by the action of the British Indians as well. Mr. 	Cachalia presented to the meeting of his  creditorslibtech_497_footnotelibtech_498_footnotea 	 balance-sheet  of  which  any  debtor would be proud, and he made a 	statement before his creditors which I hold to be perfectly 	honourable. He has shown not olny 20s in the £ on paper, but he has 	also stated that he does not desire to receive from his creditors a 	clean discharge against the handing over of his stock to them, but 	he added that he was willing, in the event of any loss being 	incurred on these assets, to make good the loss to the creditors out 	of his future earnings, if he is allowed to make any by the 	Government of the country of his adoption.       
 Nor does the latest move consist in British Indian merchants simply calling a meeting of their creditors, and associating them by force of circumstances in their sufferings to some slight extent. All British Indian merchants are not debtors of Europeans only; perhaps 50% of Mr. Cachalia’s creditors are Indian. In any case, British Indian merchants may be divided as follows: (a) those who have European as well as Indian creditors, (b) those who have European creditors only,
  those 	who have no 	creditors. All 	these three 	classes have been 	advised to 	close down their 	businesses and dispose 	of their 	belogings. You will 	therefore see 	that only to a 	small extent 	will British 	Indians have 	to trouble 	their European creditors. The 	latest move, therefore, 	is not 	a matter 	of any 	coercion at all. If you 	imply that 	European creditors 	will now have 	to take 	greater interest in the 	question, I 	admit the 	charge; but 	it only 	means that 	the suffering 	of my countrymen 	have again told. Passive 	resistance consists purely 	and simply 	in the 	undergoing of 	every variety 	of suffering 	by passive 	resisters. To call 	this defiance 	is a 	prostitution of 	terms; and 	how can the surrendering 	of all 	their belongings, 	including their 	profits, by 	British Indian 	merchants, the 	consequent pecuniary 	loss, and 	the acceptance 	of voluntary 	poverty be called 	a degeneration! 
 You have also remarked upon picketing, and called it intimidation. Picketing, in the case of the Indians, will deserve to be called intimidation, when the missionary efforts of the Salvation Army and other such philanthropic bodies merit the term of open defiance, coercion and intimidation.
 I am, etc.,

  "
163,,WHAT DOES THE STRUGGLE MEAN?,"
  
 The Transvaal struggle can be said to have entered on its third phase. It will be observed from our news-letters that some Indians are now giving in. It also appears that there are rifts among them. This need not depress us. It is so in every conflict. It is very difficult to climb the last steps. There are very few horses in a race; even then, not all of them remain on the course till the end—they cannot. Some of them just stall. Some others get exhausted. Some die while running; only a few reach the destination. The same thing happens in  the history of every community. There is, therefore, no cause for disappointment in the developments mentioned above. In a campaign which produced thousands of Indians who have held out with determination for two years, there are bound to be some who will reach the goal.
 We have yet to secure the repeal of the obnoxious Act and to safeguard the rights of the educated. But that is not the only purpose of the struggle.
 That we should get training in organizing a movement, learn to be resourceful and demonstrate that we are not cowards but men—this also is a part of the meaning of our struggle, but not the whole of it. The main object of this fight is that we should learn to be men, to be a nation, to cease being the goats that we are and be lions, and to show to the world that we are one people, that we are the children of India ready to lay down our lives for her.
 The great Thoreau said that one sincere man is more than a hundred thousand insincere men. We want to know how many of us are sincere. This the fight will tell us. Thus, to learn to be sincere is far more difficult than to secure repeal of the Act. It is wrong for us to get demoralized when we see others giving in. It is such behaviour that is the true mark of cowardice.
 The white nations taunt us with being brave enough to start with, but betraying lack of purpose at the critical moment. We want to prove that we are nothing of the kind. The all-too-powerful Government of the Transvaal will not succeed in proving that we are [pliable] like wax.
 True religion consists in learning all this, and hence we are prepared to sacrifice our lives in this righteous war. To show that we
 are so prepared is one of the objects of the struggle; in fact, that is the main object. As for other things, they will follow as a matter of course.
 Success in such a big task will require an equally big effort. In what way? Businessmen are the most important Indians in the Transvaal. They must prove their worth and be prepared to embrace poverty in the process. It is only by embracing poverty that they can serve their own interests as well as those of the community. In a tyrannical state, only those who subserve its purposes can be happy or grow prosperous. In such a state, it is not straightforward men who can amass wealth. They can live in such a state only if they are prepared to suffer. That is the position of the Transvaal Indians. The Transvaal Government wants to rob the Indians of their honour and wealth. Why should they allow that? In former times, when in any part of the world the subjects rebelled against their oppressive rulers, before joining battle they would first kill their womenfolk in order to save them from dishonour. At the present moment, the Transvaal Indians are engaged in the battle of satyagraha. They will have to sacrifice their money, as women were sacrificed [in the olden days]. If not, they will be dishonoured and find their money as bitter as poison. No religion believes it possible to worship God and Mammon at the same time. Every religion teaches that if one wants to devote oneself to God, one must forsake wealth. Since we started this struggle with faith in God and with prayerful hearts, we must be prepared to renounce wealth. When we stand in need of wealth, that same God will see that we get it.
 In Italy, 300,000 men were buried together with their possessions—such is divine Providence. Keeping that in view, let us always be mindful of our honour. To preserve our honour is in our hands. It is not so with regard to wealth. We hope that the Indians will sacrifice wealth and preserve their honour.

 "
164,,MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [-IV],"
  
 I had one further unpleasant experience in the Johannesburg Gaol. In this gaol, there are two different kinds of wards. One ward is for Kaffir and Indian prisoners sentenced to hard labour. The other is for prisoners who are called as witnesses and those who have been sentenced to imprisonment in civil proceedings. Prisoners sentenced to hard labour have no right to go into this second ward. We slept in it,
 but we could not use its lavatory as of right. In the first ward, the number of prisoners wanting the use of the lavatory is so large that a visit to it is a great nuisance. Some Indians find this a source of great inconvenience. I was one of them. I was told by the warder that there would be no harm in my using a lavatory in the second ward. I therefore went to one of the lavatories in this ward. At these lavatories, too, there is usually a crowd. Moreover, the lavatories have open access. There are no doors. As soon as I had occupied one of them, there came along a strong, heavily-built, fearful-looking Kaffir. He asked me to get out and started abusing me. I said I would leave very soon. Instantly he lifted me up in his arms and threw me out. Fortunately, I caught hold of the door-frame, and saved myself from a fall. I was not in the least frightened by this. I smiled and walked away; but one or two Indian prisoners who saw what had happened started weeping. Since they could not offer any help in gaol, they felt helpless and miserable. I heard later that other Indians also had to go through similar tribulations. I acquainted the Governor with what had happened and told him there was urgent need for separate lavatories for Indians. I also told him that Indian prisoners should never be lodged with Kaffirs. The Governor immediately issued an order for a lavatory for Indians to be sent on from the Central Gaol. Thus, from the  next  day  the   difficulty   about   lavatories   disappeared.libtech_499_footnoteAs  for myself, I had no motions for four days, and hence I suffered in health somewhat.
 While in Johannesburg, I was taken to the court three or four times. I was allowed to see Mr. Polak and my son there. Others also came sometimes. I was even free, when in the court, to have food brought to me from home and accordingly Mr. Kallenbach used to bring bread, cheese, etc., for me.
 When I was in this gaol, the number of satyagrahi prisoners in it mounted very high. At one time, there were more than 50. Many of them were asked to pound gravel with a small hammer, sitting on a stone. About 10 men were employed in mending torn clothes. I was given the work of stitching caps with a [sewing] machine. I learnt sewing for the first time here. It was not difficult work and therefore I learnt it in no time.
 Most of the Indians were employed in pounding gravel. I also asked for the same work. But the warder said that he had orders from
 
 
 the chief warder not to let me out, and accordingly he did not allow me to go out for pounding gravel. One day it so happened that I had no sewing work to do on the machine or other work. I therefore started to read. The rule is that every prisoner must do some work or other assigned to him in the gaol. The warder therefore called me and inquired whether I was ill.
I replied: No.
Q. Why are you then not doing any work?
 A. I have finished the work assigned to me. I do not wish merely to pretend being busy with work. If you give me any work, I shall be glad to do it. Otherwise, what harm is there if I read, having nothing else to do?
 Q. That is true, but it will be better it you remain in the store when the chief warder or the Governor comes round.
 A. I don’t like to do so. I am going to tell the Governor also that there isn’t sufficient work in the store and that I should therefore be taken out to pound gravel.
Q. All right. I cannot on my own send you out for that.
 A little later, the Governor came. I told him everything. He did not allow me to go out for pounding gravel, but informed me that it was not necessary either, since I was to be sent back to Volksrust the following day.
 MEDICAL EXAMINATION — UNDRESSING OF PRISONERS
 The freedom from some regulations which is permitted in the mofussil gaol of Volksrust is not possible in the Central Gaol of Johannesburg. For instance, in Volksrust Mr. Dawad Mahomed was allowed to have a shawi as head-dress, and breeches were allowed to others as well. Mr. Rustomjee, Mr. Sorabji and Mr. Shapurji were permitted to wear their own caps. This will not be easy in the Johannesburg Gaol. Similarly, when prisoners first come to gaol, they are examined by the physician. This is done in order to find out if any of them suffers from a contagious disease and, if anyone does, to give him treatment and isolate him from the others. For this reason, the prisoners are examined with great care. Some of the prisoners are found to suffer from diseases like syphilis, and therefore everyone of them has his genitals examined. For this purpose, the prisoners are totally undressed, while being examined. Unlike the others, Kaffirs are kept standing undressed for nearly 15 minutes so as to save the
 physician’s time. Indian prisoners are made to lower their breeches only when the physician approaches them. The other garments have to be removed in advance. Almost every Indian resents having to lower his breeches, but most of them do not create any difficulty in the interest of our movement, though at heart they feel ill at ease. I told the physician about this. As a special case, he examined some of the prisoners in the store but declined to adopt that as a practice. The Association   has   written   about   this,libtech_500_footnoteand   the    matter    is    under correspondence. We are justified in making an issue of this. This is an old practice of these people,libtech_501_footnotewhich is not likely to be changed all at once. All the same, the matter deserves attention.
 When in the presence of men only, there should be on need to conceal any parts of our anatomy. There is no reason to believe, moreover, that others will keep staring at the parts which we generally hide. We need not have any false sense of shame. If we are pure in our own minds, where is the need to be particular about hiding what is a part of our natural endowment? I know that these ideas will sound strange to every Indian, but I do feel that one must go deep into the matter and learn the right attitude to take. By raising difficulties of this nature, we harm our cause in the long run. Formerly, Indian prisoners were not examined by the physician at all. But once two or three Indians were interrogated. They replied that they had no disease. The physician examined them nevertheless, having felt somewhat suspicious, and found that they had not spoken the truth. He decided thenceforth to examine even Indian prisoners. We can thus see that whenever we are in some trouble, it is generally of our own making.
 RETURN FROM JOHANNESBURG
 As I said above, I was taken back to Volksrust on November 4. This time, too, I was accompanied by a warder. I was dressed in the prisoner’s uniform, but on this occasion, instead of being made to
 
 
 walk, I was taken in a cab. However, instead of second, third-class tickets were provided. By way of provisions for the journey, I was given half a pound of bread and bully-beef. I refused the latter, giving up my claim to it. On the way, I was permitted by the warder to buy some other food. When I reached the station, I found some Indian tailors present. They noticed me. Of course, talking was not allowed. Observing my dress, etc., some of them were filled with tears. Since I was not free even to tell them that I did not mind  my  dress  or  anything else, I merely remained a silent spectator. The two of us were assigned a separate compartment. There was a tailor travelling in the adjoining compartment, who passed on some of his food to me. At Heidelberg, Mr. Somabhai met me. He bought for me some eatables on the station. The woman from whom he bought them at first refused to accept any money, showing her sympathy for our cause. When Mr. Somabhai insisted on paying, she merely accepted a nominal sum of six pence. Since Mr. Somabhai had also sent a telegram to Standerton, several Indians had gone to the station there too, carrying some food with them. The warder and I had therefore more than our fill on the way.
 As soon as we reached Volksrust, I was met by Mr. Nagadi and Mr. Kazi at the station. Both of them walked with me part of the way. They were permitted to walk at some distance from us. I was again made to walk the distance from the station [to the gaol], and carry my luggage. The matter even provoked much comment in newspapers.
 All the Indians were happy to find me back in Volksrust. I was locked up in Mr. Dawad Mahomed’s cell for the night, so that we kept awake till a late hour narrating our experiences to each other.
 SITUATION OF INDIAN PRISONERS
 When I returned to Volksrust, the situation of Indian prisoners had assumed a new aspect altogether. The number of prisoners had risen from about 30 to about 75. There was no way  of  accommodating such numbers in that gaol. Eight tents had therefore been pitched. For cooking, a special chula had been sent from  Pretoria. Moreover, the prisoners were often allowed to go to a river nearby for a bath. The men looked like soldiers rather than prisoners. This was not a prison, but a camp of satyagrahis. What, then, did it matter whether we were treated well or ill by the warders? In fact, most of the warders were on the whole reasonable men. Mr. Dawad Mahomed had given a nick-name to every warder. One was called “
 Oakly”, another “ Mafuto”, and so on.
 VISITORS
 We used to get a good number of Indian visitors in Volksrust gaol. Mr. Kazi was always hanging around. He looked after the prisoners’ affairs outside, putting his whole heart into the work, and seized every opportunity to visit us. Mr. Polak used to come almost every week on official work. Mr. Mahomed Ibrahim  and  Mr. Kharsani came specially from Natal in connection with contributions to the Congress funds by Main Line Indians. On Id day, about a hundred Indian businessmen from Natal must have paid us a visit. There was also a shower of telegrams on that day.
 SOME OBSERVATIONS
 Prisons are generally kept very clean. If this were not so, there would be epidemics before long. But there is also lack of cleanliness in some respects. Blankets are constantly interchanged. A blanket that has been used by the dirtiest of Kaffirs may later fall to an Indian’s lot. Frequently, the blankets are found to be full of lice. They have a nasty smell. Under the rules, they must be exposed to sunlight for half an hour every day, if the sky is clear. But this is rarely done. The difficulty about blankets is not a trivial matter to a man of clean habits.
 The same thing often happens about dress. The uniform worn by a prisoner is not always washed after he is released, but is given to another prisoner to wear in the same dirty condition. This is a disturbing state of affairs.
 Moreover, there was considerable crowding of prisoners. In Johannesburg, where the accommodation was just sufficient for 200 prisoners, nearly 400 were lodged. Thus, twice the number of  prisoners permitted under the rules was often lodged in a cell, and sometimes there were not enough blankets to go round. This was not an inconsiderable difficulty. But it is a law of nature that man adjusts himself to any situation in which he is placed by  circumstances beyond his control. This happened with the Indian prisoners  too. Even in the midst of the very real difficulties mentioned above, Mr. Dawad Mahomed, especially, remained in good spirits the whole day and kept the Indian prisoners amused all the time by his wit and humour.
There was an incident in the gaol which made one unhappy.
 Once a Kaffir warder approached some Indians who were sitting in a group. He asked for two Indians to go with him and do some grass- mowing. No one spoke for some time. Mr. Imam Abdool Kadir then offered himself for the work. Even then,no one got ready  to accompany him. On the contrary, they told the warder that Mr. Kadir was their priest and asked him not to set him any task. This made matters twice as bad. For one thing, everyone ought to have offered himself for the work, instead of which, when the Imam Saheb came forward, out of consideration for the good name of the community, they divulged his status. By indicating their unwillingness to take up the work even when the Imam Saheb was ready for it, they proved that we–the community as a whole–are a shameless lot.

  	I have seen a report of the meeting of creditorslibtech_503_footnotelibtech_504_footnoteof 	 Mr.  A.M. Cachalia of Johannesburg, merchant. I may state that my 	position is very similar to Mr. Cachalia’s. Owing to the action 	taken by the Government, and referred to by Mr. Cachalia, my stock 	is in jeopardy. It is not possible for me to take out a licence. The 	question, therefore, is what am I to do with the stock that is in my 	 possession.  My liabilities are roughly £2,000, and my assets 	£4,000. In view of the decision arrived at by the meeting of Mr. 	Cachalia’s creditors, and in view also of the reported concerted 	action of European merchants regarding cases like Mr. Cachalia’s, 	I am not calling a meeting of creditors, but I merely advise you of 	the position.

         [SIR,]        JOHANNESBURG,  January 	23, 1909 
  	As one-time Secretary of the Indian Association, and as a merch-ant, 	I beg to congratulate Mr. A. M. Cachalia on the most self- 	sacrificing step he has tuken. In my opinion , he deserves the best 	thanks of the Bri-tish Indian community and, more especially, of the 	British Indian mer-chants, for having pointed the way out to them. 	The best manner in whi-ch I can express my approval of Mr. 	Cachalia’s action is to follow him, and I have, therefore, placed 	myself in communication with my creditors.  	I notice that the morality of the step taken by Mr. Cachalia has 	been questioned,libtech_506_footnotelibtech_507_footnotelibtech_508_footnoteand 	that it has been construed into a desire on the part of the British 	Indian merchants to coerce European wholesale houses.libtech_509_footnotelibtech_510_footnoteAs 	to the morality or immorality of the step, it is largely a matter of 	opi-nion. According to the view taught by my religion, a merchant 	who does his best to pay his creditors 20/- in the £, and warns 	them of any danger in which their goods may be placed, is considered 	to have performed a meritorious act deserving of warm approbation 	from the community in which his lot is cast. With reference to 	coercion, I am sure that those who have used the term have done so 	hastily. It is quite clear that if [the] British Indian merchants do 	not take out licences to trade, they  must  be  very properly 	prosecuted for trading without licences. The Government have every 	right, as they consider that their position is just, to impose every 	form of hardship on those traders who trade in disregard of the 	Licensing Law. What is an Indian debtor with a large stock on hand 	and with a conscience to keep to do? He has not cash enough to pay 	out his creditors immediately. He cannot, with any regard for his      
 creditors, and without their consent, sell his goods by auction. He finds he has assets enough to pay out his creditors. Apart from any political considerations, I cannot but think that the only honourable course for a debtor, placed in the position above described, is to take his creditors into his confidence, and place himself at their disposal, telling them that, short of compro-mising his conscience, he is willing to do everything that the creditors may consider desirable in their interests. That my action will bear a political interpretation is unavoidable, for the simple reason that it is based upon the situation created by the Government; but, speaking for myself, I can assure the public that the action that I have taken is irres-pective of whatever the European wholesale houses may do, so far as the political aspect is concerned. My desire is simply to protect my creditors, and certainly also to frustrate the design of the Government, in so far as they wish to receive monetary aid from me in order to bend me and my other countrymen to their wishes, which I hold to be unjust, immoral, and unrighteous.

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 January 25, 1909]
 . . .He [Gandhiji] says that he has sufficient faith in the sense of justice of the Colonists to believe that, as soon as they are in full possession of all the facts, they will give the Asiatics “their rights”.
 The Indians,he said, in the course of conversation yesterday, had secured the Kaffir trade to a large extent, because they treated the Kaffir better and more courteously than the European. He denied that the Indians under-sold the European storekeepers, but admitted that the Indian storekeepers paid their employees less than the European did.
 Replying to the popular reproach that the Indians had ruined Ladysmith and Potchefstroom for European traders, Mr. Gandhi said that Ladysmith was largely supported by the indentured Indian community, just as Verulam was, and it was only natural that Indian stores should spring up there.
 
 said that conferences were to be held at Krugersdorp and Johannesburg to discuss the implications of the move. “Meanwhile, Mr. Gandhi gives the movement active support, and views with much apparent optimism the outcome of the struggle.”
 He concluded by saying that, if the European traders took up so definite and uncompromising an attitude as it was suggested they would do, and if they applied tor the sequestration of the Indians’ estates, so that the latter were turned out of the country, then every Indian would go back to India and become a passive resister.
“ I, personally,” he concluded, “ would endeavour to become a
 thorn in the side of the Indian Government, and I would not be satisfied until the Asiatic trader got his rights in South Africa, or until South Africa were declared no longer a British Colony.”

 [ENCLOSURE] STATEMENT OF THE INDIAN POSITION
 FOR SUBMISSION TO
 THE RIGHT HON’BLE LORD CURZON
 
 THE INDIAN CLAIM
 Apart from matters of detail, the following are the two outs- tanding questions between the Local Government and British Indians:
 Repeal 	of the 	Asiatic Act 	No. 2 of 1907. The 	status of 	educated Indians. 
 ARGUMENT ON THE CLAIMS
 As to the first, the Indian contention is that General Smuts was under promise to repeal the Asiatic Act. The promise was not reduced to writing, but, three days after the completion of the compromise of January, 1908,libtech_522_footnoteGeneral Smuts, in his speechlibtech_523_footnoteat Richmond, which has never been contradicted, stated as follows: “He had told them that the law would not be repealed so long as there was an Asiatic in the country who had not registered,” and, again, “Until every Indian in the country had registered, the law would not be repealed.”
 Apart, however, from the promise, the above Act has been decla- red to be unworkable. The recent decisions of the Supreme Court have emphasised the opinion; and the Act of 1908, which was passed in partial fulfilment of the promise, in effect superseded the Asiatic Act 2 of 1907.
That the Indians understood that a promise had been made to
 
 
 repeal the Act as against voluntary registration can no longer be doubted, and it was in that faith that British Indians submitted to voluntary registration. The leading Indians, in their eagerness to carry out the Indian part of the compromise, did so at much personal risk, as even the voluntary giving of finger-impressions was resented by many Indians. The Secretary of the Association was, on his way to the Registration Office, brutally assaulted, and, later, the then Chairman of the Association was also assaulted for the same reason.
 The giving of finger-impressions as such was never made a funda-mental objection. The objection was raised against the spirit of the Act, based, as it was, on a false charge of an organized entry, on a large scale, into the Transvaal of British Indians who had no right to be in the country.
 As to the status of educated Indians, it is contended that General Smuts puts upon the Immigrants’ Restriction Act of the Transvaal an interpretation whereby British Indians possessing the necessary educational qualifications become prohibited immigrants; and this prohibition is brought about by means of the Asiatic Act of 1907.
 British Indians submit that such prohibition, based on racial lines, is a departure from the Imperial policy; that when the Immigrants’ Restriction Act was sanctioned, such a departure was not intended; and that, in any case, British Indians hold that they cannot accept such racial desqualification involving, in the words of Mr. Chamberlainlibtech_524_footnotelibtech_525_footnote,“an affront upon millions of His Majesty’s subjects”.
 British Indians state that, legal equality for Indians possessing educational qualifications being retained, they do not mind such an administration of the Law as would, under a strict examination test, prohibit the entry of all but six Indians of high educational attainments. Such administrative inequality is today in vogue at the Cape, [in] Natal and Australia; and British Indians, recognizing the prejudice, have submitted to it, but they claim that the importing of a racial difference in the matter of immigration would be intolerable.
 PASSIVE RESISTANCE
 In order to attain this end, British Indians have exhausted all their resources, by way of petitions and deputations. At one of their mass meetings,libtech_526_footnotethey took a solemn oath not to submit to the Asiatic Act of 1907 and not to receive the benefits of the Act of 1908, until
 
   1903     
 the above redress was granted. Many Indians have, therefore, in virtue of the oath, suffered imprisonment. The struggle has lasted now for over two years; and over 2,000 Indians have undergone imprisonment, mostly with hard labour. Hundreds have been deported, only to-return immediately. Many families have been ruined pecuniarily. Many Indian merchants have suffered enormous loss. Some have  even closed [down] their businesses. The Chairman of the Association, in order to avoid confiscation of his property by the Government under fines imposed for trading without licences, has accepted sequestr-ation of  his   estate.libtech_527_footnoteSeveral   Indian   merchants   are   ready   to   follow   his example. Some Indians have, no doubt, owing to their weakness accepted the Asiatic Acts, and more are likely to succumb; but, after a very careful examination, the Executive of the British Indian Association as a whole will remain solid in offering passive resistance until justice is done.libtech_528_footnote

I am pained to see that your 	mind is restless. However, I would always want to know your inner 	feelings. Do not hide them thinking that I shall be unhappy.  	It is not right that you should think you are away from your 	father’s house. I consider you to be my daughter, not a 	daughter-in- law. Had I considered you as my daughter-in-law,  I  	would  have looked upon you as a child. I take you to be my 	daughter, and hence  I do not want to accept that you are a child. 	You have not been able to understand that. Just as I do not consider 	Manilal a child, so also I would not consider you one. Had I kept up 	our relations as between father-in-law and daughter-in-law, that is, 	had I kept  up  such  a distance between us, I would have, in 	accordance with my usual nature, first tried to win you over and 	would have taken work from you freely only when a sense of oneness 	with the family had developed in you. But I had taken it for granted 	that you would forget our relationship of father-in-law and 	daughter-in-law as I have fondled you in my lap as a daughter long 	before you marriage to Harilal.libtech_533_footnotelibtech_534_footnoteYou 	 have  not forgotten that. Try to forget it now.  	I must on no account behave in a way that may cause any harm to you 	or make you unhappy. There have been innumerable women in India who 	saw their ultimate good in separation from their husbands. Damayanti 	became immortal on account of her separation     
 from Nala. Taramati separated from Harishchandra and  that separation led to the good of both. Draupadi’s separation from the Pandavas proved a blessing to them and the entire Hindu nation sings the praises of her resoluteness. Do not think that these instances have not taken place. Lord Buddha left his wife and became immortal and so did his wife. This is an extreme case. By these examples I only want to show you that your separation is not going to do you any harm. That it would cause you mental agony is quite natural. That is a sign of love. But that does not necessarily mean that it will do you harm. Weal and woe depend on the purpose behind separation. My separation from Ba was almost involuntary; that is, it was not of my choice and yet it proved to be a blessing to us both. By giving these examples, I do not want to impress upon your mind that you have to live in separation for ever. I write this so that you are not unhappy over your separation during the struggle. I shall hardly be a cause of your separation after the struggle is over. My effort, however, is to change your mental attitude. That also will be effected after you understand and get used to it.
 Preserve this letter. Read it again and again. Ask me whatever you do not understand. Do both of you read it. My object in writing this is your welfare. I am always eager to promote it. But I do not insist that you should accept my ideas. My only desire is that both of you should grow with your own effort.

173,,CACHALIA’S SELF-SACRIFICE,"
  
 The fact that each successive Chairman of the Transvaal [British Indian] Association has proved himself worthier than his predecessor is an indication that the Indian community’s star is in the ascendant. Mr. Cachalia has been to gaol. He has now declared his intention to embrace poverty. His financial position is so sound that no one can argue that he had little to sacrifice. He is prepared to forgo a flourishing business. He does not mind being declared a bankrupt at the instance of his creditors. Rather he takes pride in that. This is what we can claim as wealth well earned. All this Mr. Cachalia suffers for the motherland. He wants to honour his pledge. This is real self- sacrifice. We offer our congratulations to him.
 This excellent step is already proving infectious. Mr. Aswat has emulated Mr. Cachalia’s courage. We congratulate him as well.
 This is a moment which will test the businessmen. We have often defended them in the past. They have suffered losses. Some of them have also courted imprisonment. We have mentioned  all  such instances from time to time. But this is the time when the businessmen will be really tested. They have never staked their all, as the hawkers did; now is the time for them to do so. Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Aswat
 
 have shown the way. It is to be seen what the other businessmen do. Nearly 40 of them have signed a statement that they will not take out licences, but close down their businesses instead. Those who are prepared for this had better come out in the, open in support of Mr. Cachalia’s action. The next phase of the campaign depends upon the businessmen; it is they who will stand to suffer, should the movement be unduly prolonged.
 Everyone realizes that Mr. Cachalia has not lost his honour by having been declared an insolvent; rather, it has been enhanced. The creditors also know that it is none of Mr. Cachalia’s fault. He has brought distinction to the post of Chairman. Why, then, should the other businessmen feel timid? If at all, what they should fear is a retreat. When engaged in a battle, one can have nothing to fear in rushing forward.

 Indian Opinion, 30-1-1909
 "
174,,ENGLISH INFLUENCES IN THE AIR,"
  
 In these days of swadeshi, it is necessary to bear in mind a few simple things. We observe that some Indian youths, having acquired a smattering of English, use it even when it is not necessary to do so, as if they had forgotten their own language or wanted to suggest how much more difficult it was to speak English, or for some similar reason. When talking among themselves, they use broken English rather than pure Gujarati, Hindi or Urdu. They even carry on their correspondence in English. These young men emphasize their spirit of swadeshi by using difficult English words which they themselves do not understand, and then take pride in what they do. This is a simple, and yet, a grave fault. Any nation that cherishes  its individuality must love its own language and feel proud of it.
 Let us consider the example of the Boers themselves. We are not concerned with their moral principles. Their patriotism, at any rate, is wonderful. That is the only thing that calls for emulation. Though it is very useful for Dutch children to learn English, they are taught their own dialect, a local variety of Dutch called ‘Taal’. There are very few books in this language. But they are confident that in the course of time they will enrich that language. It is possible to do so. It is because of this spirit of theirs that they have succeeded in gathering
 the reins of government in their own hands.
 The Jews love their language, Yiddish, very much, though not as much as the Dutch love theirs. Until a few years ago; that language was only an uncultivated dialect. Some eminent Jews believe that only when they cultivate a real love for Yiddish will they be united as a people.
 In our case, we already have a language of our own; what is necessary is to cultivate respect for it. It is our duty to enrich it, to read a great many books written in it, to write books in it and also to encourage others to write them.
 This does not mean that we need not learn English or can be in- different to it. It is the language of the Government, and has also be come an international language, and hence it is  necessary  for everyone to learn it. One must learn to use it well, when it has to be used. One must learn to read and write in it with facility. But no useful purpose is served by behaving as some young men have been doing. There is no point in writing to another in English when that other person knows as little English as one does oneself. It would only lead to a total mis-understanding, apart from encouraging a bad habit. The right approach would be to use English [only] when the other person does not know our mother tongue. English may be learnt, but one’s mother tongue must not be ignored. The learning of English must come second to learning one’s mother tongue. Or, one may learn both the languages simultaneously, remembering, however,  the general rule mentioned above. We do not believe that those who are not proud of their own language, who are not proficient in it, can have the true spirit of swadeshi. Gujarati, among the Indian languages, is a poorly-developed language, and we also observe that Gujaratis lag behind all the others [in India] in respect of the swadeshi spirit. It is for the Gujaratis to strive for the development of Gujarati. It is in that way that all of us can make ourselves true Indians.

175,,EXAMPLE OF TURKEY,"
  
 The moment a parliament was established in Turkey, the British became respectful. more than 300 members of the House of Commons sent a message of goodwill to the [Turkish] Parliament. Mr. Asquith, who is a minister, was also among the signatories. It  is reported that all the members who were present gave their signatures. Newspapers are now reporting the names of those whose efforts for the establishment of the Parliament were thus crowned with success. In the conflict that Austria provoked with Turkey, the latter gave it a resounding slap in the face without unsheathing its sword, or firing a single shot. Readers will recall that the Turkish people organized a boycott of Austrian goods, which has not yet been relaxed, though Austria has climbed down somewhat. According to newspaper reports, Austrian estimates place the loss Austria has incurred in such a short time at £ 1,700,000. Turkish estimates place the figure at £ 3,000,000. When the ships carrying Austrian goods arrived [at the Turkish port], the Austrian Ambassador made frantic efforts[to have the cargoes unloaded], but the Turkish Government took no notice. Even the porters sacrificed their wages, and not a single Turk was found ready to unload the Austrian goods. The Austrian Government thereupon lodged a strong protest with His Majesty the Sultan. The Turkish people concluded from this the that Austria had  received  an unbearable blow; in the result, the boycott became more intense; First, the fez (the Turkish cap) and matches imported from Austria were boycotted. The boycott was then extended to other articles, as the people came to know what other goods were inported from Austria. Ahmed Reza Pasha, the well known leader of Young turkey, stated when questioned in Paris, that they had certainly boycotted Austria, and that the boycott would continue still. It was not their duty [he added] to think of the losses that Austria would suffer. They had acted in self-defence, only raising their hands to ward off a blow. Austria [he said] had struck the first blow. It might as well enjoy the fruit [of what it had done]. Newspapers report that it was because of this extensive boycott that negotiations started between Istambul and Vienna for a rapprochement.
 This was a struggle for national honour, and neither the poor nor the rich gave a thought to their own losses in defence of that honour; that is the reason why Austria was brought to its knees so
 
 easily. The Transvaal Indians ought to turn this example over and over again in their minds.

176,,MY SECOND EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [–V],"
  
 MORAL DILEMMA
 When I had completed about half the term of my imprisonment, there was a telegram from Phoenix saying that Mrs. Gandhi was seriously ill and asking me to go down immediately.libtech_537_footnotelibtech_538_footnoteEveryone was unhappy at this. I had no doubt as to my duty. When the gaoler asked me whether I would agree to pay the fine to obtain my release, I replied without the slightest hesitation that I would never do so, and that it was implied in our movement that we should bear separation from out kith and kin. The gaoler smiled at this, but felt sorry too. On a superficial view of the matter, this attitude would appear to be rather harsh, but personally I am convinced that that is the only right attitude to adopt. I think of my love for the motherland as an aspect of my religion. It is, of course, not the whole of religion. But religion cannot be considered to be complete without it. If necessary, we should bear separation from our family in order to be able to follow the dictates of our religion. We may even have to lose them. Not only is there no cruelty in this but it is actually our duty to do so. If it is true that we have pledged ourselves to fight unto death, there is nothing further to think of. Lord Roberts lost his only son for a cause inferior to ours and, being on the front, could not even attend his funeral. This history of the world is full of such instances.
 QUARRELS AMONG KAFFIRS
 There are some dangerous murderers among the  Kaffir prisoners in gaol. We find these prisoners constantly engaged in disputes. After they are locked up in the cell, they quarrel among themselves. Sometimes, they openly defy the warder. One warder was twice assaulted by the prisoners. Indian prisoners are obviously in danger when locked up in the same cell with these. So far, Indians have not been placed in such a situation. But so long as Indian
 
 prisoners are classed with the Kaffirs, the danger will remain.
 ILLNESS IN GAOL
 There was for the most part no serious illness among the prisoners. I have already mentioned Mr. Mavji’s case. There was a Tamil named Mr. Raju, who had acute dysentery. He was very much pulled down. The reason he gave for this was that he used to take 30 cups of tea [every day], and he got dysentery because he did not get them. He asked for tea. Of course, the request was rejected. But he was given some medicine, and the medical officer in the gaol ordered two pounds of milk and bread [for him]. This restored him to full health. Mr. Ravikrishna Talevantsingh kept indifferent health till the end. Mr. Kazi and Mr. Bawazeer were ill all the time. Mr. Ratanshi Sodha was observing a religious vow for the four months of the rainy season, and therefore he had only one meal a day. Since the food was not quite satisfactory, he nearly starved himself and as a result got oedema. A part from these, there were other cases of minor illness.
 On the whole, however, we found that even those Indians who fell ill were not broken in spirit. They were happy to bear  this particular kind of hardship for the sake of the motherland.
 SOME DIFFICULTIES
 It was observed that the more irritating difficulties were those of our own making rather than those created by others. There were occasions in the gaol when one sensed in the air distinctions between Hindus and Muslims, between high and low castes. Indians of all communities and castes lived together in the gaol, which gave one an opportunity to observe how backward we are in the matter of self- government. It was also discovered, however, that we were not altogether incapable of self-government, for whatever difficulties cropped up were always overcome in the end.
 Some Hindus said that they were not prepared to take food pre- pared by Muslims or by certain individuals. Men who hold such views should never stir out of India. I also observed that no objection was raised if any Kaffir or white touched our food. It so happened once that someone objected to sleeping near a certain person on the ground that the latter belonged to the scavenger caste. This again was humiliating to us. On probing deeper into the matter, it was found that the objection was raised not because the man [who had raised the objection] was himself particular about it, but because he was afraid of
 
 being declared an outcaste should other members of his community in India come to hear of it. Thanks to these hypocritical distinctions of high and low and to the fear of subsequent caste tyranny, we have, I think, turned our back on truth and embraced falsehood. How can we be called satyagrahis if, knowing that it is wrong to despise the scavenger, we still do so out of an unreasonable fear of members of our caste or other men? I wish that Indians who join this movement also resort to satyagraha against their caste and their  family  and against evil wherever they find it. As for myself, I am convinced that it is because we do not act in this way that the successful outcome of our struggle is being delayed. If it is true that we are all Indians, how can we cling to false distinctions and so quarrel among ourselves and, at the same time, demand our rights? How can we hope to  achieve success in our struggle if, out of fear of what may happen to us in India,we do not do what we believe to be right? It is the mark of a coward to shrink from anything out of mere fear, and Indians who are cowards will not hold out to the last in this great war that is being waged against the Government.
 WHO CAN GO TO GAOL?
 We see from these facts that those who are slaves to bad habits, who observe vain distinctions of caste and community, who are quarrel-some, who are not able to look on Hindus and Muslims with an equal eye and those who are diseased in body—such men cannot go to gaol or remain in gaol for any length of time. It  follows  therefore that those who want to go to gaol as a matter of honour and with a view to the welfare of the motherland must be healthy in body, mind and soul. An ailing man will find himself exhausted in the end; those who are conscious of Hindu-Muslim differences, who think themselves superior to others, who are slaves to bed habits, who are possessed by a craving for tea, smoking or such other things, are incapable of fighting till the bitter end.
 WHAT I READ IN GAOL
 Though the entire day is taken up with work, one can find time for some reading in the mornings and evenings, as also on Sundays and, since there is nothing else to tax one’s attention in gaol, it is possible to read with a peaceful mind. Though I had limited time on my hand, I managed ot read two books by the great Ruskin, the essays of the great Thoreau, some portions of the Bible, life of Garibaldi (in
 Gujarati), essays of Lord Bacon (in Gujarati), and two other books about India. We can find the doctrine of satyagraha in the writings of Ruskin and Thoreau. The Gujarati books were sent by Mr. Diwan for all of us to read. Apart from these works, I read the Bhagavad Gita almost every day. All this reading had the effect of confirming my belief in satyagraha, and I can say today that life in gaol is not in the least boring.
 TWO ATTITUDES
We can take two different attitudes to what I have written above.
 First, why should we bear such hardships, submit ourselves, for instance, to the restrictions of gaol life, wear coarse and ungainly dress, eat food which is hardly food, starve ourselves, suffer being kicked by the warder, live among the Kaffirs, do every kind of work, whether we like it or not, obey a warder who is only good enough to be our servant, be unable to receive any friends or write letters, go without things that we may need, and sleep in company with robbers and thieves? Better die than suffer this. Better pay the fine than go to gaol. Let no one be punished with gaol. Such an attitude will make a man quite weak and afraid of imprisonment, and he will achieve nothing good by being in gaol.
 Alternatively, one may consider oneself fortunate to be in gaol in the cause of the motherland, in defence of one’s honour and one’s religion. Gaol life, one may think,involves no [real] suffering. Outside, one has to carry out the will of many, whereas one has only the warder to reckon with in gaol. One has no anxieties in gaol, no problem of earning one’s livelihood, no worry about getting one’s bread, for that is provided regularly by others. One’s person is protected by the Government. None of these things has to be paid for. By way of exercise, one gets ample work to do and, without any effort on one’s part, all of one’s bad habits fall away. The mind enjoys a sense of freedom. One has ready to hand the benefit of being absorbed in devotions to God. The body is held in bondage, but the soul grows more free. One is in full enjoyment of the use of one’s limbs. The body is looked after by those who hold it in bondage. Thus, from every point of view, one is free. One might, perhaps, be in difficulties, be manhandled by a wicked warder, but then one learns to be patient. One feels glad to have an opportunity of dissuading [him] from such behaviour. It is up to us to adopt such an attitude and think of gaol as  a holy and happy place and to make it such. In short, happiness and
 
 misery are states of the mind.
 I hope that the reader, after reading this account of my second experience [in gaol], will resolve in his mind that his only happiness will be in going to gaol for the sake of the motherland or his religion,
 in submitting himself to the suffering involved in it, or bearing hardships in other ways.

 "
177,,THE TRANSVAAL STRUGGLE,"
  
 
 The Transvaal campaign is now in full swing. The Chairman of the [British Indian] Association is in gaol. Almost all the leaders of the Madrasi community are installed there. Thus, Thoreau’s  statement that in a tyrannical state those who do not wish to submit to its tyranny have their place in gaol is proved true.
 This time, the sentences of imprisonment are not just for a week or   two.libtech_539_footnoteOur   Johannesburg   correspondent   reports   that   the   other leaders will be arrested shortly. We think all this is as it should be. If we had gained our object by a mere pretence of suffering, by being in gaol for a few days, we would not have been able to retain what we had gained, or derive any benefit therefrom. As a rule, we can hold on to anything in the world by the same means by which we gain it. The commonest illustration of this is that of territories acquired by force, which can be retained only by force. Following this logic, some arrogant, power-drunk and thoughtless Englishmen believe that India, which was conquered with the power of the sword, can be held only with the same power. This is an obvious fallacy. We have mentioned it here only as an illustration of the general rule referred to above. We shall therefore say no more than this about it, that they conquered India—not with the power of the sword, but by employing the strength of our own people [against themselves], thanks to the disunity prevailing among them. Therefore, according to the rule mentioned above, India can be retained only by perpetuating that disunity and employing the strength of our people [against themselves]. And
 
 taking this line of argument a step further, we see that if Hindus and Muslims in India were to unite and refuse to hold down their own people, the country would not remain dependent. India could, even then, remain under the British flag. But that would be on a different basis and with the freely-given consent of the people. People’s  consent is there even today. But it is, as it were, forcibly obtained. We shall stop here with the story of India. We only want to draw from it the lesson to be applied to the Transvaal situation.
 We see, then, that it is with those very means which we employ to force the Government to yield our demands that we can  avail ourselves of those demands when conceded. If so, it follows as a matter of course that satyagraha should be employed with full regard for truth. Satyagraha must not be satyagraha only in name. This way of thinking will enable us to bring all our strength into play. That will be of benefit to us. At this moment, if we display real strength instead of being theatrical, that strength will stand us in good stead in future.
 The campaign has now reached a stage  when  everything depends on the businessmen. That is as it should be. It is they whose interests are most heavily involved. They enjoy a higher status [than others]. Therefore it is they who especially feel the disgrace of the Act. Hence, the businessmen must be very careful now as to what they do. Our correspondent reports of numerous businessmen having yielded. Even these, if they have any iota of decency left in them, can join the movement. They can take to hawking in order to court imprisonment. If they mean it, the Government cannot but send them to gaol. Men like Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Aswat are rare in this world. If the Hindu businessmen display even half as much strength, they can serve the movement. Whether they do so or not, those who are already in gaol and those who aspire to be installed in the gaol-palace have a clear duty before them. They must go to gaol again and again till redress is ensured. Let them not mind if their goods are auctioned. If they have staked their lives for the cause, everything else must be accepted as a matter of course. We wish that God should show the right path to Indians. Would it not be a great misfortune for us if, after the publication in England of the letterlibtech_540_footnotelibtech_541_footnoteaddressed by Mr. Hosken and other whites, the Indians were to give way to fear and admit defeat? In fact, that would be the utmost limit of disgrace for us. We are
 
 confident that Indians, who have held out for two years, will certainly not bring on such disgrace upon themselves.

 "
178,,MORE SACRIFICE BY CACHALIA,"
  
 We saw that Mr. Cachalia accepted honourable insolvency for the  sake  of  the  community.libtech_542_footnoteHe  is  now  serving   a   term   of   three months’ imprisonment with hard labour in Johannesburg gaol. From among businessmen, Mr. Amod Moosaji and Mr. Maimy have joined him. The entire Indian community, the Muslims especially, should be proud of what Mr. Cachalia had done. There is nothing more he can do. He has gone to gaol a second time, and that, too, with a smiling face. The community in which there exist such persons will never give way. Even a few such men can save the community from ruin.
 We hope hundreds of Indians will emulate the glorious example of Mr. Cachalia. The greater the number of such Indians who undergo hardships, the more onerous becomes the responsibility of the community. Every Indian should bear this fact in mind. Should the other Indians give in, while Mr. Cachalia and his associates are in gaol, it is not Mr. Cachalia who will lose his good name. It is the community that will be disgraced.
 The Tamils have surpassed all expectations. All their leaders are now in gaol. Now-a-days, imprisonment is not merely for a week, but for three months, and it is not simple, but rigorous. Unbounded is the courage of those Indians who have gone to gaol, undeterred by such sentences. To secure their release before the term of their imprisonment expires is in the hands of the Indians outside. How that can be done is very well shown in our Johannesburg Letter.

179,,CONVENTION,"
  
 The report of the Convention which met to evolve a single Government for South Africa has been published. It is divided into 10 parts, and contains 153 sections. The report will be presented to all the four Parliaments in South Africa on March 30. If it is approved, the Convention will meet again in May at Bloemfontein and present its final report in June, It will be approved by the Parliaments. Dele- gates will then take the report to England and the new Parliament of South Africa will meet within a year thereafter. To some extent, the whites can be proud of all this. We congratulate them on having display-ed a unity of purpose and sacrificed their individual interests. It should not be surprising that men who are capable of acting in this  manner should succeed in their aims; whether or not, as a result of their action, others stand to suffer is a different question. In so far as the Convention itself is concerned, it has proved that men who unite for concerted action, for an unworthy or evil object, will always achieve some measure of success.
 The Convention will lead to the establishment of a single Parliament and a single High Court for South Africa. Subordinate to the Parliament, there will be a council for each of the present Colonies for its internal affairs. The council will have power to enact ordinary laws. There will be uniform customs and a single railway. Pretoria will be the permanent capital, but one session of Parliament will be held in Cape Town. The new High Court will be located at Bloemfontein. There will be one Governor-General for South Africa. Parliament will have two Houses, the Senate and the Assembly. There will be 40 members in the Senate, of which eight will be nominated by the Government. The rest will be elected by the several provinces. The Assembly will have 121 members, 51 from the Cape, 17 from Natal, 36 from the Transvaal, and 17 from the Orange Free State.
 The proposed Union has dangerous implications for Indians  and other Coloured races. They will be left with no voting rights anywhere, and care has been taken to provide in the report that they should be deprived of whatever little measure of such rights they enjoy in the Cape. But franchise is a mere trifle. Where we are not allowed even standing room, voting rights can be of little avail. In a place where some are slaves and others masters of slaves, they may
 have the same voting rights for the purpose of appointing supervisors over them both, the slave’s vote will be of no use to him. Before the right can be of profit, the slave must be made free and educated to value his freedom. Otherwise, voting rights will hardly be worth the name. In this land, we are in a state of slavery. We have not even been educated to understand the meaning of freedom. We must have both at the same time. It is not likely that those who are our masters will break our bonds. Therefore, we have to educate ourselves and win freedom for ourselves by our own efforts. Till that is done, the franchise, in our opinion, will have no value. Let us therefore come to the other kinds of shackles [being forged for us] by the Convention.
 The existing laws of the several provinces will remain intact, that is, whatever laws against us exist in the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal and elsewhere will remain unchanged. We shall be allowed no right of movement from one province to another; moreover, the new Parliament will be empowered to enact fresh legislation.  The result will be that the harshest laws that exist in any of the Colonies or provinces will be taken as models elsewhere.
 It is evident from the report of the Convention that it has not solved the Indian question in the Transvaal. And should the Indians remain inactive, they would be reduced to a miserable condition all over South Africa. Any Indian who would rather not live as a slave in South Africa must understand this and, if he belongs to the Transvaal, must join the fight, staking his head on it; if he is from outside the Transvaal, he must extend all possible support and encouragement to the Transvaal Indians.

 "
180,,TO THE FALLEN,"
  
 Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp have fallen. It appears that  Indians in other towns have also given in. Potchefstroom has even sent a report to newspapers to the effect that since that town, which has been so firm, has fallen, other towns are bound to follow suit and that [consequently] there will be no more of satyagraha.
 To those who have fallen, we want to give some idea of the duty that they owe. They know of course that the movement is worth carrying on. They gave in because they could not bear the sacrifices it
 involved. Those who have fallen in this way must not think  of bringing down others. They can even inform the Government that they have surrendered owing to their weakness, that they wish success to those who are standing firm and that they will do everything they can to strengthen these. This much they can certainly do. If they do not, it will be assumed that they did not give in out of weakness, but that they deliberately turned enemies of the motherland. They can give statements in newspapers to say that, though they have themselves fallen, they do not want that others should do the same.
 If they do not act in this manner, the campaign will certainly not be wound up for that reason. It will continue. But it will be prolonged if they range themselves on the opposite side. If they admit their weakness in having surrendered, to that extent they will have helped the cause. The campaign will be the shorter for that.
 Moreover, even those who have fallen can go to gaol, if they choose. When, in Italy, the people had the spirit of patriotism flowing in every vein of theirs, those who did not join the fighting would not obstruct it but, admitting their weakness, remained aloof and even helped in many other ways. The Indians who have surrendered can do likewise. They ought to heed these suggestions. They ought to have thought of Mr. Dawad Mahomed and others and remained firm. Since they have not done so, they can at any rate act as suggested above and so refrain from adding to the sufferings of these men.

 "
181,,181 RANDERI APPEAL,"
 We have lost Mr. Randeri’s appeal.libtech_543_footnotelibtech_544_footnoteThis was not unexpected. It was evident from the attiude of the judges in Mr. Naidoo’s case that this appeal, too, would be rejected. Both these appeals are a sort of hint to the satyagrahis that they must appeal to God alone. The courts of this world cannot help them. How can they? The courts of a blind king must also be blind. This does not mean that the officers of the court—the judges—were blind. But there can be no other result when the officers administer an unjust law. Therefore, a satyagrahi’s appeal lies to his own strength, to his faith in God and  his  God-given  strength. These will never fail him.
 Some Indians appear to have lost heart altogether because of [the outcome of] this appeal. They seem to have received a rude shock. These Indians should be taken to be cowards. “Ah misery! Nothing but deportation is left!” But what does “deportation” mean? When deported, one is to return. If one must choose between imprisonment and deportation, deportation is better in some ways, for  a man who is deported can continue to fight. The rejection of the appeal does not mean that we have lost our rights. Rights will be lost only when we forgo [them]. Those who have made the Transvaal their home will not allow themselves to be driven out by the Government. They may leave of their own accord. We must therefore advise everyone to think no more about the Randeri appeal.

182,,DUNCAN’S VIEWS,"
  
 Mr. Patrick Duncan was Colonial Secretary in the Transvaal before it received self-goverment. Recently, he took a leading part in the Convention. State is an important monthly journal in South Africa. Only very prominent persons write for it. It is patronized by white millionaires.
 To this monthly, Mr. Duncan has contributed an article on the Asiatic question that is of serious import and worth reading. They author, moreover, is a man of such vast influence that he can [if he chooses] get the Indian demands accepted.
 Those who know English may read this article in that language. We do not have space enough to give a translation, nor is it necessary to do so. Much of it is past history, which is quite familiar to all Indians.
 What is remarkable in the article is that is concedes that our demand is reasonable. It also shows conclusively that Mr. Smuts had entertained the thought of repealing the Act. It points out, further, that the Government felt heavily the pressure of satyagraha. In brief, the article offers conclusive proof that the Government cannot but yield to that pressure. All this is important. But the most important point is that the article shows why the Government has not yielded so far. Well, Mr. Duncan asserts categorically that the problem of [the immigration of] educated Indians is a serious one. Whether they should be given in
 law the same freedom of immigration as the whites is the main issue. How can it be allowed? Mr. Duncan argues that if South Africa is to be settled by a predominantly white population, such freedom cannot be allowed. He says, moreover, that the problem is not limited to the Transvaal, but concerns the whole of South Africa, This realization led the Imperial Government to sanction the Immigration Law. It is the same realization which has led all the whites to resist [the Indian demand], and which accounts for the continuation of the [Indian] campaign. If the Transvaal Indians withdraw their campaign, there will be identical legislation in the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia. If the  Transvaal Indians continue the struggle, it will not be possible to enact such a law for the whole of South Africa. Mr. Duncan has discussed these ideas at great length. One may infer from this that the solution of the Indian question will be found only after the Convention has concluded its labours.
 However, before that stage is reached, we already hear people saying that the satyagraha has collapsed. If there is to be no more of satyagraha, why brother about the Convention? We are, of course, not bothered about the Convention, but satyagraha will not on  that  account be abandoned. All the Indians who fought for two years got a taste of this way of fighting. They realized something of its beauty. It is possible that they may give up fighting now. But evven if a majority of Indians give up the fight, that will not mean the end of the movement. It will go on so long as there is one single person to carry it on. It is, however, our duty to commend this article of Mr. Duncan’s to the attention of those who have not yielded so far, and they, on their part, must note Mr. Duncan’s words and carry on the fight.

183,,DAWAD MAHOMED’S PATRIOTIC SERVICES,"
  
 Mr. Dawad Mahomed, though nearing old age, has been rendering wonderful services to the community. They deport him, but he is not deterred. Imprisonment holds no terrors for  him. “No matter at what point on the border the Government sets me free, [ I shall go where I like, even as cattle do]”. He has smilingly repeated this remark to a number of men. Serving repeated terms of imprisonmment and indifference to wealth are no longer rare among
 Indians in South Africa. We have already written about the invaluable services of Sorabji, who opened the second stage of the stayagraha. He goes on doing his duty silently, whether inside the goal or outsidde it. But this time it is of Mr. Dawad Mahomed’s services especially that we wish to write. A man’s work may be appreciated in two ways. First, with reference to its intrinsic wortth, and second, with reference to the results, that is, by an asseessment of its likely effects on other men in future. From this second point of view, no one can equal the services of Mr. Dawad Mahomed. It is not merely that he is the President of the Natal Indian Congress. He is a resident of South Africa of long standing. There must be very few Indians in South Africa who are his equals in resourcefulness. He is so intelligent that, had he known English, he would be occupying a big position today. He has a remarkable power of raillery with which he can chaff a great many people with effortless ease. He has had a long experience. He has been free with his money in helping people. He has done good turns to a number of men, either by putting in a good word for them or by offering them monetary help. He is a staunch Muslim, and exerts a powerful influence on the Surati community. For these reasons, his activities have proved to be of immense value from the point of view of their effect. We do not believe that any Indian in South Africa can be content to leave Mr. Dawad Mahomed in gaol. His continued imprisonment has made it the duty of the Indian community to intensify the campaign. The reader will now see why it is that Mr. Dawad Mahomed’s part [in the movement] should be considered so very important, and we hope that every reader will be of this view and do his best to help the struggle. If this is done, we believe that Mr. Dawad Mahomed and his associates will not have to complete the full term of six months’ imprisonment. Even if they have to, and be imprisoned again thereafter, what will it matter? They will earn  thereby all the more enduring fame, and we who remain outside shall have an evil name. What Indian is there who wants to avoid imprisonment at the price of inviting disgrace upon himself?

 We give in this issue a report to the effect that the Asiatic law which had been passed in Rhodesia, Similar to the Transvaal measure, has been disallowed. This is not a small thing. We must remind readers that the petition which was submitted against the Bill had referred to the resolution of the Indians not to submit to it if it was approved. Everyone will be able to see that the Transvaal fight is the main reason for the disapproval of the Bill. The Imperial Government is forced by the newly-acquired strength of Indians to act very  cautiously.  We hope the Indians will not readily allow this strength to vanish.

185,,DUTY OF INDIANS OUTSIDE THE TRANSVAAL,"
  
 It appears that the Transvaal struggle will be prolonged and also that there will be very few Indians now to take part in it. It has become doubly obligatory upon the Indians outside the Transvaal to help them. They can do so by holding meetings and passing resolutions. This will serve two purposes. One, those who have not given in yet will feel encouraged, and those who have may join the battle again. Two, the rulers will realize from such meetings and the resolutions passes there that the Indians are united in continuing the fight. Besides passing resolu-tions, it is necesary to collect funds. How much money will be needed in the Transvaal cannot be judged. But it has become imperative to remit some money to Mr. Ritch in England. We don’t here enter into the question whether the Committee should continue to be maintained or not, but at least six months will elapse before the Committee is wound up. There is no option but to maintain the Committee till then. The Transvaal sent money to Mr. Ritch only recently. It will be therefore difficult to spare more funds [just now] from the Transvaal. Hence it is the duty of Indians in the  other Colonies to shoulder this burden. Our eyes turn especially to Natal. It has played its part till now in maintaining the Committee and so we hope that it will do its duty this time as well.

186,,THE STRUGGLE,"
  
 Readers of this journal will see from our columns this week that the Government have now begun to single out those passive resisters who have proved themselves strong, staunch and true. In this we think the Government deserve congratulations from all parties. At the rate the Government are going on, we should soon have most, if not all, of the passive resisters in gaol. We should find out the true from the false, and the Government will have provided a demonstration for themselves and also for the Colony that real passive resisters are not concerned with an Asiatic influx into the Colony. They are not concerned with bolstering up fraud. All they care for and all they are fighting for is the good name of the community to which they belong, and if it suits the Government to keep such men in gaol for the term of their physical lives, it will suit passive resisters also admirably. The honour of the community will be safe in their keeping, even though they may be in gaol. They will have kept their sacred oath. They will have lived up to the religion they professed. More cannot be expected of man. The Government may then, if they choose, pat themselves on the back for having put passive resisters out of harm’s way, but the world will have then seen the righteousness of the struggle in a manner it could not have done otherwise.
 There is no such word as defeat in the dictionary of passive resisters, for the simple reason that, in passive resistance, there is no trial of brute strength in which one must necessarily yield.

 "
187,,THE CONSTITUTION,"
  
 The more the Draft Act of Union is examined, the less it appeals to us. It seems to be a document redolent of race-prejudice, reaction and weak compromise. The more we read it, the more it seems lacking in principle. An enormous effort was evidently made to deprive the Coloured voters at the Cape of their franchise rights, and even under the Constitution as it stands today, there is the chance, though it may be a remote one, that they will, in fact, be deprived of their electoral privileges. We understand that Section 35 has met with the approval in advance of the Imperial Government. That in no way surprises us,
 after the lesson of the Transvaal. The Natal Coloured voter fot the future is actually disfranchised. His future privileges are specifically taken away by the Draft Act of Union, and he is left in the lurch. Then, again, although the Cape will get an increase in representation in the course of time, such an increase will be based only upon an increase in the European population. The Coloured  population  is again ignored, and this increase of membership for the Cape will, in due couse, be balanced by an increase of membership for the other Colonies on a similar basis, so that the Cape’s advantage will have disappeared. Mr. Lyttelton knew well what he was talking about, when, in commentig upon  the Constitu-tion, he urged that, in the consideration of it, the position of British Indians in the Transvaal should be regarded with care and sympathy. That seems to apply all round. Frankly, we would rather see Closer Union, however admirable in itself it may be, postponed indefinitely, than that it should be accomplished at such a cost to the Empire, It will be worse than building upon sand.

 "
188,,PARSEE BRAVERY,"
  
 We have mentioned the Tamils’ bravery. Besides Mr. Chettiar, a number of Tamils are at present in gaol, so that they have certainly not allowed the light of the community to be dimmed. Mr. Pillay, Chairman [of the Committee] at Pretoria, has also been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Like the Tamils, the Parsees, too, have shown themselves to be brave. It is one of the supreme wonders of God that, though the Parsee community does not number more than a hundred thousand in the whole word, it has made a name for itself everywhere by virtue of its many illustrious qualities. It can be said that it is this community which holds power in India. Bombay is the real capital of India, [and] it owes its prosperity mainly to the Parsees. Examples of their charity are to be found everywhere. They lead in the political field and India has had so far only one “Grand Old Man”, Dadabhai. It could not be that members of such a community should behave differently in South Africa. We can say about the Parsees, as about the Tamils, that they have been fighting to a man. They are very few in South Africa, but, as we look round, we do not find a single Parsee who has complied with the Government’s senseless law. Out of the five to seven Parsees in Natal, as many as
 three are installed in gaol in the Transvaal. Mr. Nadirshah Cama sacrificed his job and has now been arrested; we hope he will shortly be imprisoned. His brother, Mr. Ardeshir Cama, has also been  arrested. Elsewhere, Mr. Mulla Bupu Feroze has also been arrested. The other Indians ought to take a lesson from this. We congratulate members of the Parsee community. Their prestige is the prestige of all Indians, for they too are Indians. Other Indians, Muslims and Gujarati Hindus should hang their heads in shame before the Tamils and the Parsees. When we have the example of these two communities in our midst, why shoud we cite examples from others in order to whip up the Indians’ courage? The Tamils and the Parsees have achieved a great victory for themselves, and though, at the end of the struggle, the entire Indian community will benefit by it, the credit will be theirs alone. They will be the rulers. They alone will deserve that position. The rest of us will be looked upon as subjects.

 "
189,,WILL INDIANS YIELD?,"
  
 Picking up some newspapers just now, we read how 500 men, who had gone to see a play in Mexico, were burnt to death in a fire in the theatre, and how 200 miners were buried [in a mine] in Durham in Britain owing to an explosion. It is only a few days ago that we read about the death of a large number of men when heavy rains caused the flooding of some mines near Johannesburg.
 Though we receive such mysterious warnings from time to time, we turn back from the tasks that we may have resolved on. We fail to accomplish them either through fear of pecuniary loss, danger to our lives or other similar misfortunes. Day and night we  are  busy guarding out bodies from harm, though we cannot take their safety for granted even for an hour. For reasons such as these, the Transvaal Indians are turning back just when the ship is about to gain the shore; such behaviour brings no credit to Indians, is indeed unworthy of them. The greatest charge against us is that we lack the spirit of manliness, that we make a big effort for a while, but soon set tired of it, and that we do not put all our heart into anything that we do. It is one of the objects of the Trans-vaal movement that this charge should be disproved. From it is very nature, the movement will test most of the virtues of Indians or expose their faults. Naturally, therefore, a
 number of things are involved in it.
 Indians ought to realize that in this campaign no one is to wait for a lead from others [or] to point to others in justification of one’s own lapses. Everyone must put his own courage to the test. We must remember that the people whom we are fighting have themselves passed through many sufferings. Only 300 year ago, they had heroes who preferred being burnt alive to betraying their principles. There was a white man of holy character, John Bunyanlibtech_545_footnotelibtech_546_footnoteby name, whom the whites adore today, but who in his life-time suffered much, having had to serve a harsh term of twelve year’s imprisonment. In those days, gaols were veritable dungeons. It was only for his principles that John Bunyan suffered. In his time, men were put into prison if they did not attend a particular church. John Bunyan would not attend under compulsion even the most hallowed church. And for this he suffered imprisonment. He was as happy in gaol as if it were a palace. While there, he wrote a book which hundreds of thousands of whites read with great devotion. It is believed that there are very few books like it in other languages. This John Bunyan did not concern himself with what others did. All that mattered to him was his own principles; these he refused to betray, preferring to remain in gaol. He  won, nevertheless. Even today, those who threw him into prison  are despised by the world. Moreover, the imprisonment of a man like John Bunyan won freedom for his people. It is with the fellow- countrymen of such a man that we have to deal. We take that to be our good fortune. We cannot learn respect for a principle from a man who has much less of it than we have. In the company of a jackal, one can learn to be a jackal and nothing better, but in a lion’s company one must learn to roar like a lion or face annihilation. We find ourselves thrown among such lion-like whites, who are extremely oppressive in their dealings with us. If we look at the matter in the right perspective, we shall succeed in holding our own against them, shall save ourselves from being reduced to slavery and live in freedom as their equals in the Transvaal. We have ventured through this campaign to claim equality with them, and success in the venture requires true knowledge and true education. True knowledge is not mere literacy, and true education, not mere reading of books. True knowledge and true education consist in knowing and understanding our true state, and in fashioning our lives and conduct in the light of that knowledge.
 
 It will be observed from our Johannesburg Letter that the Government has now started arresting men everywhere. It arrests everyone known to be strong. We congratulate those who are arrested. We pray to Ishvar—Khuda to keep up their courage till the end. Their daring will ensure a bright future for the Transvaal Indians, for the Indians of South Africa—in fact, for the whole of India. The fact that they are a small minority need not dishearten them. It is quite plain now that those who have not been arrested have yielded. We can generally assume that they have come to an understanding with the Government. It is true that there are several Indians, unyielding in their attitude, who have not been imprisoned. They will also find themselves arrested by and by. But a time is coming when almost all true satyagrahis will have been installed in gaol. It is therefore our emphatic advice to those who would strike with all their strength to come forward fearlessly and boldly [to court imprisonment]. Let them no be anxious as to who would attend to the work [outside] in their absence. God is present everywhere—behind, in front, to the right and the left, above and below. He is our only support. He will provide for everything. Why, then, depend upon the efforts of any human being? What can a human being do, after all? The brave Mr. Aswat will be in gaol in a few days. We hope that he will be followed by Chairman after Chairman, in a long line. We repeat once more that those Indians who have fallen can spring back again to their feet with a roar. All that they have to do to make themselves free is to tear off their licences, to make a bonfire of their certificates.
 We have never known circumstances so favourable as in the Transvaal for giving a fight. How is it that Indians fail to notice this opportunity? If they have noticed it, it passes our understanding why they do not grasp it.

190,,NEW WINDS BLOW,"
  
 The newspapers have reported that Dar-e-salam Indians propose to do what Natal Indians could have done. They want to boycott the German East Africa Linelibtech_547_footnotesince it does not book Indian passengers in
 
 the first class and refuses to accept responsibility for loss of luggage, etc. There is a Reuter telegram to this effect from Berlin. Traders have decided not to book their goods on the steamers of this Line. They have gone to the length of saying that they will commission their own steamers if the Company’s officers do not behave respectfully and conduct themselves properly. We thus find that the winds of self- respect and patriotism are blowing on every side. Everyone feels that Indians will sink into utter insignificance or be squeezed out of existence like fleas if, at this time when the nations of the world are competing with one another, they do not wake up and assert themselves.

VOLKSRUST,
 Thursday [February 25, 1909]
 Today Messrs M. K. Gandhi, Somabhai Patel and six others were sentenced under the Regulations for refusing to produce certificates of registration and to give finger-prints or other means of identification, to a fine of fifty pounds or to undergo imprison-ment for three months with hard labour. All went to gaol.
 Addressing the Court, Mr. Gandhi said:
 It is my misfortune that I have to appear before the Court for the same offence the second time.libtech_550_footnoteI am quite aware that my offence is deliberate and wilful. I have honestly desired to examine my conduct in the light of past experience and I maintain the conclusion that, no matter what my countrymen do or think, as a citizen of the State and as a man who respects conscience above everything, I must continue to incur the penalties so long as justice, as I conceive it, has not been rendered by the State to a portion of its citizens. I consider myself the greatest offen-der in the Asiatic struggle, if the conduct that I am pursuing is held to be reprehensible. I, therefore, regret that I am being tried under a clause which does not enable me to ask for a penalty which some of my fellow objectors received, but I ask you to impose on me the highest penalty. I desire to thank the Court and the Public Prosecutor for the courtesy exte-nded to me in granting so long a delay on account of my wife’s illness.
 The Magistrate, in passing sentence, said: As I stated before, it is a matter of opinion. You have your opinion. I can only act in accordance with the law. As you do not ask for different treatment, I shall treat you as I have treated others in the same position.

193,"February 25, 1909",MESSAGE TO INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_551_footnote,"
  
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 February 25, 1909]
 I am happy that I am going to gaol again. The only regret is that I received only three months’ imprisonment, whereas other satyagrahi patriots have received six months.
 As I go to gaol, I see that many Indians have given in. It is left only to a few Indians to continue the campaign now. I am undeterred by this fact. In some ways, it can be more vigorous now.
 Those who have fallen can rise again. They can [still] go to gaol. I hope they will rise.
 Even if they cannot, they can offer monetary help, and send statements to newspapers to say that, though they have surrendered, they are in favour of the fight and wish it success.
 Men of education outside the Transvaal can enter and be installed in gaol. If they do not do this, they can serve as volunteers at meetings wherever they are. It is the duty of all Indians in South Africa to hold meetings, pass resolutions and send telegrams.
 This is a fight on behalf of religion, that is, on behalf of the [universal] religion which underlies all religions. Had I not believed so, I would never have advised the community to invite grievous suffering on itself, I believe that sacrificing one’s all in a struggle like this should in no way be difficult. It is the duty of every Indian to forget all thought of relatives and friends, to sacrifice wealth and life, in this struggle. I pray to God, and beg of Indians that all of them fulfil this duty.
It lies in our own hands to shorten the campaign.

TO MY TAMIL BRETHREN
 BEFORE GOING TO GAOL FOR TH E THIRD TIME IN OUR STRUGGLE
 I have addressed a letter in Gujaratilibtech_553_footnotelibtech_554_footnoteto our countrymen, but, as I do not know the beautiful Tamil language sufficiently, I write to you in English, hoping that I may reach some of you. The struggle has not reached the most critical stage. Whilst the majority of the  other sections of the community have fallen, being too weak, the majority of the Tamils and the Parsis have stood firm. The brunt of the battle must, therefore, fall upon their shoulders. I pray to God that He may give you sufficient strength to bear it. You have discharged yourselves brilliantly hitherto. Remember that we are descendants of Prahladlibtech_555_footnotelibtech_556_footnotelibtech_557_footnoteand Sudhanva, both passive resisters of the purest type. They disregarded the dictates even of their parents, when they were asked to deny God. They suffered extreme torture rather than inflict suffering on their persecutors. We in the Transvaal are being called upon to deny God, in that we are required to deny our manhood, go back upon our oath, and accept an insult to our nation. Shall we in the present crisis do less than our forefathers?

 I am sorry not to have any letter from you. I see that Ba is getting better. Please read good writings and poems to her. Always write to me after consulting her and let the letters be signed by both Manilal and you. You may ask Ba what she has to say and let me know that also.
 Let me know about your own health as well as the condition of your right ear, feet and cough.
 The change that I made in your diet is to be adhered to as an order from me. Take sago and milk regularly. Feed Rami at the breast for a few days more. Take sufficient food after feeding her also. Your health will not improve so long as you do not get open air. I neet not write more.
 Ask Willielibtech_558_footnotenot to do any mischief at all. If Ramdas has a sore throat, apply an earth bandage.

196,,M. A. EXAMINATION,"
 than you. Please 	read out this letter to Ba.  From 	a photostat of the Gujarati original in Gandhiji’s hand: S.N. 9525       	Much is at stake in the Transvaal struggle, and therefore we have 	been writing on it frequently and at some length. That seems to be 	the only right thing to do. We submit to all Indians that the 	community will not chance upon such a struggle again. It is no small 	matter that the fight has reached the present stage.    
 But some Indians have been asking: “Hundreds have yielded. What is the point in continuing the fight?” We think this betrays lack of understanding. If some Indians have yielded, the same thing has been true of other armies. There is nothing unusual in that.
 The fight in which we are engaged at present is a kind of examination which we are to take. We have been studying [as it were]. Everyone came forward to study. Thousands went through the first grade. Some got tired of their studies when they came to the second grade. They left off. In this manner, we reached the seventh grade.libtech_559_footnoteThings became rather difficult. A large number gave up. Even so, a considerable number reached the matriculation stage. But only a few had the courage to venture beyond that, though the number was not very low.
 And now we are on the last stage. We are to qualify ourselves for the M. A. degree. That surely cannot be done by people in their hundreds. Only a few will succeed. Can it be said that those who appear at this examination are defeated because the rest did not offer themselves for it? No; it cannot. Those who take the M.A. degree will certainly have emerged victorious; not only that, but those who lagged behind will also share in the glory.
 Thus, we liken the satyagrahis who still remain staunch to candidates for the M.A. degree. They should not in the least feel disheartened; rather, they should be proud that they have remained steadfast so long. There can be only a few highly educated men in any community. But, though small in number, they are of the greatest help. That is the situation in the Transvaal. Maybe there are only a few Indians still who are left fighting; but the highest value should be attached to the part they are playing.

197,,HELP FROM NATAL,"
  
 We congratulate the [Natal Indian] Congress on having held a meeting in support of the Transvaal campaign. In our  view,  the meeting was rather thinly attended, not much enthusiasm having been in evidence, and it had not been called as expeditiously as it should have been, so that we rest content with the mere fact of the meeting having been held, on the principle that something is better than nothing.libtech_560_footnotelibtech_561_footnoteAll the same, the Natal leaders will be blamed for their lapse to the extent that they were found wanting.
 We believe that they ought not to rest content merely with a meeting. The Government will arrest as many persons as it wants to, and then watch the fun. But Indians outside the Transvaal cannot afford to sit back.They must send frequent cable reports to India, revive the spirit of those in the Transvaal who have fallen and by such means focus public attention on the struggle all over the world. If that is done, the gods of heaven will descend to watch the battle that will ensue. If not, Indians will be ridiculed and lose their foothold in South Africa in the near future.
 We spoke of a Natal meeting. Really speaking, it was only a Durban meeting. What has happened to Maritzburg and the other towns in Natal? Why should they not hold meetings? The main Line dispute has not yet been resolved. People are preoccupied with questions of prestige and dignity while their brethren are in gaol. This is not dignified behaviour. The Main Line dispute ought to be resolved. Even if it is not, work can be carried on in the other main towns of Natal.
 What is Natal’s duty is also the duty of the Cape, Delagoa Bay and other places. Cablegrams should be dispatched to England from all these places. Money too will be needed for such an agitation; for this regular provision should be made. It every Indian does his duty and performs the community’s tasks in the same spirit that he does his own, it will not be surprising to see India being forged into a nation in South Africa.

199,"March 11, 1909",DRAFT PETITION TO GAOL GOVERNORlibtech_564_footnote,"
  
 [PRETORIA,
 After March 11, 1909]
 Your Petitioner is a British Indian, undergoing a sentence of three months’ imprisonment with hard labour.
 Your Petitioner received last week, as has been discovered, by mistake, one ounce of ghee every day with the rice that was issued to him for supper. Your Petitioner was admitted to this gaol on the 3rd instant.
 Since last Sunday, the issue of ghee for supper as above has been stopped. Your Petitioner tried to take the rice without ghee on Sunday last but found it difficult.
 Since Monday last, your Petitioner has had no supper at all, he having been obliged to return the rice issued to him.
 Your Petitioner complained of the absence of ghee to the Chief Warder, who referred your Petitioner to the regulations and suggested that your Petitioner could see the Medical Officer if he so wished.
 On the 11th instant, your Petitioner saw the Medical Officer who as a special concession was prepared to order a ration of bread for supper.
 Your Petitioner, while appreciating the concession, has been unable to avail himself of it, not being desirous of receiving any special concession in regard to diet as apart from his Indian fellow- prisoners placed under similar circumstances.
 Your Petitioner was shown the printed diet-scale which provides for one ounce of fat with rice as supper for Indian prisoners. The scale provides under Indian diet meat twice a week.
 Your Petitioner has been informed that this scale has been changed and Indian prisoners now receive one [ounce] of rice without
 
 fat for supper and rice with one ounce of ghee in lieu of meat for dinner on meat-days.
 Your Petitioner in common with the majority of Indians is prohibited by religion from taking meat or mutton fat or such other fat. Indian Mahomedans cannot take meat or fat not religiously killed. Indian Hindus with certain exceptions cannot at all take meat or fat.
 In the humble opinion of your Petitioner, the change above referred to is a change for the worse. It is most difficult to take rice without some adjunct. Moreover, the scale is deficient in nutrition with only two ounces of ghee per week.
 Your Petitioner has noticed that Natives receive one ounce of fat per day in addition to meat twice a week or at least once a week.
 In the humble opinion of your Petitioner, reversion to the old scale with the substitution of ghee for fat and  substitution  of vegetables for meat on meat-days will meet the ends of justice.
 If the above prayer is considered unreasonable, your Petitioner fears that he will suffer in health for want of sufficient nutrition.
 Your Petitioner ventures to draw your attention to the fact that the change prayed for is in accordance with the scale at the Johannesburg gaol.
 If the Governor is (not)libtech_565_footnoteempowered in law to grant the petition, your Petitioner requests that the petition may be forwarded to the Director of Prisons for consideration.
And for this act, etc.

         MY 	DEAR SON,  PRETORIA 	PRISON,  TRANSVAAL,  March 	25, 1909 
  	I have a right to write one letter per month and receive also one 	letter per month. It became a question with me as to whom I should 	write to . I thought of Mr. Ritch, Mr. Polak and you. I chose you, 	as you have been nearest my thoughts in all my reading.  	As for myself I must not, I am not allowed to, say much. I am quite 	at peace and none need worry about me.  	I hope mother is now quite well. I know several letters from you 	have been received but they have not been given to me. The Deputy 	Governor however was good enough to tell me that she was getting on 	well. Does she now walk about freely? I hope she and all of you 	would continue to take sago and milk in the morning.  	And how is Chanchilibtech_566_footnotelibtech_567_footnote? Tell her I think of her everyday. I hope she has got 	rid of all the sores she had and that she and Rami are quite well. I 	was much struck by one passage in Nathuramji’slibtech_568_footnotelibtech_569_footnoteintroduction 	to the Upanishads. He says that the Brahmacharya 	stage—i.e., the first stage—is like the last, i.e., the 	Sanyasin stage. This is true. Amusement only continues during 	the age of innocence, i.e., up to twelve years only. As soon as a 	boy reaches the age of discretion, he is taught to realise his 	responsibility. Every boy from such age onward should practise 	continence in thought and deed, truth likewise and the not taking of 	any life.

If you practise the three virtueslibtech_572_footnotelibtech_573_footnote, if they become       
 part of your life, so far as I am concerned, you will have completed your education—your training. Armed with them, believe me, you will earn your bread in any part of the world and you will have paved the way to acquire a true knowledge of the soul, yourself and God. This does not mean that you should not receive instruction in letters. That you should and you are doing. But it is a thing over which you need not fret yourself. You have plenty of time for it and after all you are to receive such instruction in order that your training may be of use to the others.
 Remember please that henceforth our lot is poverty. The more I think of it, the more I feel that it is more blessed to be poor than to be rich. The uses of poverty are far sweeter than those of riches.
 You have taken the sacred thread. I want you to live up to it. It appears that leaving one’s bed before sunrise is almost indispensable for proper worship. Do therefore try to keep regular hours. I have thought much over it and read something also. I respectfully disagree with the Swamiji in his propaganda. I think that the adoption of the sacred thread by those who have for ages given it up is a mistake. As it is, we have too much of the false division between shudras and others. The sacred thread is therefore today rather a hindrance than a help. I should like to elaborate this veiw but I cannot for the present. I am aware that I am expressing these views before one who has made a lifelong study of the subject. Yet I thought that I would pass on to the Swamiji what I have been thinking over. I have studied the Gayatrilibtech_574_footnotelibtech_575_footnote. I like the words. I have also studied the book the Swamiji gave me. I have derived much benefit from its perusal. It makes me more inquisitive about the life of Swami Dayanandlibtech_576_footnotelibtech_577_footnote. I see that the meaning given by Swami Dayanand to the Gayatri and several mantras of the Vajasaneya Upanishad is totally different from that given by the orthodox school—now which meaning is correct? I do not know. I hesitate straightway to accept the revolutionary method of interpretation suggested by S. Dayanand. I would much like to learn all this through the Swamiji’s lips.I hope he will not leave before I am out, but if he does leave, will he kindly leave all the literature he can or send it from India? I should also like to know what the orthodox school has said about S. Dayanand’s teaching. Please thank the Swamiji for the handmade socks and gloves he has sent me. And get
 
 his address in India. Show the whole of this letter to the Swamiji and let me know what he says.
 I have not yet thanked Bhatt Keshavram for presenting me with the Upanishad. The book has been simply invaluable. It has given me much solace. Write to him thanking him on my behalf and tell him what I have said above.
 How is the school progressing? Have any other boys come? How   are   Ebrahimlibtech_578_footnoteand   Manikamlibtech_579_footnote?   If    the   building    is    being constructed, Chhaganbhailibtech_580_footnoteshould see to it that four tanks are put at the four corners. Mr. Ismail Gora should be approached regarding it.
 How is Mr. Cordes? Tell him I have not forgotten the scene enacted at Mr. Kallenbach’s the day I left for Volksrust. I often think of him, sit and say to myself, “After all, how egotistical we all are!”
 Mrs. West by this time must be out of the woods. Let me know how she, Mrs. Pywelllibtech_581_footnoteand Devibehnlibtech_582_footnoteare keeping. I trust Mrs. Pywell continues to act the mother of the settlement.
Has Thakarlibtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnotearrived? If he has, where is he housed? How is he?
How is his wife?
 I   hope   Kababhai’slibtech_585_footnotelibtech_586_footnoteson   is   quite  all  rightlibtech_587_footnotelibtech_588_footnotenow   and  that Dhoribhailibtech_589_footnotelibtech_590_footnoteand Nagarlibtech_591_footnotelibtech_592_footnotelibtech_593_footnoteare now fixed up.
 Let Mr. Polak please keep his eye on the finances of the office. Dada Abdulla & Co. should be approached and asked to pay a portion of the debt they owe. Mr. McIntyrelibtech_594_footnotelibtech_595_footnote, I hope, is looking after the business part of the office. What about Miss Schlesin’s articles? I am entitled to receive one visitor during a month. Let Mr. Polak  come. He has not yet sent the books I have asked for.
 I received Purshotamdas’libtech_596_footnoteletter. But I was not able to reply to it. He should have the verandah fenced. The other additions should, I

 think, for the present, stay over unless they are absolutely required. I hope, tell him, he has well digested the conversation I had with him. He has raised in me great expectations to which he has to live up. How is poor Anilibtech_597_footnotelibtech_598_footnote? She must be loaded with work !
 Please let me know how Messrs Sam, Behary, Muthu Rajcoomar, Ram and Mannering are getting on?libtech_599_footnoteRemember me to them. I hope Mr. Mannering has not again got tired of the jungle life.
 Remember me to Mr. West and ask him to recall the communion I had with him on the day of departure from Phoenix.
 And now again, yourself. Do give ample work to gardening, actual digging, hoeing, etc. We have to live upon it in future. And you should be the expert gardener of the family. Keep your tools in their respective places and absolutely clean. I hape Ramdas and Devdas are keeping well, learning their lessons and not causing any worry. Has Ramdas got rid of his cough?
 I trust you all treated Willie well while he was with us. Any balance of the foodstuff left by Mr. Cordes, I doubt not you have returned to him.
 And now about yourself. How are you. Although I think that you are well able to bear all the burden I have placed on your shoulders and that you are doing it quite cheerfully, I have often felt that you required greater personal guidance that I have been able to give you. I know too that you have sometimes felt that your education was being neglected. Now I have read a great deal in the prison. I have been reading Emerson, Ruskin and Mazzini. I have also been reading the Upanishads. All confirm the view that education does not mean a knowledge of letters but it means character building, it means a knowledge of duty. Our own word literally means ‘training’. If this be the true view and it is to my mind the only true view, you are receiving the best education—training—possible. What can be better than that you should have the opportunity of nursing mother and cheerfully bearing her ill temper, or than looking after Chanchi and anticipating her wants and behaving to her so as not to make her feel the want of Harilal or, again, than being guardian to Ramdas and Devdas? If you succeed in doing this well, you have received more than half your education. In your lessons you should give a great deal of attention to mathematics and Sanskrit. The latter is absolutely
 
 
 necessary for you. Both these studies are difficult in after life. You will not neglect your music. You should make a selection of all the good passages, hymns and verses, whether in English, Gujarati or  Hindi and write them out in your best hand in a book. The collection at the end of a year will be most valuable. All these things you can do easily it you are methodical, never get agitated and think you have too much to do and then worry over what to do first. This you will find out in practice if you are patient and take care of your minutes. I hope you are keeping an accu-rate account, as it should be kept, of every penny spent for the household.
 Remind Anandlalbhai of his promise this time not to dis- continue his studies. I am more anxious that he should give a proper training to Vijialibtech_600_footnotelibtech_601_footnote. Has he secured the garden?
 Please tell Maganlalbhai that I would advise him to read Emerson’s essays. They can be had for nine pence in Durban. There is a cheap reprint out. Those essays are worth studying. He should read them, mark the important passages and then finally copy them out in a notebook. The essays to my mind contain the teaching of Indian wisdom in a Western garb. It is refreshing to see our own sometimes thus differently fashioned. He should also try to read Tolstoy’s Kingdom of God Is within You. It is a most logical book. The English of the translation is very simple.What is more, Tolstoy practises what he preaches.
 I hope the evening service continues and that you and all attend the Sunday service at Mr. West’s.
 You should copy this letter. Get the others to assist you and send a copy of it to Mr. Polak and a copy to Mr.Kallenbach, another to Swamiji. You should read my letter carefully and give me a detailed reply. You should wait for a reply from Mr. Polak so that you may tell me what he has to say. As soon as you have read and understood my letter, you may commence writing your reply. It should be [in] ink and neat. Let it be as long as you want to make it. It should not contain any information about the struggle. Then there would be no difficulty about my getting it. You may take your time about the reply. This will be in your hands perhaps on Tuesday. I shall wait a week from that date. You may even take longer if you like. You should await Swamiji’s and Mr. Kallenbach’s letters also before
 
 closing your letter. You may tell me what they have to say. You may write a little from day to day. What you cannot express in English, you should get Purshotamdas to translate for you. It you do not understand any portion of this letter, you should get it translated to you.
Please send me a copy of Algebra. Any edition will do.
 And now I close with love to all and kisses to Ramdas, Devdas and Rami.

 [PRETORIA GAOL,
 Before April 10, 1909] I have seen your letter addressed to the British Indian Association regarding its evidence to be submitted to the Commission.
I have not been able, my movement[s] having been uncertain, to
 submit my statement earlier. Nor has it been possible to call a meeting of the Association to consider the evidence to be given. The Chairmanlibtech_605_footnoteand the Acting Chairmanlibtech_606_footnoteof the Association are in gaol. The statement, therefore, that I am about to submit represents my personal views only.
 I have been in South Africa now for the last fifteen years, and having, almost throughout that period, been officially connected with Indian public bodies, I have come in contact with all  classes  of Indians. Since 1903, I have been practising as an attorney in Johannesburg, and have held the office of Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association.
 The Transvaal has a population of not more than 13,000 adult male Indians. Indians actually resident in the Colony since the war have probably never been more than 10,000 at any time. At  the present moment, owing to the Asiatic struggle, there are probably not more than 5,000 in the Colony. These are chiefly Mahomedans and Hindoos. For the purposes hereof, I do not consider the Christians and the Parsees, as they form, though an important, a numerically small section of the Indian community.
 Both Mahomedans and Hindoos are prohibited by their respective religions from taking intoxicating liquors. The Mahomedan section has very largely conformed to the prohibition. The Hindoo section, I am sorry to say, contains an appreciable number who, in this Colony, have disregarded the prohibition of religion.
The method adopted by Indians who indulge in alcoholic drinks
 
 is generally to secure the assistance of some unscrupulous whites. There are other methods, also, which I do not care to go into.
 I am of opinion that the legal prohibition should continue. I think, however, that the prohibition has not succeeded in preventing Indians, who have wanted it, from obtaining liquor. The only use I see in continuing the prohibition is to let those of my countrymen, who indulge in it, retain the sense of shame they have in drinking liquor. They know that it is wrong for them both in religion and in law to obtain and drink liquor. This enables temperance workers to appeal to their law-abiding sentiment. I draw a fundamental distinction between wrongful law-breaking and a conscientious breach of man-made law in obedience to a higher law. Happily, those Indians who break the liquor law know that it is wrong for them to do so.
 I am aware that some of my countrymen—themselves ardent temperance men—see in the liquor legislation one more disqualification based on the ground  of colour. Superficially speaking, they would be right. But I believe that this legislation has little to do with colour. It is, in my opinion, a recognition on the part of the predominant race that the drink habit is an evil which, while they themselves are yet unable to get rid of, they do not want other races to contract. Viewing the position in this manner, I believe liquor prohibition among the Asiatic and Coloured races  to  be  the forerunner of general prohibition.
 Whether, however, general prohibition becomes an accomplished fact or not, so long as the predominant race continue to indulge in alcoholic drinks, be it ever so moderately,  partial prohibition such as we now have cannot be of much practical use. This, it is submitted, is a forcible illustration of one of the  evil incidents of contact between the European and other  races.  And unless those who preach abstinence are themselves ready to practise it, all liquor legislation must largely be a makeshift. I wish the Commission could see their way to point out to the electors of the Transvaal what a serious responsibility rests on their shoulders. They make it impossible for their representatives to pass legislation that is so desirable. It is they who must take the responsibility for the breaking up of many a home. I am writing under a full sense of my own responsibility. I know only too well how many Indian youths who never knew the taste of spirituous liquors have  succumbed,  after having come to South Africa or the Transvaal.
 If the Commission desire me to answer any question, I shall be pleased to do so.

203,"April 	26, 1909",LETTER TO H. S. L. POLAKlibtech_607_footnote,"
           FROM     PRETORIA [GAOL,]  April 	26, 1909 
 MR. 	GANDHI 	(CONVICT 	NO. 	777) MY 	DEAR HENRY,  	Nothing has caused me so much worry as the financial question. I 	hate the idea of Phoenix being in debt; that is what the office 	debts mean. Besides the jewellery, then some of the law-books, i.e., 	the books I got out from England and the law-reports should  be 	sacrificed, also the large safe in the office and the cyclopaedia in 	the revolving case. The law books may be placed before Playford, 	Benson, or Godfrey, if he is doing well. If none of them can take 	any or all up, you may circulate a list. They should go at cost 	price less 10 per cent. The safe should fetch at least £ 15. 	Godfrey owes £ 3 for the cyclopaedia (Curtis’s). You know Curtis 	got £3 from me. This amount does not appear in the books. It might 	now be collected.  	I had a long letter from Manilal, not badly constructed. I see that 	Mrs. Pywell is proud of her grand-daughter and considers her to be 	the …libtech_608_footnotebe 	careful. Waldolibtech_609_footnote, 	who may be claimed to be a Phoenixite in posse, is the 	pattern to be beaten. It is a hard feat. I should like to know how 	Cordes’ lecture went off, and where it was given. Has Thakar 	brought any books and type from Bombay? I notice that the Thakars 	are staying with Chhaganlal. Now Chhaganlal Like Millielibtech_610_footnotehas a habit of suffering mutely. But the suffering 	tells on both of them. They, therefore, make the friends’ position 	embarrassing. I am, therefore, anxious that Chhaganlal should not 	overdo things. He is a man … as his mother puts it, of being baked 	even under the s[hade of a] leafy tree. I have found this trait in 	him ever [since I have] known       
 him as a grown-up boy. And I have seen no [reason to change] my opinion. Please, therefore, tell him that he must not tax himself. I do not know Mrs. Gandhi’s intentions. [The Thakars] should have stayed with her. Purshotamdas and Cordes [have each] a boarder now. It is grand of Cordes to [take a boarder.] It is so like him. But I am sceptical about the advisability of P[urshottamdas] having taken up any boarder at all. He has hardly enough floor space. Ani has more than enough having to look after four kids. P[urshottamdas] wishes to do her reparation for past laches. He has not begun well in that direction. I should, therefore, very much like to know what he has done to lighten his poor wife’s burdens. The message he has sent me is sweet. More I will not say at present. I should like all in Phoenix to read Tolstoy’s Life and My Confessions. Both are soul-stirring books. They can be easily read in two days. The Gujaratis should also read Kavi’s two volumes—the books I have got. Thakar may have brought them. They may give 10 minutes of the half-hour evening service and half hour of the hour’s service on Sundays, which the Gujaratis have [for] themselves. The more I consider his life and his writings, the more I consider him to have been the best Indian of his times. Indeed,  I put him much higher than Tolstoy in religious perception.  The books I have read have afforded me the highest solace. They should be read over and over again. So far as English books are concerned, Tolstoy is incomparable in my opinion in chastity of thought. His definition of the purpose of life is unanswerable and easy to understand. Both Kavi and Tolstoy have lived as they have preached. Kavi writes from richer experience. Will you ask Chhaganlal to write Revashanker Jagjiwan & Co. to let me know what I owe them and what they advance monthly to my sisterlibtech_611_footnotelibtech_612_footnote? Manilal is naturally somewhat dissatisfied with his studies. But it is inevitable. We are in the experimental stage and the first students have to be the victims. However, let him learn well what is given to him. I hope one of these days to examine him. He was sure of his geometry lessons, but he was found wanting. Let him cultivate regular and studious habits, and  learn to rely on himself in his studies. One of these days I may be able to undertake part of his tuition myself. [I] understand too his worry about gardening. He should be patient[, give the] best that is in him and then remain perfectly cheerful [without] anxiety or fretting. I wish the boys would talk [to Mani]kum in Tamil. I am glad Kitchin
 
 was at Phoenix for a day. Manilal does not mention whether he was pleased with his stay there. I hope everything was done to make him comfortable there. I suggest to Maganlal that now that he has learnt so many English pieces by heart he should commit to memory some Tamil sentences. Is Chanchi cheerful? Or does she brood over her separation from Harilal? Does Mrs. G[andhi] now take part in household  work?  Pray   thank   Dr.   Nanjilibtech_613_footnotefor   his   attention   to   the Phoenix settlers. He is ever adding to the debt I am under to him. What is the progress of the school-building? I think Chhaganlal should represent to Mr. Gora on my behalf that he should consent to the boarding allowance to be raised so as to free the guardians from eternal worry about half-pennies. I am glad Swamiji is prolonging his stay. I hope to learn more from him about the sacred thread on meeting.   I   hope   he   received   my   letterlibtech_614_footnotelibtech_615_footnoteaddressed   to   him   at Pietermaritzburg, from the train. I am anxious that he should do everything he can to promote the goodwill existing between Hindus and Mahomedans. I expect Anandlal to keep to his promise not to abandon his studies and to make the garden smile. Please ask West to continue the Sunday services in spite of difficulties, if any. During Mrs. West’s illness, they may be held elsewhere but so far as possible should not be omitted. Will you please have the Phoenix part copied and sent to West? Then all can read it, and let Chhaganlal give me a detailed reply embodying messages from all who have any to send. I would expect a letter from Chhaganlal at the latest on the 7th May. That would give him ample time.libtech_616_footnote

 [PRETORIA,
 May 24, 1909]
 I have no time to make a long speech. Having gone for  breakfast, I was [as it were] locked up for some time. However, I will say a few words which I hope you will bear in mind. I can say from my experience of gaol that conditions of gaol life are satisfactory. We are bound to get what we have been asking for. I find on my release that those who are brave will stand firm. The Chairman said that this fight was being prolonged on account of disunity among us. But I do not think this is true. It is because our people have been cowed down that they do not fill the gaols. Those who are fearless do go to gaol, and will continue to do so. That is as it should be. Prisoners who have been released appear to be ready to go to gaol again at a moment’s notice, notwithstanding the hardships that they have suffered there. He who has tasted the sweetness of gaol life will never shrink from it, but will welcome going there every time.
 The Chief Warder told me at the time of my release that it was useless to advise me not to return to gaol, for he knew that I would not accept the advice. This shows what impression satyagraha has made on his mind. I find no happiness outside gaol. While in gaol, I could devote myself regularly to prayers. Now that I am out of it, I shall have no time for them. A lamp was lit at half past five in the morning in order to wake up the prisoners and enable them to roll up their beds and be ready, and it was put out after half an hour. In the darkness which followed, some prisoners engaged themselves in small talk, while I found it a good opportunity to pray to God. From tomorrow, I shall not get such opportunity and facility. Whatever you may think, I certainly do not subscribe to the view that life is difficult in gaol and happy outside. Those who are afraid of gaol have registered themselves, or are doing so. However, there is a duty that they also can perform. There can be no one who is opposed to us in the path of truth that we have been following, and if there is any such

 man, he does not deserve to be called an Indian, but should rather be regarded as working for India’s utter ruin. It was good that I had an opportunity for a talk with Mr. Hajee Cassim. If you ask him, he will tell you what should now be done and, if you act accordingly, that will be as good as helping the cause. I am not happy at being released; rather, I am unhappy. Mr. Vyas gave me sweetmeats for breakfast, but they were as bitter to me as poison. For, Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Rustomjee, Mr. Joshi and others, including, if I may be personal, my eldest son Harilal, are still in gaol, and they have more then two and a half months yet to serve. I would feel happy only if I were imprisoned [again] and released after them. I cannot say now how this can be brought about. As for me, all my pleasures and my happiness are in gaol. If we think of our pledge, going to gaol appears to be the only desirable course. I will try my best to see that I am imprisoned again and released after those others. But I cannot have my way as to how long I shall be in gaol. What I have to tell you or rather the request I have to make to you is this, that those who have the courage must go to-gaol. Others who cannot do so will do what I have advised Mr. Hajee Cassim to do. While in gaol, I learnt from Mr. Polak’s letter that the British Indian Association has become bankrupt and the people have been financially ruined. Therefore, those who  have  been carrying on their businesses must lighten their pockets. I have heard that this is being done, but I do not think on an adequate scale. Please give more generously. Your generosity will be justified; it will also please God. I thank you for having assembled in such large numbers and I request you again to fill the gaols and not rest till our demands are conceded. You too can see for yourselves that there is no other course that I can advise. I am sure you agree with me.libtech_618_footnote

 …He said that he had been released from gaol, but he felt no pleasure at that, many of the stalwarts among his compatriots had still to serve their sentences, and his own son had six months to do, but for all that, the struggle must go on until the Government granted them relief to which they were entitled; their sufferings must continue until justice was done. Those Indians who could not bear the hardships of gaol should give what assistance they could in other ways, for he took it that no single Indian could possibly approve of the harsh measures of the Government or fail in sympathy of one sort or another with the struggle which was now proceeding. There could only be one end to the struggle, and that end would be hastened or delayed by the strength displayed by the British Indian community. They were now in the hottest part of the fight, and it was possible that they might not carry all their countrymen with them, but that only meant that the brunt of the battle would fall on the shoulders of the few, but, concluded Mr. Gandhi:
whether our members be large or small, I earnestly pray God
 that He will give us strength to carry the burden until we have reached the goal.

 …Mr. Gandhi said that he had no desire at the present moment to make any statement in regard to his treatment in gaol; he had now done five months and three weeks, having served three sentences.
 In regard to the deportation policy, Mr. Gandhi said that he would have to go into the matter carefully. He could not see how it was possible for the Transvaal Government to retain authority over British Indians long enough to deport them to India. In any case, the policy of deportation, he said, was a very foolish one, it was unnecessarily cruel and would merely transfer the struggle to a country where it might

 It cuts me to the quick, to hear of a lad  of sixteen  being deported to India, while his father remained in gaol at Volksrust. The Government are very much mistaken if they imagine that they will break the heart of the Indians by resorting to such cruel methods.libtech_621_footnote

 After so many months I have this opportunity to see you and to be with you. I am glad of it. But I am not happy at my release, for our leaders, and aged ones at that, are still in gaol. They have still more than two months to put in to complete their term of imprisonment. Among them, as you know, are Dawad Sheth, Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, Mr. Sorabji and others. Speaking of what touches me personally, I may say that my son Harilal is also in gaol. How can I then feel at ease? So long as we do not get what we want, we cannot feel happy at heart. God will grant what we have been demanding. But it is through the Government that we shall receive it. Why we do not get what we want has been explained by Mr. Cachalia. A task that  needs  a  thousand men cannot be accomplished by ten, as it were. The struggle is being prolonged because not enough men join it. We  at  this moment are in the House of the Lord, where we took pledges on oath, raised our hands and declared that we would continue to fight till the law was repealed and the rights of the educated were conceded, and that we would not avail ourselves of the certificates [of registration]. We must go to gaol to carry out this pledge. I for one should very much like to run up to Natal and, returning, get arrested. That way I can join Dawad Sheth in gaol. My duty is to serve the community and its well-wishers. The right way of doing so for me is to join Dawad
 
 
 Sheth in gaol. I was heralded today with the cry: “Salute the King of Hindus and Muslims.” That was not right. I am a servant of the community, not its king. I pray to God to grant me the strength and the desire always to serve the community. My aspiration will be fulfilled only if I have to lay down my life in the very act of serving the community.libtech_623_footnotelibtech_624_footnoteIt is indeed my duty so to die. Those who have love for India and Indians must necessarily make themselves servants of the community. I did not, and do not, deserve the honour of a coach. I have not been able to serve as well as I ought to have done. For, there are others who are still in gaol as servants of the community. They return to it again and again, when they are released. The Chairman became a servant after sacrificing everything, and is still serving. My mind would be at ease only if I had  to  suffer imprisonment as others have to, and were released after they are released. Tomorrow, Mr. Omarji Sale, Chairman of the Hamidia Islamic Society, will be released. Mr. Vyas and Mr. David Ernest will be released from Diepkloof. Indians must go to receive them. I hope that Kanamias will show their highest spirit this time, and pull Mr. Omarji Sale’s carriage. I am sure the old gentleman will prefer to court imprisonment yet again for the sake of the community. I pray for God’s blessings on him so that he may be full of strength despite his old age. It is also the duty of others to act like him. People must take a carriage even to Diepkloof and bring [them] in it. I do not wish to say more for the present. If any Indian talks of defeat, that will mean that he himself is defeated. If a person going to gaol is firm in his resolve, he is ever victorious. It lies in God’s hands as to when the obnoxious Act will be repealed and men of education allowed their rights; however, it is our faith in Him and the way we act that will determine the course of future events. God is with those who follow the right. Since we follow the right, victory is bound to be ours. When  I arrived at Volksrust after two months’ imprisonment, there was the same number of men present, as there is today. I should like to ask you whether you just come to say “yes” to everything I say, or want to join in shouldering the burden. Your duty is to bear the hardships of gaol life. Please bear that in mind. It is the same whether one is in gaol or outside. There were some Tamils with me in Volksrust [Gaol]. Mr. Naidoo writes to say that they remain unbending, and are ready to go to gaol at a moment’s notice. We have a paper of our own, so that
 
 we are able to carry on propaganda. There is no paper in the language of the Tamils, and yet what courage they have been displaying, and how well they have been doing their duty! They have faith in God. We ought to learn a lesson from them and follow in their footsteps. If we do, victory will be ours quite soon. I thank you all, and the Chinese as well, for having taken the trouble to come here to receive me. I am not in a position to say anything more at the moment without studying the community’s mood. However, if you have any question to ask, I shall answer them at the office. We have had enough of taking of pledges and raising of hands. I do not want to have these things repeated. But it you are prepared unreservedly to go to gaol, all the ways are open to you. I shall, in that case, give the best advice I can. If you go to gaol, you will be assured of victory. There is still time. It will be enough if you do just this.libtech_625_footnote

 "
208,"May 24, 1909",SPEECH AT JOHANNESBURG MEETING,"
  
 [JOHANNESBURG,
 May 24, 1909]
 He [Gandhiji] said it was not with any degree of pleasure that he came out of gaol. The reason was obvious. Some of the best men in the Indian community were still in one or other of the Transvaal gaols, and some of them were elderly men. His own eldest son was also still in gaol. Some of them had still two to two-and-a-half months to do. Some of them had worked with him as friends, and some had gone to gaol simply out of love and regard for him. Could he, as a human being, derive any pleasure from his freedom when all those men had a restraint placed on their liberty? He could not be happy under such circumstances. So long as justice, which was their due, had not been done to them, they could not take food and rest. When that justice was to come, God only knew, but that it was bound to come they did know. He had considered and reconsidered the position during the past three memorable months, and, after looking over the past two-and-a-half years, he was still able to say that he withdrew nothing of the advice that he had given to his countrymen. (Applause.) He could not withdraw a single word of his condemnation of the Law of 1907, and he still adhered to his statement that General Smuts was bound by his promise to repeal the Act. They wanted absolute and pure justice. No Indian could sit still under the insult offered to the whole Indian nation. As long as the present state of affairs lasted, the
 
 only place of safety in the Transvaal was the gaol. He did not wish to say much about his treatment in gaol or about the struggle; in the latter case because he knew little of what had been going on of late. He had nothing to say against the prison officials who were in immediate charge of him. The section warders treated him with every courtesy and kindness, and so did the other officials. He would shortly put in writing a great deal more that he had to say to his countrymen. There was plenty of work for them to do, and they must realise their duty. He preferred to see them work for the cause to being dragged through the streets in a carriage. During the last three months, he had found much consolation in reading the book of the prophet Daniel in the Bible. Daniel was one of the greatest passive resisters that ever lived, and they must follow his example. The laws of Generals Botha and Smuts were not for them (Indians) if they were in conflict with their consciences. They must sit with their doors flung wide open and tell those gentlemen that whatever laws they passed were not for them unless those laws were from God. Let them be up and doing, and not waste words or energy. He regretted that some of them had broken their solemn oaths by accepting the law, but they could still recall their act and do the right thing. He informed the meeting that several prominent Indians would be released tomorrow, and he asked them to give them a fitting reception. He thanked them heartily for their
 presence, and he asked God to give them strength to carry out the real work that lay before them.libtech_626_footnote

209,"May 26, 1909",LETTER TO THE PRESSlibtech_627_footnote,"
  
 JOHANNESBURG,
 May 26, 1909
 
 SIR,   As there has been 	much talk, during my last incarceration, 
  	regarding the treatment I underwent, I shall thank you to publish 	the following statement. When I was sentenced to undergo 	imprisonment for three months with hard labour at Volksrust, and 	taken to the gaol there, I found myself in the company of over fifty 	fellow-workers, including my son. This, in itself, was to me a great 	pleasure. The food supplied was nice and clean, and included 1 oz. 	of ghee (clarified butter) per day, and was cooked by Indian cooks. 	All Indian prisoners     Indian 	Opinion under the 	caption “Mr. Gandhi’s Experiences in the Pretoria Gaol”. 
 were completely separated from the Natives, and had separate sanitary accommodation also. Those who occupied cells had bed-boards, in addition to the usual supply of blankets, etc., and all had a pillow each issued to them. The work was out-door work, and consisted for about thirty of us in road-repair or weed-ing the school ground, either of which, so far as I was concerned, was very agreeable and healthy, I was sentenced on the 25th February last.
 “ ISOLATED”
 On the 2nd March, I was ordered to be removed to Pretoria. I had to travel in a third-class compartment, and, as most of the  travelling was done during the night, it was naturally cold, more so as no blankets are issued, evidently, to prisoners. Arriving at Pretoria on the 3rd March, I was, after the usual formalities had been  gone through, locked up in a cell. For, I think, five days, I had to pass the whole of the time in the cell or the corridor, except when I was  allowed out for bathing and for such other purposes. My cell-door was marked “isolated” and I found, too, that I was isolated along with four other prisoners, one of whom was convicted of having made an attempt to murder, two of having committed sodomy, and one bestiality. Here there was no pillow and no bed-board issued, and, for food, there was no ghee allowed except on Wednesdays and Sundays. The work given to me consisted in polishing the floor of my own cell and polishing the cell-doors in the corridor of the section in which I was accommodated, along with the Native prisoners. It was during this time that Mr. Lichtensteinlibtech_628_footnotevisited me, and I told him that I considered the treatment to be brutal, and that there was evidently an intention on the part of General Smuts to bend me, but that I was not likely to succumb. Subsequently, I was given half-hour’s exercise twice a day, and the work was altered to that of blanket-quilting, or such other tailoring work.
 ONE MEAL PER DAY
 I went practically without any breakfast, because the mealie- meal was not cooked sufficiently for my taste. I made no complaint about it, as all the other prisoners, I noticed, took their porridge with relish. I went without supper, because the rice issued contained no ghee. I complained about the absence of ghee to the Chief Warder,
 
 but he pleaded helplessness, because the regulations did not provide for the issue of ghee to Indian prisoners. I may state, parenthetically, that 1 oz. of fat per day is given to all Native prisoners. I then approached the medical officer and submitted that the Indian diet- scale should include 1 oz. of ghee per day. He would not make the change, but, for me specially, ordered 8 oz . of bread, along with the rice. I told him that, while I appreciated it, I could not accept a special privilege, unless ghee was issued to all Indian prisoners, as I considered it to be absolutely necessary for their health. I then approached the Director of Prisons in the matter.libtech_629_footnotelibtech_630_footnoteA fortnight after, an order was made that I was to have 1 oz. of ghee allowed with my rice.  I took this for a day, believing that the order was generally applicable. When, however, I found that it was a concession only for me, I was obliged to revert to the original position, that is, one meal per day. I again drew the attention of the Director of Prisons to the fact that I was being partially starved, and a reply came, after I had served for a month and a half, that ghee would be issued, pending an alteration of the Indian diet-scale, wherever there was a body of Indian prisoners. I felt thankful for this, and had no hesitation thereafter in taking my supper. After this, absence of breakfast was no loss to me.
 HEALTH IMPAIRED
 The Director of Prisons paid a visit , and made kind inquiries about myself, and, when he asked me whether I had any complaints, I pointed to some of the facts I have already narrated; and a bed-board, felt-mattress, night-shirt and handkerchief were issued to me, and I was allowed the use of pencil and note-book, which had been hitherto denied to me. I would also mention here gratefully that I was allowed an unrestricted use of books, which to me were a source of the greatest consolation. The tailoring work in my cell, which required bending to it for nearly seven hours per day, began to tell upon my health. I, therefore, requested that I should have more active work, or, at least, that I should be allowed to do the tailoring in the open. Both the requests were at first rejected. I suffered, I believe, owing to this close confinement in the cell, from violent neuralgia for nearly ten days, and I developed symptoms, too,of chest disease. On repeating my request, I was allowed to do the tailoring work in the open air.
 
 
  
 GOVERNMENT ALONE TO BLAME
 The opinion I expressed to Mr. Lichtenstein about  General Smuts underwent a change upon further observation, and I felt that he had directly nothing to do with the treatment described above. Indeed, I gratefully recall here the sending by him of two nice books for me to read, testifying, as I took it, to the fact that he entertained no personal ill will against me, and that he gave me credit for doing what  I believed to be right. Nor do I blame any of the officials for what I had to undergo. They were all courteous and kind, and I cannot be sufficiently thankful to the section warders, who seemed to realise the peculiar position in which I was placed, and showed me every consideration. And yet I must adhere to the opinion that the treatment itself was brutal. My sentence was imprisonment with hard labour, but, for the larger part of the term, it was practically solitary confinement. The officials of the Prison Department could do no otherwise bacause, Indians being classed with Native prisoners, I could only be placed in the Native section. The same, however, can hardly be said of the Government, who, having so many Indian prisoners on hand, gave no thought to the matter. They must have known, when I was cruelly separated from my fellow-prisoners at Volksrust, that, at Pretoria, I would be obliged to undergo hardships not warranted by the sentence imposed upon me. I do not say that Indian prisoners  should  be classed with Europeans. Their lot would, then, probably, be much worse than it is now. But I do say that they should be separately classed and separately accommodated. I may be told that, having invited imprisonment for myself, I can hardly complain of the prison system with any justification. This taunt is inapplicable, because, I submit, avoidable misery was inflicted upon me, and, in any case, it is as well for the public, in whose name the Government is supposed to be acting, to know what is being done to Indian passive resisters.
 OTHER PRISONERS
 After my discharge I learnt that, if I fared somewhat ill, the majori-ty of the other passive resisters fared no better, if not worse; for the majo-rity of the Indian passive resisters at the Johannesburg Fort were removed to the penal settlement at Diepkloof, and the majority of those at Volksrust to Heidelberg, at both of which places, in the initial stages, they had to undergo hardships for which there was no
 warrant. The Indian prisoner may not complain about the labour to which he is put so long as it is tolerable, but I think that he has every right to complain about improper, unsuitable, or insufficient diet. It is hardly any credit to the Colony that one of the bravest and the truest of Indians in the Colony, an Indian who has occupied the position of Acting Chairman of the British Indian Association, and who is a well- know merchant, has been made to carry slop-pails.
 No amount of harassing that may be applied will turn those who have passed through their experience during the last few months from their purpose. Several have already again been imprisoned, one young man of nineteen for the fifth time. The public has no knowledge of the fact that an Indian is nearly every day arrested and imprisoned for three months with hard labour, at Vereeniging, for managing the store belonging to Mr. Aswat, who is himself locked up at Diepkloof. Eight such Indians have already been offered up as a sacrifice, and volunteers are still forthcoming to take charge of this store. Passive resistance is not then dead. It cannot die, because it represents truth.

 "
210,,WHO CAN OFFER SATYAGRAHA?,"
  
 The satyagraha campaign in the Transvaal has lasted so long and has been so conducted that we have been able to see—learn—a great many things from it. Many have had personal experience of it. This much at least has been realized by everyone—that, in a struggle of this kind, there is no room for defeat. If, on any occasion, we fail, we shall discover that the failure was due to some deficiency in the satyagrahi and did not argue the inefficacy of satyagraha as such. The point needs to be carefully grasped. No such rule can be applied to physical fighting. When two armies engage in such fighting, defeat [of either] will not necessarily be the result of the inferior fighting quality of the troops. The combatants may have a high morale, and yet, insufficiency in other matters may lead to defeat. For instance , one side may have better arms than the other, or may be favourably placed in the battle-field, or may command superior technical skill.There are many such extraneous factors which account for the victory or defeat of the parties to a physical fight. But such factors offer no difficulties to those fighting the battle of satyagraha. Their deficiency alone can come in their way. Moreover, in the usual kind of fighting, all the members of the losing side should be deemed to have been defeated,
 and in fact they do think that way. In satyagraha, the victory of a single member may be taken to mean the victory of all, but the defeat of the side as a whole does not spell defeat for the person who has not himself yielded. For instance, in the Transvaal fight, even if a majority of Indians were to submit to the obnoxious Act, he who remains unyielding will be victorious indeed, for the fact remains that he has not yielded.
 That being so, it is necessary to inquire as to who can offer so admirable a battle—one which admits of no defeat—which can have only one result. The inquiry will enable us to understand some of the results of the Transvaal campaign, and to decide how and by whom a campaign of this kind can be fought elsewhere or on some other occasion.
 If we inquire into the meaning of satyagraha, we find that the first condition is that anyone who wants to engage in this kind of fighting should show a special regard for truth—should have the strength that flows from truthfulness. That is to say, such a  man should depend on truth alone. One cannot have the best of both worlds.libtech_631_footnotelibtech_632_footnoteA man who attempts  to  have  it  so  will  be  crushed  under pressure of both kinds.libtech_633_footnoteSatyagraha is not a carrot, to be played on as a pipe.libtech_634_footnotelibtech_635_footnoteAnyone who thinks that it is, so that he may play on it if he can or bite it off if he cannot, will find himself lost in the end. It is absurd to suggest that satyagraha is being resorted to only by those who are deficient in physical strength or who, finding physical strength unavailing, can think of no alternative but satyagraha. Those who hold such a view, it may be said, do not know what this fight means. Satyagraha is more potent than physical strength, which is as worthless as straw when compared with the former. Essentially, physical strength means that a man of such strength fights on the battle-field with little regard for his body, that is to say, he knows no fear. A satyagrahi, on his part, gives no thought whatever to his body. Fear cannot touch him at all. That is why he does not arm himself with any material weapons, but continues resistance till the end without fear of death. This means that the satyagrahi should have more courage than the man who relies on physical strength. Thus, the first thing
 
 
 necessary for a satyagrahi is pursuit of truth, faith in truth.
 He must be indifferent to wealth. Wealth and truth have always been in conflict with each other, and will remain so till the end of time. We have found from many examples of Indians in the Transvaal that he who clings to wealth cannot be loyal to truth. This does not mean that a satyagrahi can have no wealth. He can, but he cannot make his wealth his God. Money is welcome if one can have it consistently with one’s pursuit of truth; otherwise one must not hesitate even for a mo-ment to sacrifice it as if it were no more than dirt on one’s hand. No one who has not cultivated such an attitude can practise satyagraha. Moreover, in a land where one is obliged to offer satyagraha against the rulers, it is not likely that the satyagrahi will be able to own wealth. The power of a king may be unavailing against an individual. But it can touch his pro-perty, or play on his fear of losing it. The king bends the subjects to his will by threatening them with loss of property or physical harm. There-fore, under the rule of a tyrannical king, for the most part, it is only those who make themselves accomplices in his tyranny can retain or amass wealth. Since a satyagrahi cannot allow himself to be an accomplice  in tyranny, he must, in such circumstances, be content to think himself rich in his poverty. If he owns any wealth, he must hold it in some other country.
 A satyagrahi is obliged to break away from family attachments. This is very difficult to do. But the practice  of  satyagraha,  if satyagraha is to be worthy of its name, is like walking on the edge of a sword. In the long run, even the breaking away from family attachm- ents will prove beneficial to the family. For, the members  of  the family will come to feel the call for satyagraha, and those who have felt such a call will have no other desire left. When  faced  with suffering of any kind—loss of wealth or imprisonment—one need not be concerned about the future of one’s family. He who has given us teeth will provide us with food to eat. If He provides for  such dangerous creatures as the snake, the scorpion, the tiger and the wolf, He is not likely to be unmindful of mankind. It is not a pound of millets or a handful of corn that we hanker after, but the delights of the palate; not just the clothes that we need to enable us to bear cold, but garments of brocaded silk. If we abandon all this restless craving, there will hardly be any need for anxiety as to the means for maintaining one’s family.
 In this connection, it is worth while to bear in mind that many of these things have to be sacrificed even if physical force is resorted to. One is obliged to suffer hunger and thirst, to bear heat and cold, to sacrifice family bonds, to put up with pecuniary loss. The Boers went through all this when they resorted to physical force. The one great difference between the physical resistance that they offered and our resistance based on truth is that the game they played was in the nature of a gamble. Physical strength, moreover, has  made them proud. Their partial success made them forgetful of their former condition. Having fought with deadly arms against a deadly enemy, they are bearing hard upon us as deadly tyrants. When a satyagrahi wins in battle, his success cannot but be beneficial to him and to others. A satyagrahi, if he is to remain loyal to truth, can never be a tyrant.
 This inquiry, then, leads at last to the conclusion that he alone can offer satyagraha who has true faith in religion. “The name of Rama on the lips, and a dagger nuder the arm”libtech_636_footnotelibtech_637_footnote—that is no faith. It is no religion to speak in its name and to do exactly the opposite of what it teaches. But anyone who has true religion and faith in him can offer satyagraha. In other words, he who leaves everything to God can never know defeat in this world. Such men are not defeated in fact simply because people say that they are defeated. So also one cannot claim success simply because people believe that one has succeeded. [There can be no arguing about this;] if you know the difference, you know it, else you don’t.
 This is the real nature of satyagraha. The Transvaal Indians have partially understood it. Having done so, they have been faithful to it in practice, again partially. Even so, we have been able to taste its priceless sweetness. He who has sacrificed everything for satyagraha has gained everything, for he lives in contentment. Contentment is happiness. Who has ever known any happiness other than this? Every other kind of happiness is but a mirage. The nearer we approach it, the farther it recedes.
 We hope that every Indian will think of the matter this way and make himself a satyagrahi. If we learn the use of the weapon of satyagraha, we can employ it to overcome all hardships originating from injustice. It is not here [in South Africa] alone that the weapon is useful; it will be more so in our home-country. Only we must know its true nature, which is easy to do, and yet difficult. Men of great physical strength are rare. Rarer still must be those who derive their strength from truth.

211,,MY THIRD EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [-I],"
  
 VOLKSRUST
 When, on February 25, I was sentenced to three month’s imprisonment with hard labour and I embraced my fellow-prisoners and my son in the Volksrust Gaol, I did not imagine that I would have much to say or write about this pilgrimage to gaol. But  my expectation, like many other expectations of man, proved false. The experience I had this time was somethings new altogether. What I have learnt from this I would not have been able to learn even from years of study. I think these three months have been of inestimable value to me. In that brief period, I had many vivid experiences of satyagraha and I think I am a better satyagrahi today than I was three months ago. For all this, thanks are due to the local (the Transvaal) Government.
 Some officers had sworn that I should in no circumstances get less than six months’ imprisonment this time. My fellow-prisoners— elderly and prominent Indians—and my son—were all serving a six months’term each, so that I wanted the officers’wish to be fulfilled. However, since I had been charged under the Regulations framed under the Act,libtech_638_footnoteI was afraid that three months would be the utmost I might get, and that is what happened .
 After the sentence had been passed, it was a pleasure to join Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Rustomjee, Mr. Sorabji, Mr. Pillay, Mr. Hajurasingh, Mr. Lalbahadursingh and other veterans. Except ten of them, all were provided with beds in tents pitched on the ground in front of the gaol. The scene had therefore the appearance of an armed camp rather than a gaol. Everyone liked sleeping in a tent. Arrangements for food were satisfactory. As on previous occasions, cooking was in our own hands. It was therefore possible to prepare food to our taste. In all there were about 77 (satyagrahi) prisoners.
 Those who were taken outside for work were set a rather difficult task. They had to build a road in front of the magistrate’s court. This required quarrying out stone, digging into heaps of stones that had been piled up, and carrying them in loads. After the work on the road
 
 was over, they were set to uproot the grass in the school compound. But, on the whole , everyone worked cheerfully.
 I also went with the gangs for three days to join in this work. There was a telegram meanwhile that I should not be taken for work outside. I was rather disappointed, for I liked going out. It improved my health and kept me fit. Ordinarily, I have two meals a day, but on account of this exercise, the stomach insisted on my having three meals while in Volksrust Gaol. I was now assigned only the work of sweeping. That kind of work, I thought, would do me no good. And then came a time when I was denied even this.
 WHY WAS I MADE TO LEAVE VOLKSRUST?
 On March 2, I heard that my removal to Pretoria had been ordered. I was asked to get ready the same day. It was raining, the roads were bad; despite this, my warder and I were obliged to leave, with my luggage on my head. I was taken by the evening train the same day in a third-class carriage.
 Some thought that this might possibly mean a settlement; others felt that the intention was probably to harass me by isolating me from the rest. Some also thought that the object might be to keep me in Pretoria and give me more freedom and better facilities so as to  prevent a discussion in the House of Commons.
 I did not like leaving Volksrust. Happy during the day, the evenings too we passed in cheerful conversation. Mr. Hajurasingh and Mr. Joshi, especially, asked a number of questions, which were in no way flippant but were quite instructive. Which satyagrahi would like to leave a place where conditions were so happy and where the largest number of Indians were congregated?
 But man would not be man if things always happened as he wished. And so I left. On the way, Mr. Kajee saluted me. The warder and I found ourselves huddled up in a compartment. It was cold, and it rained the whole night. I had my overcoat with me, which I was allowed to put on. I felt a little better after that. I had been given bread and cheese to eat on the way. I did not touch them, since I had had my meal before starting. They were consumed by the warder.
 IN PRETORIA GAOL
 I reached Pretoria on the 3rd. Everything appeared unfamiliar. Even the gaol is of recent construction. The men were strangers. They gave me something to eat, but I had no appetite. They placed before
 me mealie meal porridge; I tasted a spoonful, and left it off. The warder was surprised. I told him that I was not hungry. He smiled. Then I passed on to the charge of another warder. He said: “Gandhi, take off your cap.” I did so. He then asked me: “Are you Gandhi’s son?” “No,” I replied, “my son is serving six months in Volksrust.”  I was then locked up in a cell. I began pacing up and down. Before long, the warder peeped through the watch-hole, saw what I was doing and shouted: “Gandhi, stop walking about like that: my floor is being spoiled.” I stopped, and stood in a corner. I had nothing even to read.  I had not yet received my books. I must have been locked in at eight. At ten, I was taken to the physician. He asked me if I suffered from any contagious disease, and dismissed me. Was locked in again. At eleven, I was removed to another small cell. It was in this that I spent the rest of my term. It was a cell of the kind intended for one prisoner at a time. It measured, I believe, ten feet long and seven broad. The floor was covered with black pitch. The warders were constantly engaged in keeping it shining. For ventilation, it had a very small glass window, with iron bars. It was provided with an electric light for keeping a watch on the prisoner during the night. The light is not meant for the prisoner’s use, for it is not powerful enough to read by. Standing close to it, I could read a book printed in large type. The light is put out exactly at eight. But it is switched on five or six times in the night when the warders have a look at the prisoner through the watch-hole mentioned above.
 After eleven, the Deputy-Governor came. I asked for three  things from him: books, permission to write to my wife who was ill, and a small bench to sit on. As to the first, the reply was: “I shall see”; as to the second: “Yes”; as to the third: “No.” When, however, I wrote in Gujarati, the letter was returned to me with the remark that I should write in English. I said in reply that my wife did not know English, that my letters served as medicine for her, that they contained nothing of special significance. In spite of this, however, I did not get the permission. I refused to avail myself of the permission to write in English. The same evening my books were handed over to me.
 When the midday meal arrived, I had to eat it in the  cell  standing, with the doors shut. At about three, I asked permission to take a bath. The sopt for bathing must have been at a distance of about 125 feet. The warder replied: “All right. Undress (make
 yourself naked) and go.” I asked him if this was  necessary,  suggesting that I could place my clothes on the screen. He then gave his permission, but asked me to be quick. While I had yet to wipe my body after bath, the gentleman shouted: “Are you ready, Gandhi?” I said I would not take long. I hardly ever got an opportunity to see an Indian face. When it was evening, I was given a blanket, with half a piece in addition, and a coir mat by way of bedding; there was no pillow or bed-board. Even when I went for evacuation, a warder stood by to keep watch. If by chance he did not know me, he would shout: “Sam, come out now.” But Sam had the bad habit of taking a long time for evacuation; how could he get out so soon, and if he did, how would he feel easy in bowels afterwards? Sometimes a [white] warder, and sometimes a Kaffir, would thus stand by, and keep peeping over or shouting to the refrain of “Get up”, “Get up”.
 The next day, I was given the work of polishing the floor and doors. The latter were made of varnished iron. What was the point of polishing them every day? I have often spent three hours at a stretch on polishing one door. But I could not observe the  slightest  difference. Yes, it did make some difference to the floor. There were some Kaffirs working with me. They would sometimes talk in broken English of how they had come to be imprisoned, and ask  me  questions about my imprisonment. One asked me whether I had committed theft, and another whether I had been imprisoned for selling liquor. When I explained the correct position to one of the intelligent Kaffirs, he exclaimed, “Quite right.”  “ Amlungu  bad”  (The whites are bad). “Don’t pay fine.” My cell bore the description “isolated”. I saw five other cells adjoining mine bearing the same description. My neighbour was a Kaffir who had been serving a term of imprisonment for attempted murder. The three next to him were convicted of sodomy. It was in the company of such men and in such surroundings that I commenced my experience in Pretoria Gaol.
 DIET
 The food was in keeping with the conditions described above. Mealie pap in the morning, mealie pap with potatoes and carrots thrice  a week for the midday meal, beans on other three days and rice without ghee for the evening meal. On Wednesdays, I received beans and rice with ghee for the midday meal, and on Sundays, rice and ghee with mealie pap. It was difficult to eat rice in the absence of ghee. I dicided not to eat it till I was allowed ghee. The mealie pap
 served at breakfast and for the midday meal was sometimes not well cooked, and sometimes it was cooked so as to taste like  rablibtech_639_footnote.  The beans were only half-cooked sometimes, [though] generally they were good. On the days for vegetables, only four small potatoes [were served], which counted towards the [prescribed] eight ounces and, if it was the turn for carrots, only three, and these too rather small-sized. Sometimes I would take four or five spoonfuls of mealie pap in the morning. But on the whole, I spent one and a half months on one meal of beans only at midday. My fellow-prisoners at Volksrust- should realize from this how wrong they were to be angry with our own men when they did not sometimes cook well or when there was occasionally an insufficient supply of a particular item. One may be angry to some purpose, when our own friends attend to the cooking. What could one do in the circumstances described above? It would be possible, of course, to express one’s resentment. But I think it would not be proper for us to make any such complaints. How can we comp- lain when there are hundreds of prisoners who accept these things? A complaint must have only one object—to secure relief for other priso- ners. How would it mend matters if I were occasionally to complain to the warder about the small quantity of potatoes and so get him to serve me a little more? I once observed him giving me [an additional helping] from a portion meant for another, and thereafter gave up complaining altogether.
 That no ghee was allowed with rice in the evening I knew before-hand, and I was determined to have the matter set right. I immediately brought it to the notice of the Chief Warder. He replied that ghee was allowed only with the midday meal on Wednesdays and Sundays in lieu of meat. He asked me to approach the physician if I wanted it oftener. The next day I asked for permission to see the physician. I was taken to him.
 I asked him to order ghee for all Indian prisoners in lieu of fat. The Chief Warder was present. He said, “Gandhi’s demand is not justified. Most of the Indians have been taking fat, and even meat. Those who refuse fat are given plain rice, which they readily accept. When there were satyagrahi prisoners here, they also accepted it. They were weighed when entering and again when leaving the gaol. It was found that they all weighed more when leaving.” The physician asked me, “Come on, now, what do you say to this?” I said I could not
 
 believe it. And speaking for myself, I said, I would certainly suffer in health if I had to go without ghee. The physician said that in that case he would order bread for me. I thanked him, but told him that I had not approached him specially for myself. So long as ghee was not ordered for everyone, I could not accept bread. Whereupon he said, “Please don’t blame me now.”
 What was I to do now? If the Chief Warder had not intervened, ghee would have been ordered. The same day, I was offered bread and rice. I was hungry. But, as matters stood, how could a satyagrahi accept the bread? I therefore refused both. The next day I asked for permission to make a petition to the Director of Prisons which was granted.libtech_640_footnoteIn the petition, I cited the instances of Johannesburg and Volksrust [gaols] and asked for ghee to be ordered for all prisoners. A reply to the petition was received after 15 days. It was to the effect that, pending the revision of the diet-scale for Indians, I should be given ghee with rice every day. Since I did not know the exact terms of the order, I readily accepted rice, ghee and bread on the first day. I pointed out that there was no need for bread, but was told that it had been ordered by the physician and so would continue to be supplied. Hence, I went on accepting that also for 15 days.libtech_641_footnotelibtech_642_footnoteBut my joy lasted no more than a day. I discovered the next day the terms of the order mentioned above, so that I again declined to accept rice, ghee and bread. I told the Chief Warder that I would not accept ghee so long as it was not ordered for every Indian. The Deputy-Governor, who was present, replied, “As you please.”
 I wrote again to the Director. I had been informed that the diet- scale would be modified so as to bring it in line with the one in force in Natal. I expressed dissatisfaction with this and stated the reasons why I could not accept ghee. In the end, after more than a month and a half in all had elapsed, I was informed that ghee had been ordered for Indian prisoners wherever there was a large number of them [in one gaol]. It may thus be said that I broke the self-denial (roza) nearly a month and a half after I had taken up the matter. During nearly the whole of the concluding month [of my term of imprisonment], I took rice, ghee and bread, but went without a meal in the morning; and even after I had started taking rice and bread,
 
 whenever I was served mealie pap for the midday meal I would hardly take ten spoonfuls, fot it had a different taste every day. The bread and ghee, however, stood me in good stead, and I was restored to health.
 I have said above that I was restored to health, for it had broken down during the time that I lived on only one meal a day. I had lost my strength and had severe neuralgic pain in the head for ten days, and had also developed symptoms of some affection in the lungs.
 CHANGE OF WORK
 There was another reason why the lungs had been affected. I said above that I was asked to polish the floor and doors. After ten days of this work, I was given two worn-out blankets to be sewn into one. This was rather intricate work. It required me to bend down the whole day towards the floor, and that, too, while sitting in the cell. This used to give me back-ache by evening, and my eyes also began to feel the strain. Besides, I had all along believed that the air in the cell was unwholesome. Once or twice I asked the Chief Warder to give me some work outside, such as digging, etc. If that was not possible, I asked to be allowed to work on the blankets in the open air. He rejected both requests. I brought this matter also to the notice of the Director. In the end, the physician passed the [necessary] order and I was allowed to sew the blankets in the open air. If that had not been done, I think I would have suffered still more in health. There were some other difficulties after the order was passed, which it is not necessary to describe here. It so happened, therefore, that I got permission to work in the open air at about the same time that a change in my diet was ordered. The resulting gain was twofold. When  I was [first] given a blanket to sew, it was expected that it would take a week to finish it, so that my entire term would be taken up with that work. But, contrary to expectations, after the first blanket had been finished, I could manage to sew a pair into one in two days. So they found some other work for me, such as knitting a sweater, stitching purses for holding tickets, etc.
 I had earlier told many satyagrahis that, if anyone came out of gaol with impaired health, that would be a reflection on his spirit of satyagraha, for it should be possible for us, given sufficient patience, to find remedies [for all difficulties in gaol]. Moreover, one might suffer in health through worry. The satyagrahi must learn to live in gaol as if it were a palace. Arguing thus, I used to feel anxious lest I
 myself should have to leave gaol in poor health. The reader must remember that I had suffered in health in the course of satyagraha because I could not accept ghee which had been ordered for me alone. But this rule does not apply to others. Whenever there is a single [Indian] prisoner in gaol, he can represent his own grievances for redress. In Pretoria I had a special reason for not doing so, and that is why I was not in a position to accept ghee when ordered for me as a special case.

 JOHANNESBURG
 June 2, 1909
 I am happy beyond words today that Indians and Chinese have as-sembled here together. Only yesterday I decided in consultation with the Chairman of the British Indian Association that Mr. Aswat should be invited here and entertained at Mr. Cachalia’s. I did not think it even possible that my countrymen and the Chinese would come together in such large numbers. I am very happy that these two groups—the Chinese and the Indians—who took part in this struggle, have been brought to-gether. This manner of welcoming heroes like Mr. Quinn and Mr. Aswat deserves no small praise. Both of them are leaders of their respective communities and sincerely cherish their welfare. The more I think about the campaign, the more convinced I am that we are bound to win in the end if we fight with the weapons of goodness and virtue. Whatever the number of those who  are continuing or may continue the fight, the two demands we have made will surely be conceded. If you think of the other things we have gained in this prolonged struggle, you will realize that we have been brought close together through self-sacrifice and mutual co- operation. We are keen on such co-operation. We have now learnt how to maintain our self-respect and how to respect others. There is something in me which tells me that we need not be disappointed even if we get nothing [more at present], for what we have gained so far is
 
 
 not insignificant, and we shall gain much more yet in future. It does not matter if the satyagrahis’ army is a small one. History will tell you that real fighters are but few. In the war between England and Russia, the Light Brigade consisted of only a few men and yet it attained immortal fame. Similarly, satyagrahis will enjoy immortal fame, at least in South Africa. I humbly advise you to follow in the footsteps of Messrs Quinn and Aswat, and may you remain firm in that path till the end and so attain happiness.

 It would not be proper if I did not speak in Gujarati on this occasion of Mr. Aswat’s and Mr. Quinn’s release. This is the least that we can do when Mr. Aswat is released. I mentioned this when Mr. Omarji Sale was released. I shall not say anything more about it. Men can have their way even if they are a few in number. There were thousands who applauded and showed themselves ready for gaol. But only a few come forward now. I am not dissatisfied with this. To any inquiry about his health today, Mr. Aswat says that he is all right; but, according to Mr. Vyas, that is not correct. This brave man [while in gaol] did not obtain tobacco, etc., as personal favour. I am proud of this. He has done all that he promised, and he will act in the same manner till the last. There are very few men who, without hankering after publicity, would act as he has done. To honour others is as good as honouring oneself, for that shows one’s own worth. Yesterday, Messrs Manji, Fakir, Shah, and others whose names I do not remem- ber, came. We could not go to receive them. And they too were not— and are not—hungry for honour. However, it is our bare duty to honour those whom we consider to be our seniors. Mr. Quinn is also the same to us as our two leaders and he has been reduced to much the same condition as theirs. He used to get mealie pap and maize in gaol and when the Governor offered to order rice for him, he said he would accept it only if it was ordered for all Chinese. As the Govern- ment did not agree, he firmly refused the rice, which was no small thing. Truly, Mr. Quinn is a pillar of satyagraha. The Acting Chair-

 man of their Association is now impatient to go to gaol. All these per- sons will have justice at least from God. I feel proud when I come across a man of his type during my experience of our sturggle. I am not disheartened by those who drop off. Be sure victory is ours.

 "
214,,WHO CAN GO TO GAOL?,"
  
 Last week we briefly considered the question: Who can be a satyagrahi? In the Transvaal, satyagraha consists for the most part in going to gaol. But imprisonment is not the end of the matter. Satyagrahis have had to mount the gallows,libtech_645_footnotelibtech_646_footnoteembrace a pillar of red- hot ironlibtech_647_footnotelibtech_648_footnote, suffer being rolled down a mountain, swim in boiling oil in a big frying pan,libtech_649_footnotelibtech_650_footnotewalk through a   blazing  forestlibtech_651_footnotelibtech_652_footnote,  suffer  loss  of  a kingdom and be sold [as slave] in a low-born familylibtech_653_footnotelibtech_654_footnoteand  stay  in  a lion’s den. Thus, satyagrahis have had to pass through  different ordeals in different parts of the world.
 In the Transvaal, the ordeal for the satyagrahis consists merely in going to gaol. Hence, it will be useful to inquire as to who can go to gaol. Some Indians were willing to go to gaol, but did not do so— could not do so—owing to one reason or another. What could have been those reasons? This question will answer itself it we find out who can go to gaol.
 Every person, then, who wants to go to gaol must have, in some measure, the qualities which, as we have seen, are essential in a satyagrahi. But, in addition, he should have the  following  strong points:
 Freedom 	from addiction 	to harmful things. A 	well-disciplined body. Disregard 	for comfortable 	seat or bed. Extreme 	simplicity in food habits. Total 	freedom from false sense of 	prestige or status. 
 
 
352	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
 
  Fortitude. 
 Friends who would go to gaol must particularly have these qualities, (which we may call the six forms of wealth in a prison.) Let us examine each of them. It was our experience that those prisoners who were addicted to smoking, drinking, betel-nuts or even tea found the strain of gaol life too much. In consequence, they either managed to get these things surreptitiously in gaol, that is, abandoned [the path of] truth, or gave up speaking of going to gaol again. One must therefore avoid every form of addiction. One addiction alone is permissible, and that is repeating the name of the Lord in prayer.
 Cowards can never become satyagrahis. Likewise, a physical wreck will not generally be able to bear gaol life. There have been many cases of men who, though physically weak, have braved hardships through sheer will-power. These are exceptions. As a general rule, one must have a healthy and sound constitution; lacking this, some of the prisoners were unable to bear the strain [of gaol-life]. A satyagrahi knows that his body is [as it were] lent to him on hire. He should prove a worthy tenant by keeping it clean and glowing with health.
 One can understand that a man who is accustomed to a spring cot with a soft mattress cannot all at once bring himself to sleep on the floor. One must therefore get rid of this pampering of the body.
 Diet, it seems, has proved to be much the most important problem. That also is not surprising. He who has his tongue under control, being both sparing in speech and moderate in his taste for good food, must be reckoned to have achieved a great conquest. We hardly come across anyone who does not relish good food. Even the poor Kaffirs die with craving for good food. Of course, this is not a simple problem. However those who want to offer themselves for imprisonment in a public cause must learn to master their palate. The proper thing is to offer thanks to God for whatever we get. Every Indian must ponder over the fact that, in India, thirty million out of a population of three hundred million get only one meal a day, and that, too, nothing more than roti and salt. Compared to this, it is not much of a hardship to have to maintain oneself in gaol on three meals a day, each different from the other. Hunger accepts everything. Though one may not feel at ease for a few days, by and by one does come to like gaol food. Any Indian who wants to be a satyagrahi—a prisoner—must accustom himself to simple food  as quickly as
 
 possible.
 A person with a false notion of prestige or status cannot afford to go to gaol. One is subjected there to the authority of the warder and is asked to do work which is thought rather degrading. If one refuses to do such work, considering it dishonourable, or on the ground that one has never done it before, the result will be unwelcome. Whether on thinks of anything as a mark of servitude or not depends entirely on one’s mind. He who is free in his mind will feel as free as a king even when carrying buckets [of night-soil]. Rather than feel that carrying of buckets is a mark of servitude, such a man will consider it  a matter of honour in the present circumstances.
 And last, Lady Fortitude. Everyone starts counting days the moment he is in gaol, with the result that they appear to grow inordinately long. Years wore on while we were outside and were lost to us for ever. And yet we did not think much of that. In gaol, three days appeared to be as long as three years. Why? The answer is that we were not happy to be in gaol. Just as a mother takes pleasure in suffering for the sake of the child, so also must we take pleasure in suffering for the motherland—for truth. One must patiently serve out the full term of one’s imprisonment, bearing always in mind that one could never have passed one’s days outside in the same manner as in gaol and put the time to good use, that is, spent the days in devotion to God, in good thoughts, in self-examination. In this way, going along a single path one will have accomplished two tasks.
 These six qualities, therefore, a [satyagrahi] prisoner must have. There may be other qualities which will suggest themselves to the reader. But we urge every reader to ponder, at any  rate,  the suggestions made above.

 "
215,,MY THIRD EXPERIENCE IN GAOL [–II],"
  
 OTHER CHANGES
 As I mentioned above, the warder in charge of me was somewhat harsh in his behaviour. This did not last long. When he saw that with the Government itself I took up a fighting attitude about food, etc., but carried out all his orders his manner changed, and I was allowed to
 do as I liked. Thus, the difficulties about lavatory, bath, etc., disappeared. Moreover, he never allowed me to feel that I was subject to his authority. His successor was a happy-go-lucky man. He was careful to provide me with all reasonable facilities. He used to say: “I love a man who fights for his people. I am myself something of a fighter. I do not regard you as a prisoner.” Many a time he would console me with such talk.
 Moreover, after a few days they used to let me out into the gaol- yard for half an hour’s stroll in the mornings and similarly, in the evenings. This exercise was continued even after I was allowed to sit outside for work. The rule about exercise applies to all prisoners who have to do work sitting.
 And then the bench which had been refused to me was later sent by the Chief Warder of his own accord. Meanwhile, I received from General Smuts two books on religion, and I inferred from this that it was not under his orders that I had been subjected to hardships, but that it was the result of his negligence and that of others, as also a consequence of the fact that we are equated with the Kaffirs. One thing appeared certain, that the only object of isolating me was to see that I had no opportunity of talking to anyone. With some effort, I could also secure a pencil and a note book.
 DIRECTOR’S VISIT
 
 Within a few days of my being brought to Pretoria, Mr. Lichtenstein came to see me with special permission. He had come on official business, but he made inquiries about my health, etc. I was reluctant to give a reply, but, being pressed, I said to him: “Without going into details, I shall only say that I am being subjected to brutal treatment. General Smuts wants to bend me, but I am not likely to succumb. I am prepared to suffer everything. My mind is at peace. Please do not make this public. I shall tell the world everything after my release”. Mr. Lichtenstein conveyed this to Mr. Polak. The latter could not contain himself and talked about it to others. The result was that David Pollock wrote to Lord Selborne, and an inquiry was made. There was a visit by the Director, to whom I said exactly what I had said to Lichtenstein. In addition, I also pointed out the other discomforts which I mentioned in the beginning. As a result of this, they sent me ten days later a bedboard, a pillow, a night-shirt and a
 handkerchief.   I   accepted   them.   In   the   statementlibtech_655_footnotewhich   I   have submitted on this matter, I have pointed out that all the Indians [in gaol] stand in need of these things. In fact, Indians are more comfort- loving than whites in regard to sitting and sleeping. They find it difficult to do without a pillow.
 Thus, simultaneously with improvement in diet and facilities for work in the open air, I was provided with better comfort for sleeping, as described above. But man can never escape his fate. The bed-board was full of bugs. I did not use it even for ten days. At last, the Chief Warder had it repaired and I started using it. Meanwhile, I had grown used to sleeping on a blanket spread out on the floor. The bed-board, therefore, appeared to have made no difference to me. In the absence of a pillow, I had been using my books for the purpose, so that even the provision of a pillow made little difference to me.
 HANDCUFFED
 The conclusion to which I had been led by my initial treatment [in Pretoria Gaol] was confirmed by the following incident. Four days later, I was summoned as a witness in Mrs. Pillay’s case. I was, accordingly, taken to the court. I was handcuffed on the occasion.libtech_656_footnoteMoreover, the warder locked up the handcuffs rather tight. I think he did this unintentionally. The Chief Warder saw this. I had obtained his permission to carry a book with me to read [on the way]. Thinking probably that I felt ashamed of the handcuffs, he asked me to hold the book with both hands, so that the handcuffs might not be seen. I was rather amused at this. To me the handcuffs were a matter of honour. It happened by chance that the title of the book which I was carrying, if rendered in Gujarati, would be: Khuda-no Darbar Tara antar-man Chhe.libtech_657_footnotelibtech_658_footnoteI  regarded  this  as  a   wonderful   coincidence.   Whatever  the difficulties that pressed on me from outside, so long as I kept my heart worthy of God’s presence in it, what need had I to  mind anything else? I was taken on foot in this fashion. For the return journey, a truck was sent from the gaol. Indians must have come to know that I was to be brought [to the court]; some of them were, therefore, present there. From among them, Mr. Tryambaklal Vyas was able to see me through Mrs. Pillay’s lawyer.
 
 I was also taken to the court on another occasion, this time, too, in handcuffs. There was a truck to carry us to the court as also to bring us back.
 MAGIC POWER O F SATYAGRAHA
 Some of the facts which I have given above will appear rather trivial, but they have been described in such detail in order to show that satyagraha is feasible in every situation, serious or otherwise. The result of my having submitted to the physical hardships inflicted by the junior warder was that I could preserve my peace of mind. Not only that, the warders themselves removed all those hardships. If I had resisted, that would have distracted my energies from the bigger tasks on hand and the warders would have become my enemies.
 On the question of food also, I remained firm in my principles and bore some hardships initially, with the result that this difficulty, too, disappeared. The same thing can also be seen [to have happened] in respect of the smaller difficulties.
 The biggest gain, however, has been that I find myself, beyoud any shadow of doubt, to have grown in mental  strength  in consequence of having endured physical suffering. I believe that the last three months have been of great profit to me and I am ready today to bear much heavier suffering without flinching. I see that satyagraha is assured of divine help, and that in testing a satyagrahi the Creator imposes on him at every step only as much burden as he can bear.
 MY READING
 The story of my suffering or of my happiness, or rather of both, ends here. But I had a great many benefits in the course of these three months. One of the most important, to be sure, was that I got an opportunity for reading. I must admit that, during the earlier part [of my imprisonment], I often found myself lost in thought and felt dejected. The moment I had succeeded in withdrawing my mind from an unpleasant thought, it would again wander off like a monkey. In such circumstances, men often go mad. My books saved me. Thanks to them, I did not feel much the absence of contacts with Indian friends. Everyday I had three hours for reading. I had an hour to myself in the morning, which could be spared [for reading] because I went without a breakfast. It was the same about evening. At noon, I read while eating. Besides, in the evening, I continued reading even
 after the light was switched on, if I was not too tired. On Saturdays and Sundays, I had plenty of time on land. I read over 30 books during this period, and reflected on some of them; among these, there were books in English, Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit and Tamil. Notable among the English books, I would say, were those by Tolstoy, Emerson and Carlyle. The first two were on religious subjects. Along with these, I also borrowed a copy of the Bible from the gaol. Tolstoy’s writings are so good and simple that a man belonging to any religion can profit by them. Moreover, he tries to put into practice what he  preaches, so that, by and large, they command greater confidence.
 There is a forceful book by Carlyle on the French Revolution. I realized after reading it that it is not from the white nations that India can learn the way out of her present degradation. It is my belief that the French people have gained nothing of value through the Revolution. Mazzini also thought the same way. There is much difference of opinion on this subject. We cannot enter  into a discussion on it here. I came across many instances of satyagraha even in this history.
 The books in Gujarati, Hindi and Sanskrit which I read were Veda-Shabda-Sangna, sent by Swamiji, the  Upanishads  received from Bhatt Keshavram, the Manusmriti received form Mr. Motilal Diwan, the Ramayana printed in Phoenix, Patanjal-Yoga-Darshan, Ahnika-Prakasha prepared by Nathuramji, and Sandhya-ni Gutika, Given by Professor Parmanand, the Gita and the writings of the late worthy poet Raychandlibtech_659_footnotelibtech_660_footnote. All of them gave me much food for thought. The Upanishads proved a great source of peace to me. One statement in them has made a deep impression on my mind; in substance, it means that everything one does must be done for the welfare of the soul. The thought is expressed in words of great beauty. There is much else in it worthy of attention.
 But it was the writings of the poet Raychand which proved the most satisfying. So far as I can judge, they should appeal to all. His way of life was noble, like Tolstoy’s. I memorized a portion of his writings and of the book on Sandhya. I would repeat them over and over again in my mind whenever I happened to wake up at night, and every morning I spent half an hour meditating on them. I would recite most of what I had memorized, and this kept me cheerful all the time. If ever I gave way to despair, I would smile with happiness again the
 
 moment I went back in thought to what I had read, and would be filled with gratitude to God. On this subject, too, I have a great many thoughts which I should like to place before the readers. But this is not the occasion to do so. I shall only say this, that in these days good books partly make up for the absence of good men with whom we can cultivate contacts, and that, therefore, every Indian who wants to be happy in gaol must form the habit of reading good books.
 STUDY OF TAMIL
 No other Indians can equal the performance of the Tamils in this fight. It therefore occurred to me that I should read Tamil with close attention, if for no other reason than to tender sincere thanks to them at least mentally. Accordingly, the last one month was devoted mostly to the study of Tamil. The more I learn it, the better  I appreciate the beauties of this language. It is a very fine and sweet language, and from its structure and from what I have read in it, I find that the Tamils have produced, and still produce, a large number of intelligent, thoughtful and wise men. Moreover, since India is going to be one country, some Indians outside Madras should also learn Tamil.
 CONCLUSION
 I wish that everyone who reads this account  of experience should cultivate patriotism, if he does not have it, and learn satyagraha therefrom, and if he has it already, be more firm in it. I am growing more convinced every day that no one who does not know his religion can have true patriotism in him.
For the rest—
The sky rings with the name of the Invisible,
 I sit rapt in the temple, my heart filled with gladness; Taking up an asanalibtech_661_footnote, they face immovable,
I have pitched my tent in the abode of the Inscrutable.
Moreover—
 Take to the life of a fakir and yield not to despondency, Let the mind be always rapt with joy.
 It is possible to practise renunciation while living in the world of men. And the last question is, how does one find Khuda-Ishvar?
The poet answers—
 
 When, smiling and playing my way through life, I see [Him] revealed to me, a visible presence,
 Then shall I consider my life to have attained its true end; He who has seen Him even in a dream,
 Will cease chasing the shadows in vain. [From Gujarati]

 [GERMISTON,
 June 7, 1909]
 Mr. Gandhi, who was well received, on rising, said that, although he had chosen passive resistance as his subject that evening, he did not wish to deal with the Indian question, except in so far as it might be necessary  to  illustrate  any proposition. Passive resistance, the speaker proceeded, was a misnomer. But the expression had been accepted as it was popular and had been for a long time used by those who carried out in practice the idea denoted by the term. The idea was more completely and better expressed by the term “soul force”. As such, it was as old as the human race. Active resistance was better expressd by the term “body force”. Jesus Christ, Daniel and Socrates represented the purest form of passive resistance or soul force. All these teachers counted their bodies as nothing in comparison to their souls. Tolstoy was the best and brightest exponent of the doctrine. He not only expounded it, but lived according to it. In India, the doctrine was understood and commonly practised long before it came into vogue in Europe. It was easy to see that soul force was infinitely superior to body force. If people in order to secure redress of wrongs resorted to soul force, much of the present suffering would be avoided. In any case, the wielding of this force never caused suffering to others. So that, whenever it was misused, it only injured the users and not those against whom it was used. Like virtue, it was its own reward. There was no such thing as failure in the use of this kind of force. “Resist not evil” meant that evil was not to be repelled by evil but by good; in other words, physical force was to be opposed not by its like but by soul force. The same idea was expressed in Indian philosophy by the expression “freedom from injury to every living thing”. The exercise of this doctrine involved  physical suffering on the part of those who practised it. But it was a known fact that the sum of
 
 
 such suffering was greater rather than less in the world. That being so, all that was necessary for those who recognized the immeasurable power of soul force was to consciously and deliberately accept physical suffering as their lot, and, when this was done, the very suffering became a source of joy to the sufferer. It was quite plain that passive resistance, thus understood, was infinitely superior to physical force and that it required greater courage than the latter. No transition was, therefore, possible from passive resistance to active or physical resistance. The Colonists would, therefore, see that no exception could be taken to Indians making use of this force in order to obtain a redress of their grievances. Nor could such a wcapon, if used by the Natives, do the slightest harm. On the contrary, if the Natives could rise so high as to understand and utilize this force, there would probably be no native question left to be solved. The one condition of a successful use of this force was recognition of the existence of the soul as apart from the body, and its permanent and superior nature. And this recognition must amount to a living faith and not a mere intellectual grasp. The speaker illustrated his lecture with several modern illustrations.libtech_663_footnote

THE TRANSVAAL LEADER
JOHANNESBURG]
SIR,
 The Colonial Secretary has laid the Indian community under obli-gation, by returning a prompt and decisive  reply  to  Mr. Munnik’s charges against the British Indian community. The honou- rable Mr. Munnik says that Asiatic children about 12 year old, whose parents have never been in the country, have been entering  the  country and evading the law. If 59 Asiatics only have entered the
 
 Transvaal during the six months, and these are evidently all authorised entrants, it is evident that the libel uttered by Mr. Munnik against the whole community is groundless, and, unless the honourable gentlman has anything else to support the accusation, and unless it is placed before the public, it is in my opinion, due to the community that the honourable gentleman should withdraw the charges made by him.
 I am etc.,

 "
218,,SOME SUGGESTIONS,"
  
 Satyagraha will end some day, no matter when. But, meanwhile, we give below instances, without offering any argument, of the benefits the Indian community has already derived and the fruits it has tasted; every Indian should ponder over these:
 The 	Rhodesian law 	has been defeated.  Lord 	Crewe has clearly 	stated that the 	[Rhodesian] Act 	has been 	disallowed because 	of the 	satyagraha campaign 	in the Transvaal.  Lord 	Crewe has stated 	in the 	same communication that 	the Imperial 	Government did not feel 	happy in giving 	assent to 	the Transvaal Act.  In 	the Blue-book 	recently issued, 	Lord Crewe 	has recommended that 	both demands of 	the Indians 	should be conceded.  The 	Transvaal Government in 	its reply has 	not rejected the 	recommendation 	[outright], but has 	explicitly stated 	that the 	satyagraha campaign has 	for the most part 	collapsed and 	that, if Lord 	Crewe waited, the 	remaining Indians would 	also give in. (This is 	a clear indication that, 	if satyagraha had 	been continued 	by a large 	number of 	Indians, our 	demands would have 	been met long before 	this.)  Many 	whites who knew 	nothing about Indians 	till now have 	not only 	come to know 	what they are, but have 	also been working 	for our cause. 
Each of these instances will suggest a number of reflections. We
 
 shall elaborate them some time later for the benefit of our readers. Meanwhile, we hope that many Indians will ponder over and derive fresh strength from them. It is clear, at any rate, that it depends on us whether or not we shall win. We fail, then, to understand why so many Indians have been disheartened.

219,,INDIANS IN THE CAPE,"
  
 Indians in the Cape have been slumbering. The Immigration Officer is wide awake. The immigration report of the Cape is worth reading and pondering over by every Indian in the Colony. Here we intend to emphasize only two points. Mr. Cousins (the Chief Officer) states that many Indians bring in others’ children representing them as their own, and give wrong information about their ages. Under these circumstances, Mr. Cousins suggests that the law be so amended as to require every Indian to bring with him a  (Government) certificate from India testifying to the boy’s age and stating that the boy is his own son. The two facts are related to each other as cause and effect. It is because some Indians practise deception, as stated above, that Mr. Cousins has put forward a new suggestion. We are bound to suffer so long as we continue to resort to falsehood. It is always harmful to violate a law on the sly. Should we disapprove of any law, it would be to our advantage to violate it openly, if we have the courage to do so. We should know when to violate a law in this way. the Cape Indians need to act with great caution; first, to cast out the falsehood in us, should there be any, and, second, to represent to the Government without the slightest delay that Mr. Cousins’ suggestion is improper. We shall give elsewhere the other facts mentioned in the report.

220,,JOHANNESBURG LETTER,"
  
 VISIT TO HOUTPOORT PRISONERS
 Indian prisoners in Houtpoort Gaol, near Heidelberg, were visited by Mr. Gandhi, Mr. and Ms. Vyas and Mr. Shelat. All the prisoners were found to be in good health. It was also observed that, for some time past, the officers there have been behaving rather well.
 Mr. Nanalal Shah is in this gaol. His being sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, because he refrained from using his certificates, proves him to be a man of courage; likewise, his work and conduct in gaol have been excellent. He has endeared himself to everyone. He also gives to everyone portions from his own quota of food. All the prisoners released from the gaol testify to this. Mr. Manji Nathubhai, Mr. Khimchand Shah and Mr. Parbhu Kuber are unanimous in their praise of Mr. Nanalal Shah.
 Though Mr. Bhayat is in gaol, prisoners continue to receive help from his store. Whenever a prisoner is released, a carriage is generally sent to receive him. I use the word “generally” because when Mr. Manji, Mr. Khimchand and Mr. Parbhu were released, no carriage was sent to receive them. Since Mr. Manji had been fasting and Mr. Khimchand was in poor health, they were put to considerable hardship. Moreover, as the telegram intimating their arrival in Johannesburg was not received in time, no one could go to the station to receive them. Such hardships need not frighten any satyagrahi. These too must be borne. Mistakes will always happen through oversight.
 ASWAT’S GREATNESS
 Mr. Aswat endured much suffering in the Diepkloof Gaol. He has lost about 30 pounds in weight. It seems he acted in perfect conformity with the spirit of satyagraha. He did not even so much as touch food other than what he got in gaol. He was a confirmed smoker, but he did not smoke even once during the three months [of his imprisonment]. Indifferent to his business, he has offered to go to gaol again. While I am writing about Mr. Aswat, it occurs to me that Mr. Thambi Naidoo has given up smoking, tea and coffee for ever, though, before he went to gaol, he could not do without any of these things even for an hour. He has, moreover, pledged himself not to
 allow his moustache to grow so long as the struggle is on. So long as the community has such heroes among its members,  the  fight is bound to countinue and ultimate victory is assured.
 THE MORAL
 It has come to my knowledge that some of the satyagrahi prisoners have learnt to resort to underhand ways in gaol. Formerly they would not eat anything which was not openly available for all or which others could not get; now they do so. Those who were not used to chewing tobacco or smoking have now learnt to do so. Such prisoners should be ashamed of themselves, and ought to emulate the examples of Mr. Aswat and Mr. Naidoo. The more faithfully the community observes the spirit of satya-graha, the earlier will come the end, and the more indifferent it grows, the more will satyagraha be prolonged. The reasoning is simple enough.
 DEPORTATION
 Prompt steps are being taken about deportations to India. Mr. Isaac has been sent to Delagoa Bay in connection with that. I hope Delagoa Bay Indians will help him. At the same time, correspondence is also going on with the Government. Mr. Narottam Kalidas, who was sentenced to deportation, has been released and is enjoying himself in Johannesburg. However, there is no reason why we should be afraid even of deportation. Men with courage, even if deported, can continue the fight in the home-country as well. Telegrams have been sent to India to have proper arrangements made for those who, though they are satya-grahis, have nevertheless been deported or may be deported in future. Be-sides, Mr. Somabhai Patel, who was only recently released and has gone to India on some work, has decided to do his best about this in Bombay.
 INDIAN WASHERMEN IN PRETORIA
 The Pretoria Town Council has passed the following resolutions on the recommendation of its Health Committee:
  That 	the resolution of 	August 1907, 	which denied the 	use of 	the Municipal 	wash-houses to Indian 	laundrymen and 	required them 	to provide 	a proper 	water supply 	and washing 	accommodation at 	their own 	laundries, be rescinded. That 	the resolution 	of May 	1908, to 	the effect that all 
 laundrymen be excluded from the Municipal wash-houses, be rescinded.
  That 	in future 	all Coloured 	persons, irrespective of 	nationality, be permitted 	to use the Municipal wash- houses.  That 	instructions be 	issued to 	the caretakers 	of the 	wash- houses to exercise 	the strictest supervision to prevent waste of water. 
 RELEASED BECAUSE OF ILLNESS
 Information has been received that Mr. Mahomed Mamuji Patel, of Mr. Bhayat’s store, who was in Volksrust Gaol, has been released by the Government on account of ill-health.
 MAHOMED AHMED BHABHA
 Mr. Mahomed Ahmed Bhabha of Standerton, who was in the Hout-poort Gaol, was released on Saturday last. Mr. Bhayat’s carriage was sent to fetch him, and he was entertained as a guest at  Mr. Bhayat’s. I hope Mr. Bhabha will be ready to court arrest again.
 BHAYAT
 He will be released on the day on which this issue is published, that is, June 12. It is believed that, after his release, other Indians of Heidelberg will come forward to court arrest.
 TAILORS, KANBIS, ETC.
 Some tailors, Kanbislibtech_665_footnoteand others have been arrested. They do not all appear to be satyagrahis. Some of them have applied [for registration] under the new Act. It also appears that many of them deserve to be deported. If such Indians resort to satyagraha, they and the community will both stand to gain. By doing so, they may even escape deportation. Many Indians can be in gaol, if only they want to. Mr. Aswat’s store offers one Indian as sacrifice every day. Many Indians can manage to be in gaol by offering themselves for the honour of being in charge of the store. So far, it is mostly the Tamil heroes who have done so. This is a matter of shame to other Indians. Under these circumstances, if those tailors, Kanbis and other Indians who are threatened elect to go to gaol, they will accomplish two things at a time. In doing this, however, it should be remembered that the
 
 Indians concerned should be men who are entitled to live in the Transvaal. I hope that readers will act upon these suggestions.
 IMAM SAHEB
 Imam Abdool Kadir Bawazeer, who is serving a third term of imprisonment for the community, will be released on the 15th. I hope that every Indian who knows his status, his calling as a priest, and his services, will be at the gaol on that day to do him honour.
 TO BE RELEASED ON THURSDAY
 Messrs E. S. Coovadia, M. P. Fancy, Ahmed Halim, Razak Nur- bhai, Suleman Casmat, Vallabhram Chhanabhai, Narayansami Naidoo and Nayanah Francis will be released on Thursday next. Arrangeme- nts are being made to give them a fitting welcome. I hope that every- one will be present at the gaol on Thursday morning to receive them.
 BRITISH INDIAN CONCILIATION COMMITTEE
 
 A meeting of this Committee was held on Sunday last in the Hamidia Islamic Society’s hall. Many Indians were present. From Standerton there was Mr. Hajee Ismail Amod, from Pretoria Mr. Khamisa, from Zeerust Mr. Hajee Cassim and from Krugersdorp Mr. Mahomed Kajee. Among the gentlemen from Johannesburg, there were Mr. Abdool Ganie, Mr. Halim Mahomedlibtech_666_footnote, Mr. George Godfrey, Mr. Dadabhai, Mr. Shahboodeen and others. The Committee has been set up to help the cause of the satyagrahis. Those who have found themselves unable to participate in the gaol-going and other program- mes [of the satyagraha campaign] can join this Committee. Mr. Hajee Habib is the Chairman. Mr. George Godfrey is its Honorary Secret- ary. Mr. Gandhi attended the meeting by special invitation. Mr. Hajee Habib dealt with a great many points in his introductory remarks. He said that in regard to the struggle, Mr. Gandhi had acted hastily at the time of the settlementlibtech_667_footnote. Had he not done so and had insisted on having everything in writing from General Smuts, the community would not have had to go through so much suffering. However, [he said] they were concerned at present with bringing about the end of the struggle itself. It was the duty of every Indian to help secure the release of their
 
 brethren who had courted imprisonment. It was not proper to call those who refused to go to gaol blacklegs. They must all live in harm- ony with one another. The Committee [he continued] would make a petition to General Smuts. Act No. 36 had failed to provide for several things. Many persons were deprived of their rights. Minors were subjected to harassment. One was not allowed to enter the Transvaal first and then make the application.libtech_668_footnoteFinger-impressions were deman- ded from everyone. All these grievances [he said] called for redress. Real satyagraha, it might be claimed, was offered by Mir Alam alone. He declined even to show his permit and had been deported for that. Indian Opinion very often published tendentious articles and reports which, he thought, was not quite proper. A man like Mr. Khanderia used to encourage others to go to gaol, but he himself got cold feet when it was his turn to go to gaol, and paid the fine; yet, there was no comment on him in Indian Opinion, which was obviously unfair. He also believed that it was necessary to send a deputation to Europe.
 The resolution to set up a Committee was proposed by Mr. Hajee Ojer Ally. Introducing the resolution, he said that the meeting was being held because Mr. Gandhi had suggested that those who had not gone to gaol or did not wish to, could also help the community. The resolution was supported by Mr. Halim Mahomed and passed unanimously. The second resolution was proposed by Mr. Essop Cachalia; it called for a petition to be made to the Colonial Secretary to press for the acceptance of the satyagrahis’ demands. Moving it, he said that he had burnt his certificate and had not taken out a duplicate, so that he was, he thought, a full-fledged satyagrahi. However, he was introducing the resolution with the permission of the Chairman. If the demands were not accepted, all Indians would again be prepared to court imprisonment.
 The resolution was supported by Mr. Abdool Ganie. Mr. Hajee Ojer Ally and Mr. Abdool Ganie pointed out that, if the demands were not accepted by the Government, the question of people not going to gaol would not arise. Their duty was to extend as much support as possible to those who went to gaol. Mr. Habib Motan then made a long speech. He pointed out several mistakes which [he believed] Mr.
 
 Gandhi had made and asked [him] some questions. He expressed his happiness at the fact that Hindus and Muslims had sat at the same table on the occasion of the tea-party at Mr. Cachalia’s in honour of Mr. Omarji Sale, and wished that the same thing would also happen in india. Mr. Ismail Amod of Standerton then made a short speech. He was followed by Mr. Khamisa and Mr. Ismail Patel.
 Mr. George Godfrey made a statement in English. Mr. Gandhi gave a brief reply and said that, if the Committee worked sincerely and with despatch and energy, it would undoubtedly be of great help to the cause of satyagraha.

 [JOHANNESBURG,

 Afterwards,libtech_670_footnotein open Court, Mr. Thambi Naidoo was charged under Section 9 of the Regulations, Mr. Gandhi appearing on his behalf. He pleaded guilty, and was sentenced in the usual manner to imprisonment with hard labour for three months, in default of paying the fine of £50. Messrs N. A. Cama and G. P. Vyas were afterwards brought before the Court, and charged similarly, On their behalf, Mr. Gandhi pointed out that his clients proposed to plead guilty but applied for a remand for 14 days, owing to the fact that each of the prisoners was responsible for the wellbeing of a near relative who was in a dangerously ill condition. The prosecution raised no objection, and a remand was granted.
 Meanwhile, outside the Court, Messrs A. M. Cachalia, Chairman of the British Indian Association, and V. A. Chettiar, Chairman of the Tamil Benefit Society, had been arrested on similar charge. Mr. Cachalia complained of rough treatment after his arrest, both by the police officer taking him in charge and in the courtyard.
 Mr. Gandhi strongly protested against this treatment, pointing out that it surely could not be any part of the punishment meted out to passive resisters.
 
 Mr. Schuurman, the Magistrate, said that this was really a matter for the Commissioner of Police and not for himself to deal with, as he was able only to deal with the specific charge before him.
 Mr. W. J. MacIntyre, by permission of the Court, stated that, as an officer of the Court, he felt it his duty to confirm the statements that had been made, as he had been an eye-witness to them. He thought that it was a great shame that such treatment should be used to inoffensive men. He had himself frequently seen similar treatment given to Indian passive resisters, even in the presence of the Magistrate, and respectfully protested against it.
 The Magistrate said that he had never noticed such treatment himself. Had he done so, he would never have allowed it. He thought, however, that this was not a matter for him to deal with.
 The prisoners pleading guilty were sentenced to three months’ imprisonment with hard labour.
 Mr. Gandhi, on behalf of Mr. Chettiar, explained that his client was a man of about 50 year of age, and suffering from diabetes.

 [JOHANNESBURG,
 June 16, 1909]
 
MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES, GENTLEMEN AND FRIENDS,
 We have met here this afternoon under somewhat exceptional circumstances, but I cannot say that these circumstances were unexpected. For some weeks the chief members of the Indian community have been discussing among themselves the advisability of sending a deputation to England, in view of the approaching visit to England of Generals Botha and Smuts in connection with unificationlibtech_672_footnote. The European Committee that has been formed in the Transvaal, in order to sympathise with us and to help us in every legitimate way, has also advised that such a deputation should proceed to England. As
 
 
 you know, a large Committee meetinglibtech_673_footnotelibtech_674_footnotewas held last Sunday, and after much debate a resolution was come to by a large majority that a passive resistance deputation should proceed to London  Next Monday. That Committee nominated Mr. Cachalia, the Chairman of the British Indian Association, Mr. Chettiar, representing the Tamil section and Chairman of the Tamil Benefit Society, Mr. Hajee Habib who, although he has not been able to see eye to eye with us up to now, declared himself a passive resister, was also nominated , and myself. There was also a submission made to the meeting that, simultaneously with the English deputation, a deputa-tion should proceed to India, in order that the true situation might be placed before the Indian public, and other names were submitted. Among them were the names of Mr. Polak, the Assistant Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association, Mr. N. Gopal Naidoo, Mr. N. A. Cama, and a fourth name was not given then, but it will be submitted at this meeting, and that is, Mr. Coovadia. To-day we find that the Government have laid their hand upon Mr. Cachalia, and Mr. Cachalia is locked up in the Johannesburg Gaol. He has been sentenced to three months’ impri-sonment with hard labour unless he paid a fine of £50. Mr. Cachalia is now in gaol in connection with this struggle for the fourth time. Mr. Chettiar also has been arrested, and he is undergoing imprisonment for three months. The brave Thambi Naidoo is also in gaol. Mr. Vyas was arrested yesterday. He has been released on bail because he has to meet perhaps a dying brother who is dangerously ill. His case is adjourned for a fortnight. Mr. Nadeshir Cama, who was to have proceeded to India if duly elected by this meeting, has also been arrested, and his case has been adjourned for similar reasons. Our worthy Chairman whose name is included in the Indian deputation, was arrested at 2 o’clock. His case has been remanded in order to enable him to wind up his business, but him also three months imprisonment stares in the face, and Omarji Sale, the Vice-Chairman of the British Indian Association, as also Mr. Dildar Khan has been arrested and they are released on bail, but them also the same punishment awaits. Such are the circumstances under which we have ass-embled here . I do not know what displeasure I have incurred that the Government have not arrested me yet, but I  do declare that if this meeting chooses to pass the resolution with reference to the English deputation, the Government will find me
 
 gone on Monday next, unless they choose to extend [me] the hospitality in the Transvaal as they have done before now. My friends, the men who have gone to gaol to-day have left fami-lies behind them. I had the misfortune to see a weeping wife last evening but the last word that she told me was, “Whether I weep or do not weep, you will see that my husband will do his duty, and suffer imprisonment for the fifth time.” It only remains for this meeting to say what the rema-
 ining Indians are capable of doing. I am fully aware that all the members of the community are not capable of undergoing the same measure of suf-fering, but, if you cannot do that, you can certainly help those who have now gone to gaol and can help the cause by showing your sympathy in many other respects, and I do hope that this meeting will not fail in its duty.

         TO  THE 	EDITOR 	THE STAR JOHANNESBURG SIR,        JOHANNESBURG,  June 	18, 1909 
  	You have always generously opened your  columns to a discussion of 	public questions, whether your views coincided with those of your 	correspondents or not. I know you will extend that generosity to 	those who are engaged in the Asiatic struggle, until,in the fulness 	of time, it is over, but I trust that you will see your way to give 	your opinion of the latest phase of it.  	The   Chairman   of    the    British    Indian    mass    meetinglibtech_677_footnoteof Wednesday telegraphed the purport of the 	resolutions passed at that meeting to the Honourable the Colonial 	Secretary, requesting suspension of the sentences passed upon and 	the abjourned cases of those who have been elected as delegates 	composing the English and Indian deputations. The following is the 	Colonial Secretary’s reply:  With 	reference to 	your telegram 	this morning, 	the Colonial 	Secretary desires me 	to state that when 	instructions were given for 	the arrest of 	the persons 	you name, 	for non-compliance with 	the registration 	provisions of the 	law, nothing was 	known of 	the likelihood 	of their 	being selected as 	delegates. While anxious 	not to 	interfere in 	any way with the freedom 	of action 	of members 	of the 	deputation,he regrets it 	is impossible 	for him to 	comply with 	your request and 	interfere with 	the course of 	the law.     
 The public do not know that the Government have dotted the Colony with their spies, who watch the movements of those who are actively engaged in the struggle. They have sent to them the reports of every meeting, public or private, that is held by British Indians. The names of the members who were elected last Wednesday have been before the Government for some time. The names of the delegates were finally fixed at a committee meeting last Sunday, which was attended by nearly three hundred Indians. The Press came to know of this appointment, and an inquiry was made at the offices of the Association on Monday. The names were published on Tuesday in the local Press. The four delegates,Messrs Cachalia, Coovadia, Cama and Chettiar were arrested on Wednesday. It is impossible therefore to believe that the Government knew nothing as to the selection of these delegates. The text of the Colonial Secretary’s telegram, in the light of the facts given above, is quite clear. When he says “nothing was known of the likelihood of their being selected as delegates”, he simply means that the mass meeting had not yet passed them, and he did not know whether it would confirm the nomination of the committee referred to above. One is justified in concluding that the Government did know that those names were to be submitted to the mass meeting, and that the nomination of three hundred Indians was not likely to be overridden by the mass meeting. Why did not the Government stop proceedings, or wait until the decision of the mass meeting was known? Every Indian believes that the Government intended that, at the time of discussing the South African Draft Act in London, there should be no Indian deputation; that they, by striking terror, into the hearts of British Indians, wished to make the mass meeting a fiasco, and that they have left free the remaining members of the deputation only because they got frightened of themselves. Not only have they arrested four of the Indian delegates out of seven, but they have also picked out some of the best workers and the staunchest men among the Indian community, making a total of seventeen men. Some of these have passed through the gaols of the Colony more than four times, are married, and have left behind them weeping wives and children. The refusal to suspend the sentences or the cases of the delegates is as heartless as the proceedings which were taken with such suddenness and in violation of the ordinary rules of fair play and decency.
 My countrymen consider that Sir George Farrar, Sir Percy Fitzpatrick and other members of the Progressive Party are just as
 responsible for the savage action as Generals Botha and Smuts. They, however, act in the name of the electors. I ask them, and I ask you, as representing the Press, and also as an elector,whether you and they, who are about to receive a liberal Constitution, will use the power which will be shortly given to you and to them in prosecuting men who are fellow-subjects with you and them, but who happen to wear a brown skin. Apart from the merits of the case, is it too much for the public to demand from the Government a release of the  chosen leaders of the Indian people under the security offered?
 I am, etc.,

 "
225,,DEPUTATION,"
  
 The decision of the Transvaal Indians to send a deputation is a very important move. The significant thing is that it has been decided so send a deputation consisting of satyagrahis. It appears somewhat incongruous that those who have been defying laws should go to England to seek redress. Hence, one can understand why there was a difference of opinion on this point.
 This deputation cannot be defended as being consistent with the principles of satyagraha. Satyagrahis must only suffer. They should depend on God alone. A satyagrahi’s success consists in the very fact of his offering satyagraha. But all satyagrahis do not have the same spirit and the same trust in God. Moreover, many Indians have not been able to continue satyagraha. They are nonetheless with the satyagrahis. They want our struggle to come to an early conclusion. So long as Mr. Dawad Mahomed, Mr. Rustomjee and others are in gaol, they cannot rest in peace. The satyagrahis who have  been released must also have something to do. The Government will not re- arrest them immediately. What, then, should they do?  Thus  considered, the deputation idea appears justified.
 Sending deputations to both countrieslibtech_678_footnotecannot but bring some benefit. Our struggle is not properly understood either in England or in India. If it can be properly explained in both the countries, that by itself will surely mean much. It will lead to increased help from both
 
 countries, and to that extent the duration of the struggle may be shortened.
 Moreover, since this movement is cited as a model, it is our duty to see that it is fully understood in India. From this point of view also, the idea of a deputation appears to be justified.
 The deputation to India will prove immensely helpful to that going to England. It will compel even Lord Crewe to think, and force Lord Morley to realize his duty.
 It is our view that the right persons have been elected  as  members of the deputation. It was a great thing that Mr. Hajee Habib declared himself ready to join satyagraha. Some members of the community had lost courage because of his having withdrawn from the struggle. Now that he has decided to throw in his weight, that may revive the strength of the other Indians too. Be that as it may, it was a matter of regret for many Indians that Mr. Hajee Habib, who had served the community over many years, had shown himself weak. Now that he is in full form again, the community feels happy. We pray to God to give him sufficient strength to carry on to the end, and to welcome imprisonment cheerfully should the need arise. About Mr. Cachalia, who is a member of the deputation, there is no need at all to say anything. The fact that there are Tamil members on both the deputations does honour to that community. The Tamils’ performance has been so very good that no deputation can proceed unless they are represented on it.
 The community is not unaware of the valuable services of Mr. Cama. Much work, indeed, awaits him in India, and there is no doubt that he will acquit himself well. It reflects credit on the community that it has thought of sending Mr. Polak to India. His services have not yet been fully appreciated by it. They will be—in due time. Mr. Polak’s visit to India will open India’s eyes somewhat. By sending him we can also prove that the Coloureds and the whites can work together and that, in the present circumstances, India can make better progress with the help of whites. One should know how to utilize such help.
 After saying this about the deputation, we must ask the community not to build high hopes on it. It is on pure satyagraha that we should really depend. The sending of the deputation does not imply the end of satyagraha. It must continue. We hope that by the time the deputation reaches [its destination], quite a number of
 Indians will have gone to gaol. The deputation’s task is difficult and, should it return empty-handed, we must find comfort in the thought that the effort had been worth making.
 The deputation will have some weight only if the community discharges its duty during the time that it is away. Meetings must be held all over South Africa to express support. The resolutions [passed in these meetings] should be forwarded directly to Lord Crewe.
 Since this article was written, the Government has arrested some prominent Indian leaders, among them members of the deputation. Consequently, it appears likely that the struggle will be only intensified right here.

TO
ALL TRANSVAAL INDIANS
 I am also going as a member of the deputation to England. Two of the four delegates have already been arrested, and are now installed in gaol. Other Indians, too, who have suffered many a wound, have been arrested again. I do not at all like going to England in these circumstances. However, it is the opinion of all our European friends that I should go; the community desires it; the Committee in England is of the same opinion. I am therefore going along with Mr. Hajee Habib. But there is no guarantee that by going to England we shall succeed in getting our demands accepted—demands whose rejection has led already to hundreds of Indians going to gaol. It may also happen that Lord Crewe will refuse to receive the deputation, saying that he cannot meet men who have been defying the law. Those who are sending the deputation must realize that in sending a deputation, which will be in England at a time when all statesmen of South Africa will have assembled there, so that we may have no regrets later, we are
 
 only making an experiment. It will be wrong to build any hopes on it.
 There is only one unfailing remedy—going to gaol. Even if a few Indians keep on going to gaol from time to time, we are bound to get in the end what we want. We shall get it even if there should be only one such Indian to fight to the last.
 This is a war between truth and falsehood. Since truth is on the side of the Indian community, it must winlibtech_680_footnote. It is the duty of every Indian to assist the deputation. There are some Indians who are bent upon creating dissension in the community. The Government has its spies among Indians. Efforts are continually made to mislead the Indian community through them. These efforts will be intensified during the visit of the deputation to England. It is the duty of every Indian to counteract all these. Those who are not strong enough for the hardships of gaol must keep at home. If one is approached for one’s signature on any document, it should not be given without thorough inquiry.
 It is necessary that meetings are held at every place to extend support to the deputation. Such meetings should not be confined to the Transvaal, but must be held all over South Africa. It should also be remembered that this deputation is not going on behalf of the satyagrahis. They put their faith in nothing but the truth. For them following truth is itself a victory. The deputation is going rather out of regard for the sentiments of those who have not been able to hold out till the last and, if possible, with a view to lightening the burden on the satyagrahis. The latter, therefore, need not pay any attention to the deputation. When the force of their truth grows stronger than the falsehood of the Transvaal Government, their trials will come to an end as a matter of course. Remembering this, the satyagrahi must continue to seek opportunities for imprisonment.

 [Before June 21, 1909]
 BRITISH INDIAN CONCILIATION COMMITTEE
 A deputation of this Committee, consisting of Messrs Abdool Ganie, Hajee Ojer Ally, Habib Motan, S. V. Thomas, Ally Khamisa, Jusab Ebrahim Gardi and George Godfrey, waited on General Smuts at 12 o’clock on Saturday. General Smuts gave nearly half an hour to the Committee. It submitted the following demands:
 That the obnoxious Act be repealed, that the educated [Indians] be granted the same rights of immigration as the whites, that, in case there are more partners than one [in a firm], all the partners should not be required to be present when applying for a licence, that educated persons should not be required to give thumb-impressions, that applications for registration should be permitted from within the Transvaal, that temporary permits should be issued freely, that those who do not hold permits should not be required to adduce proof of three years’ domicile, that there should be provision for an appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of a magistrate, etc.libtech_684_footnote
 I understand that General Smuts has given the following reply to these demands:
 The obnoxious Act will not be repealed, though it will not be enforced; in deserving cases permission will be given to educated men to enter, as in the case of Mr. James Godfrey, but the law will not be amended; if it is true that there is delay in
 
 issuing permits, permission [to enter] will be conveyed by telegram; all the partners of a firm will not be required to attend, and so on.
 A   written   reply   has   been   promised.libtech_685_footnoteThere   will   be    no modification of the provision regarding three years’ residence, since, as General Smuts claims, Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Quinn had agreed to its introduction.
 If this is the whole of the reply, I must say that it takes us now- here. This is only a repetition of what happened in 1907. General Smuts has refused to make any concessions on essential points, and offered tri-vial ones which it did not require a deputation to secure. It will hardly be necessary even to amend the Regulations in order to effect the changes [he has offered to make].
 The Conciliation Committee was set up only with one object, namely, to secure the release of the Indian prisoners still serving their terms of imprisonment. This can be brought about only through the repeal of the obnoxious Act. That General Smuts has declined to con- sider. Conciliation means peace. Since this has not been secured, I for one would advise that the Committee be dissolved. It has become super-fluous, as it has no more work to do. Those who are anxious to hasten the end of the struggle but cannot bring themselves to court arrest should patiently help those who are in gaol. They can do this by contributing to funds and extending their support by holding meetings. Those who have joined the Committee in the hope of doing some good to the community should be careful that they do not, on the contrary, harm it.
 Many persons seem to think that the provision regarding three years [domicile] introduced in the new law [of 1908] makes the position much worse than it was under the obnoxious Act [of 1907]. This is a misapprehension. Under the latter, those who held permits were alone eligible for registration. Whether or not others should be registered was entirely within the discretion of the Registrar. Under the new law, the right granted to those with three years’ domicile is an additional provision. Why it should be three years and not two and why there should be any time-limit at all are separate questions. The
 
 
 point was included in the Association’s petition.libtech_686_footnotelibtech_687_footnoteBut the point to be noted is that, under the obnoxious Act, the rights of pre-war residents of the Transvaal were liquidated entirely, while the new law recognizes the rights of those with three years’ domicile. Of course, we must ask for as many more rights as possible. But such rights cannot be secured as long as the basic demand has not been conceded. If our  two demands are accepted, it will be easy to secure the rest. It should also be remembered that, if the obnoxious Act did in fact recognize the rights of Indians with pre-war residence, that Act is still on the Statute- book. Why is it that such Indians are not able to come in under that Act? If it is true that their rights are implied in that Act, we can as well fight to avail ourselves of them as long as the Act is in force. But anyone who looks into the Act will see that it recognizes no such rights.
 Personally, I would advise those who are out to secure miscellaneous concessions to remember that, if the trunk is cut off, the branches will wither away as a matter of course, and hence they should apply themselves to the task of felling the trunk.
 ARRESTS
 I think the community’s fortunes are taking a turn  for  the better. It is a matter for congratulation that gaols are being filled just when the deputation is about to proceed. Other Tamils, listed below, were arrested on Thursday:
 Messrs N. K. Peter, Rome John, Moses  Anthony, David Anthony, Gabriel Anthony, Peter Anthony, Harry Tamabrahm, Edward Varmale, S. Chetty, Chhana, Bhikha Kasan, Veerdoo, J. M. S. Cook, Raja Francis, K. Subia Naidoo, Pana Padiachy, Perumal Naidoo,
 B. Krishnasamy Naidoo, V. Mathurasamy Padiachy, V. N. Peter, Sami Nathan, Sahala Padiachy, V. Naidoo, P. Chetty, M. P. Padiachy, V. Mootia Naidoo, N Gopal, R. K. Padiachy, N. Chetty, S. Chetty, G. Padiachy, S. P. Naidoo and Appu Chetty.
 The list includes Mr. Gopal also. On Friday, forty-one more were arrested, all of them Tamils. When twenty-one were arrested, the remain-ing Tamils informed the police that they too would welcome arrest. There are now hardly and Tamils left in the Pretoria Location. At the trial, it was suggested that the cases might be adjourned. In agreeing to the adjournment, the Public Prosecutor demanded bail
 
 amounts to be fixed, in reply to which Major Dixon [the Magistrate] remarked that there was no question of bail in the case of satyagrahis, for the Government itself wanted them to run away. This shows that wherever Indians are arrested in numbers, it is the Government that is likely to grow weary of the business.
 GOVERNMENT LIE
 
 In accordance with the resolution passed at the mass meeting on Wednesday, a telegramlibtech_688_footnotelibtech_689_footnotewas sent to the Government in the name of the Chairman asking it to release the members of the deputation who had been arrested, so that they might be able to join the deputation, and stat-ing that the community was prepared to stand security for their return. General Smuts immediately replied to the telegram, saying that, when instructions were given for their arrest, nothing was known of the like-lihood of their being selected as delegates. This is absolute falsehood. The Government is always posted with full information about saty-agrahis’ movements and Indian meetings. It is obviously the intention of the Government to make it impossible for the deputation to leave. If Mr. Gandhi has not been arrested, it is only out of fear. And Mr. Hajee Habib has been spared because he has joined satyagraha only recently.
 However, when the party that is in the wrong tries to harass the one that is in the right, it only succeeds in serving the interests of the latter. Everyone says that General Smuts has made a big mistake in arresting members of the deputation. The community has refused to elect alter-native members. Therefore, from our point of view, the imprisonment of those who have been elected is as good as their joining the deputation. Their places [as members of the deputation] will not be filled by any other Indians, but will remain vacant instead.  I rather wish that Mr. Gandhi too were arrested. That would have straightaway exposed the intentions of the Government.

382	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI
 
 AID TO PRISONERS
 The families of some of the Tamils who have been arrested are left without any means of maintenance. Arrangements have  been made for such families. This burden should be borne by the Pretoria businessmen, and I hope that it will not fall on the Association. More than £12 have been spent in providing maintenance to the families of the Tamils who went to gaol on the last occasion, and the expenditure had to be borne by the Association. Such expenses continue to be incurred from time to time, and, therefore, everyone who can afford should come forward with financial assistance.
 While on this subject, I remember that the Rev. Mr. Howard gave one pound to the Association, though he is a poor man. An Indian youth went to the Association’s office last week and offered £ 3. It was with great difficulty that he could be made to give his name, and that, too, he did on condition that it should not be published. Hence, I do not give the young man’s name. Such examples deserve to be emulated.
 SHELAT’S CASE
 Mr. Shelat’s  arrest  has  already  been  reported.libtech_690_footnoteHis  case  was heard in the Magistrate’s chambers. At first, the Magistrate signed a blank warrant for his deportation. In other words, it was not specified in the warrant at what point he was to be deported. Subsequently, Mr. Gandhi approached the Magistrate and submitted to him that he had no authority to put his signature on a blank warrant for deportation. It was then ordered that Mr. Shelat be put across the Natal border. Afterwards, he was taken to Pretoria. There, Mr. Chamney tried to persuade him to apply for registration. Mr. Shelat gave a blunt refusal and displayed great courage.
 JAMES GODFREY
 I have referred above to the dispatch of a permit to Mr. James Godfrey. I am sorry that, while the struggle was in full swing, he applied for a permit and had it sent to him and that he proposes to submit to the Act. I hope that he will do nothing of the kind.

 Here 	is my reply to your letter dated 17th June:libtech_691_footnote  	I do not know exactly what the demands of the Muslim League are, for 	I was in gaol at the time, and I have not yet acquainted myself with 	what happened during my imprisonment. I think it reasonable that a 	Muslim should be appointed to the Viceroy’s Council. If Lord 	Morley has ordered such an appointment, I think he is justified. I 	make no distinction between Hindus and Muslims. To me both are sons 	of Mother India. My personal view is that, since numerically Hindus 	are in a great majority, and are, as they themselves believe, 	better-placed education-ally, they should cheerfully concede to 	their Muslim brethren the utmost they can. As a satyagrahi, I am 	emphatically of the view that the Hindus should give to the Muslims 	whatever they ask for, and willingly accept whatever sacrifice this 	may involve. Unity will be brought about only through such mutual 	generosity. If Hindus and Muslims observe, in their dealings with 	one another, the same principles that govern the relations of blood- 	brothers, there will be unbroken harmony [between the two 	communities], and then alone will India prosper.

 [CAPE TOWN,
 June 23, 1909]
 [GANDHIJI:] We are going to England particularly in connection with the Asiatic struggle which has been going on in the Transvaal. We consider this a most suitable opportunity for placing the whole of the situation before the Imperial Government and the British public. We also feel that this is essentially a matter in which mutual personal discussion can do a great deal.
 [REPORTER:] Will you act in any way with the Native  and  Coloured deputations which are also proceeding to England?
 It all depends, what opportunity offers itself, and in this connection we shall naturally be very largely guided by Lord Ampthill’slibtech_697_footnoteCommittee in London.
 What is your particular objection to the Act of Union?
 Personally, I have no fault to find with the Constitution if the full liberties of British Indian subjects who are domiciled in South Africa are guaranteed. I hold that Union should not be merely  a union of the white British subjects, but of all British subjects who are domiciled here. The great fear of British Indians is that under the Constitution, It will be a union of white races against British Indians

 and the Coloured races,libtech_698_footnote
 and if that happens, I think it will be a most unfortunate thing in every way, and it will be the duty of the British Indian deputation to leave no stone unturned to guard against any such Imperial calamity.
 How about the restriction of the franchise in the Transvaal?
 Personally, I am not laying any great deal of stress on the matter of the franchise. What I am now thinking of is the genesis of  a situation which is undoubtedly against the Coloured races of South Africa. I have studied all that has been said about it; I have studied the Parliamentary discussions, and all these undoubtedly go to show that Union spells, perhaps, ruin to the Coloured races, especially the Asiatics, unless the Imperial Government obtained full guarantees with regard to these matters.
 In what respect will they be worse off under Union?
 In this way, for the simple reason that the Union Parliament will speak with the united voice of South Africa, and the Imperial Government would be very slow to object to any legislation passed by the Union Parliament. As it is, each individual Colony brings such tremendous power to bear upon the English Government that  the latter rarely exercises its right of veto in connection with measures affecting the Coloured population and it would be still less inclined to do so when that legislation came with the sanction of a Union Parliament of South Africa.
 Mr. Gandhi, who expects to be absent about three months, also referred to the arrest of Indians in the Transvaal, and said that he himself hardly expected to be allowed to cruss the border without arrest, but no obstacle was placed in his way. He arrived here by the mail train a couple of hours or so before the steamer left.

  "
233,"June 23, 1909",DEPUTATION’S VOYAGE [–I],"
  
 [ After June 23, 1909]
 A COMPARISON
 When the Indian community sent a deputation to England in October 1906, the circumstances were different from what they are today.
 In 1906, the Indian community had pledged itself to go to gaol, but no one was sure who would do so if there was no redress from the Government. Now we know of men who are saturated with [love of] gaol. In 1906, the Indian community did not realize its own latent strength. This time the whole world knows about it.
 Nevertheless, the deputation’s task in 1906 was comparatively easy. It is difficult this time. We have to secure the repeal of an Act which has already been sanctioned. In 1906, we did not know the Imperial Government’s attitude. This time it has indicated this. Even then the deputation is proceeding, unconcerned. For we are to a great extent indifferent to what will happen in England. It is with our tried weapon of satyagraha that we are to fight.
 PREPARATIONS
 Preparations for the deputation had been under way for several days past. But the community is faced with a situation so difficult that till the very last day it was not certain whether the deputation would proceed or not. Sufficient funds had not been collected either. The tickets for the voyage were bought at eleven in the morning of the very day of departure (Monday, June 21). Even after that, it was not certain that it would leave. The Government was free, if it chose, to arrest the other members of the deputation. Some thought that the arrests might take place even as the members were about to board the train. All the same, the deputation started on its way. But it  is mutilated, having lost one of its legs. Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Chettiar are the deputation’s right leg. Both these friends are in gaol, while we two, Mr. Hajee Habib and I, are proceeding. Neither of us is happy over this. But I am sure that Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Chettiar will speak for us more eloquently from gaol than they could have done in England. They will be happier in gaol than we on our journey, though travelling first-class. A satyagrahi cannot even conceive otherwise. My
 own experience proves the same thing, as I shall show more clearly afterwards.
 AT THE STATION
 Park Station was crowded with Indians. About 500 Indians must have assembled. Mr. Aswat and Mr. Nagadi, who had gone  to Krugers- dorp to raise funds, had managed to reach the station. The police had made special arrangements. They were not seen shoving the people about. A number of Indians were made to stand quite at the back. There were many who had brought bouquets and garlands. This at least could be observed, that every face was lit up with the hope that the deputation might meet with success. Mr. Kallenbach, his partner Mr. Kennedy, Mr. MacIntyre, Miss Olive Doke, Miss Schlesin and Mr. Polak were also there. The train started exactly at 6-15 p.m.
 ON THE WAY
 At Vereeniging, almost the whole of the local Indian community had turned up at the station. They greeted the deputation with great warmth. They had brought for us a basketful of fruit, which is still not exhausted. Mr. Haffejee gave us a bottle of Indian scent.
 At Worcester Station, there were many Indians who had come all the way from Robertson. They too had brought flowers and fruit. In Robertson, the Indian population consists mainly of Tamils. At Worce-ster, therefore, it was mainly the South Indian friends who were present.
 On the way, Mr. Hajee Habib suffered from some infection in the left eye. It has been with him from before he left Johannesburg. The eye was a violent red and watered profusely. A wash with hot saline water gave him relief, but not much. We have had to consult the physician on board the ship. Even at the moment of writing, the pain has not subsided completely, though there is considerable relief. I put eye-drops every day twice or thrice, in addition to which ice-cold compresses are also being applied. The physician is very solicitous.
 IN CAPE TOWN
 The train reached Cape Town half an hour late. There were a few Indians at the station. The rest came on board the ship to meet us. A fare-well dinner had been arranged in honour of Mr. Anglia, who was leaving for Durban the same day. Many Indians were busy with the function. Here, too, the Indian community gave us a send-off with
 fruit and flowers.
 Mrs. Olive Schreiner, a prominent South African lady, and Mrs. Lewis came on board the ship specially to shake hands with us. Both the ladies appeared to have great sympathy for our cause. We saw that the satyagraha movement had won a place in their hearts.
 CABLES RECEIVED ON STEAMER
 Mr. Cachalia’s cable is a rousing and stirring call to the deputation to do its duty. It reads as follows:
 Happy to know both going. Suffering in gaol for country’s sake preferable to going with you. Wish you success.
 Mr. Ebrahim Coovadia sent the following telegram at the time of his arrest:
 On way to gaol, wish the deputation success. Can serve the community best through gaol.
 I am touched to the quick as I translate these two telegrams. There can be nothing but empty bubbles where we are going. But those who are in gaol at the moment are assuredly serving the community. I am convinced that whatever the deputation may be able to achieve will be nothing as compared to the value of their service. Mr. Cachalia, Mr. Coovadia and other prisoners demonstrate the new spirit of the Indian community. The deputation only shows Indians’ weakness. The prisoners prove to the world that the Indians have grown to be men. The deputation only proves that they are no quite men still, that as yet they are children who need the deputation to lean on, as a child needs the support of a  chalan-gadilibtech_699_footnotelibtech_700_footnote. The prisoners are the strong limb of the Indian community, while the deputation is the debilitated one. Those who have gone to gaol have nothing to be disappointed about. Those who have pinned their hopes on the deputation will be disappointed, if it returns empty-handed. Therefore,  I would advise everyone to expect nothing from the deputation. Help it—by going to gaol, by maintaining unity, by sending cables and by remaining strong there. Think of the deputation as a steam engine. Steam will be produced and the engine will move only if the coal needed for the purpose is supplied from there. The motive power lies [with you] there; the motion of the engine is but a visible manifestation [of that motive power]. This point must never be lost sight of. And so, the other telegrams that we received have also proved
 
 
 a source of encouragement to us.
The Hamidia Islamic Society cables:
 Good wishes of the faithful go with you. Trust you to uphold faith, honour and manliness. Will do our best to secure support for you here and in India.
 The Imam Sahib has sent a separate cable to say: Will keep the flag flying. Wish you success.
 The following telegram was received from the Potchefstroom Committee:
 Support your mission. Wish you success. Robertson Indians sent this telegram:
 Wish you a happy voyage. Pray God crown your mission with success.
We left Cape Town fortified by these good wishes.
 “DO SOMETHING REGARDING UNION”
 Many Indian friends have urged the deputation not to forget the question of the Union. I must say that this request proceeds from igno-rance as to the implications of a Union, and so I shall make a few obser-vations on it here. On the ship, I have been able to give further thought to the subject, and discuss it [with others]. The Union Bill makes no refe-rence to us at all. The Act will unite all the Colonies. But the respective laws of the Colonies will remain intact. What can we say against this? We can do or say nothing against a Union of the Colonies of South Africa. If, after the Union is formed, they attempt any legislation against us, we can fight out the question then. Our rights will not be liquidated by the mere formation of the Union. No doubt, that will be one of the consequences of the Union. But we cannot oppose a Union merely on the ground that we might be ruined under it. The main point is that even the white population of the Colonies acts as our enemy. When the enemies are united, they are bound to increase their pressure [on us]. What can be done about this? We certainly can-not prevent them from being united.
 No one comes forward to say that, as our enemies are uniting, so must we, the Indians. That is the real solution. Ignoring that, Indians have been begging for something to be brought to  them  from England [as a gift]. This shows our utter helplessness. The whites of the Colonies are the strong and favoured sons [of the Empire]. We are the weak and neglected ones. How can the neglected sons get a
 hearing from the mother against the favoured ones? By petitioning? It is impossible. A petition can help us only when it is in the form of a command, which it will be when it has some sanction behind it. A petition should be taken to mean a polite command. Sanctions are of two kinds: one, physical force, and two, soul force— satyagraha. Physical force is nothing compared to the power of truth. If we cultivate this, we shall cease begging for something to be done about the Union.
 Dr. Abdurrahmanlibtech_701_footnoteis going to England entirely in connection with the question of the Union, and that is justified. For, under the Union Act, some of the rights of the black races will be abrogated right now. In such a contingency, an efffort must be made [to prevent this]. It is not the same with us. However, no one should suppose that the deputation will not raise the subject at all. It cannot but do so. It is because negotiations for a Union are in progress that the deputation is going. It will, moreover, urge in no uncertain terms that the Union should not be permitted if the Transvaal grievances are not redressed. And I say further that, if the Indians act with all their strength, the deputation cannot but gain its point. It will also raise the subject of the laws that have been enacted in the whole of South Africa. This does not mean that these laws will be repealed. Their repeal can be achieved only through satyagraha. But we may hope that discussion [of the question] will impe! the Imperial Government to seek an understanding from the Colonial Government. I presume that this clarification will satisfy all Indians. Everyone who reflects on this question will realize that the deputation will, of course, do all it can regarding the Union. This is a question involving legal subt-leties. How can they be fully understood without knowledge of the law?
 FELLOW-PASSENGERS
 With us are Mr. Merrimanlibtech_702_footnote, Prime Minister of Cape Colony, and Mr. Sauerlibtech_703_footnote. From Natal, there are Mr. Smythe and Mr. Green. From the Orange River Colony, there is Mr. Botha. The names of other English passengers need not be given.
 
 
 The deputation of the “Coloured people” is also sailing by this very ship. It consists of Dr. Abdurrahman,  Mr. Frederick,  Mr. Londors and Mr. Mavela. I am sorry to say that Dr. Abdurrahman and two of his companions are travelling second-class and Mr. Mavela third. This reflec-ts on the dignity of the deputation. It does not seem proper that they should travel in these conditions as representatives of the Coloured peo-ple. I see some worthless whites travelling first-class, while these repre-sentatives [of the Coloured people] are in the second and third classes. On inquiry I learn that the deputation is travelling thus because it was short of funds. Two more members of the deputation will follow by the next ship. Dr. Abdurrahman has told me some remarkable things about Mr. Schreiner, who has gone ahead on their behalf. Not only has Mr. Sch-reiner put their  case  strongly before [Cape] Parliament, but he has also gone to England specially to plead on their behalf. He had no other work there. Besides, he has gone at his own expense. He has not taken a farth-ing from the Coloured people. Though he has a lucrative practice at the Bar, he is not a rich man, for he spends a great deal on his large family and on philanthropic activities. He was engaged for over two months in the Dinuzulu case, but he has not received his fee as yet, and he does not care. Here is a lawyer worthy of the name. In former times, this was the attitude of all lawyers. They practised in order to serve others and not for money. What they received in return for their services was called “honorarium”. No suit could lie in  respect  of  such honorarium. Moreover, the fact that Mr. Schreiner is exerting himself so much for the Coloured people shows that there are great and philanthropic whites who include other communities within the scope of their philanthropic activities. It seems to me that we should Judge a community by its good men. Only then can different communities live together.

 "
234,,MR. POLAK AND HIS WORK,"
  
 In view of the departure of Mr. H. S. L. Polak as a delegate on behalf of the Transvaal British Indians to proceed to India, in order to educate public opinion there, and to rouse India to a sense of her duty, our readers will be glad to have a short sketch of Mr. Polak’s life. Mr. Henry Salomon Leon Polak was born just 27 years ago at
 Dover, England, and is the son of Mr. J. H. Polak, J. P., who is a member of the South Africa British Indian Committee in London. Mr. Polak is an undergraduate of London University, and is the holder of many certificates, in literary and economic subjects, issued by the London Chamber of Commerce and other educational bodies. He completed his education at the Ecole de Commerce, Neuchatel, Switzerland, whereafter he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Society of Chemical Industry, in London. For reasons of health, Mr. Polak came to South Africa, in the early part of 1903. Before he became identified with the Indian cause and accepted the editorship of this journal, which was and still is purely a labour of love, he was engaged in journalistic work. Desiring to realise some of his ideals, he left what might be termed a lucrative appointment, with promise of further pecuniary advancement and, in 1904, joined the phoenix scheme, under which the members receive only just enough to support themselves in the simplest manner possible. The scheme, as readers of this journal are aware, is intended to put into practice the essential teaching of Tolstoy and Ruskin, and, in its outward manifestation, to assist in removing the grievances of British Indians in South Africa. Owing to the exigencies of Indian public work in the Transvaal, and in order the better to enable him to carry on his duties in connection with this journal, Mr. Polak took articles with Mr. M. K. Gandhi in the year 1906 and, in 1908, was admitted as Attorney of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal.
 Since the year 1906, he has acted as Assistant Hon. Secretary of the Transvaal British Indian Association—a period that has marked a most critical stage in the history of British Indians in South Africa, and which has demanded from those who, like Mr. Polak, have been intimately connected with the passive resistance movement, the most unremitting zeal and devotion. During the last three years, Mr. Polak has known no rest. He has, besides using his able pen freely for the cause, travelled throughout South Africa, either making collections in aid of the passive resistance struggle, or addressing public meetings and enlightening Indians in different parts of the sub-continent as to the nature of the struggle. His knowledge of the different questions affecting British Indian settlers and Asiatic legislation in South Africa is almost unrivalled. In his eagerness to possess himself with accurate knowledge, he has considered nothing too unimportant to study, and in order to have a proper perspective of the whole situation, during what leisure he has been able to find, he has studied also modern Indian history. Mr. Polak has kept himself in touch with the current
 Indian thought by contributing to several leading newspapers and magazines in India. He, therefore, goes to India by  no  means unknown to the Indian public. The people of India will no doubt be glad to learn that, in order to know the inner side of Indian life and character, throughout his travels in South Africa, Mr. Polak has always lived with Indians in their homes like one of themselves. He has acquired such a hold on their affections that, during the incarceration of the Indian leaders, his advice was eagerly sought and implicitly followed.
 Mr. Polak was married in 1905, and the Indian community in South Africa owes not a little to Mrs. Polak sharing her husband’s self-sacrifice and public spirit. Latterly, she herself has taken up the organising of Indian women’s meetings, and has thrown herself heart and soul into her work. Two children have been born to them in South Africa. Mr. Polak belongs to an ancient Jewish family and, being a member of a race which has undergone much oppression, considers it a privilege to help in alleviating the sufferings of British Indians in South Africa. When he was yet quite a youth, ethics had a fascinating attraction for him. With him religion and ethics are convertible terms. He, therefore, naturally attached himself to  the South Place Ethical Society in London, of which he is still an associate, and it was from an ethical standpoint that he felt himself called upon to take up Indian work.

 [ Before July 9, 1909]
 LIFE ON SHIP AND LIFE IN PRISON: A COMPARISON
 As I have stated already, it is far better to be in prison than travel first-class on a ship. Mr. Bhikhubhai Dayalji Malia is travelling third- class. Both of us see him every day. That has given us  some  experience of what third-class travel means. I am of the opinion that the freedom and comfort available in the third-class are not to be found in the first-class. But even that cannot match what is available in gaol. The servants in a ship are happier—if only they knew it—than the passengers. First-class passengers are looked after by servants as though they were so many babies. There is something to eat every two hours. We cannot even lift a glass of water with our own hands. At the table it is considered beneath one’s dignity to reach out one’s hand for a spoon lying at some distance. Hands must be washed every now and then all through the day, on the ground that they must be kept clean. As for work, they have hardly any, so that they are growing altogether delicate and soft. It vexes me to observe the present state of my hands and compare it with what they were like in gaol. I envy the servants at their work. Here I have neither the peace nor the freedom I enjoyed in gaol. On the contrary, I have to live hedged in on all sides. My prayers here lack the depth, the serenity and concentration they had when I was in gaol.
 I am not writing all this in a frivolous mood, but after deep reflec-tion. I think of these things every day. Whatever I have read and am read-ing I put to the test of experience. I have realized that those who wish to serve God cannot afford to pamper themselves or to run after luxury. Pra-yers do not come easily in an atmosphere of luxuries. Even if we do not ourselves share the luxuries, we cannot escape their natural influence. The energy that we spend in resisting that influence is at the cost of our devo-tional efforts. I am having a personal experience of this at the moment. I do not write this to suggest that I want myself or anyone else to spend all his days in gaol or that I consider travelling by first-class to be wrong always and in all circumstances. I write this only to point out that we would all profit from the kind of simplicity and solitude we find in gaol. I think it is better to travel by third-class than by first-class, except when we need
 certain facilities or when there are some special reasons which make first-class travel necessary. In South Africa, however, there are several reasons why I would prefer Indians to travel first-class or second-class. We must rebut the charge of miserliness that is levelled against us. Moreover, we generally value simplicity in such matters, so that we are not likely to be puffed up with vanity if we travel first or second. For those who have amassed wealth, first- or second-class travel would appear to be necessary even for maintaining their status. All the same, at a time like this when we are engaged in a mighty fight, I would unhesitatingly ask all Indians to take the view that it is better for an Indian to be in gaol rather than be travelling in a class even higher than the first.
 HOW WE LIVE
 I have known Mr. Hajee Habib for the last fifteen years. But I never had any opportunity of living with him as I am doing today. Hajee Saheb is a man of strict religious principles. He keeps  the  namaz hours punctually. He carefully follows the religious injunctions about food and drink. He has often told me that he has no difficulty in doing so on this occasion. He allows me to decide for him the menu for every meal. I know what will prove acceptable to him. In the morning he has porridge, eggs and tea. At noon he has boiled  potatoes, sometimes fish, a vege-table called lettuce, much like the moola, some variety of pudding, fruit and coffee, and in the evening some leafy vegetable, pudding, fruit and coffee, It is  a  constant thought with him how to make the deputation a success, and we frequently come together to apply our minds to the prob-lem. The ghee and pickles given to him [when he started], he has passed on to Mr. Bhikhubhai. The passengers on board the ship seem to think that we are brothers.
 I have, as usual, two meals a day. I avoid pudding as it contains eggs. I also avoid tea and coffee as far as possible, since they are the produce of slave labour. In other respects, my diet is the same as above, except for fish. I am growing more convinced every day, as my body hardens, that I can do with still simpler food. On this voyage I do not feel a craving for delicacies as I did on the previous occasion.
 Most  of  the  day  is  spent  in   reading.   The   statementlibtech_704_footnoteto   be submitted in England has already been drafted, and approved by Mr.
 
 Hajee Habib. He made some suggestions, which have been incor- porated.
 MEETING WITH MERRIMAN
 There have been meetings with some of the whites on board ship. Mr,. Merriman was one of them. From what I gathered about his views in the course of a long discussion with him, I could see that our efforts against the Union were bound to fail. When I pointed out to him that the Transvaal problem did not have much connection with the question of unification, he studied it in greater detail and promised to do his best in regard to it. I found him full of sympathy for the satyagrahi prisoners. There was a meeting with Mr. Jagger also. He too appeared to hold views similar to Mr. Merriman’s. The Union has come to stay. If the Transvaal problem can be  solved  without prejudice to the question of unification, he will also be prepared to help. He was filled with indignation when he was told of the sacrifices of Mr. Cachalia and Mr. Aswat, and he implied by his remarks that the dispute would have been settled by now it the other  Indian businessmen had followed in their footsteps. He was sorry, as well as surprised, to hear that his own firm had acted against Mr. Cachalia.
 When I spoke to these gentlemen about Mr. Dawad Mahomed and Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, they seemed both deeply impressed. They deplored it all and wanted that some kind of solution  should  be  found. When they were told of our demands, both admitted that they were quite reasonable.
 The subject of the Cape Immigration Act was raised with Mr. Jagger. He was surprised to hear that Indians resident in the Cape had to take out temporary permits when leaving it. Had the Cape Indians exerted themselves sufficiently, this clause would not have been retained in the law. It is still their duty to bestir themselves in regard to this. I am sure that most of the Cape members are entirely ignorant of this absurd clause.
 I had also had a meeting with Mr. Sauer, who is a member of the Cape Cabinet. He was full of sympathy and has promised all possible help. He admitted that the demands of a community that undergoes voluntary suffering as we do can hardly be unreasonable and that it was the duty of every liberal-minded person to help that community.
 I regard this also as one of the results of our satyagraha. Men like him would not have cared to listen to us had we not gone to gaol.
 There is, moreover, another white with whom we have had frequent discussions. He is himself a passive resister. He is secretary of some association. According to him, we have far excelled the English  passive resisters in our capacity to suffer. He has promised a letter of recommendation and also other help.
 All these things are a testimony to the success of satyagraha. Everyone is touched by the story of the suffering which satyagraha has entailed. They are all amazed to hear that we have had no redress so far.
 The sympathies of all these men spring from their conviction that our cause is just and that we are sincere. With Mr. Hajee Habib’s help, I have been reading a book named Kasassul Ambia. In it I read how it was commanded of Azazil that should he fail, after 600,000 years of prayers to God, to bow to Him even on a single occasion, all his prayers would be as though they had never been. The point is, first, that it is what we do when we reach the last stage which will provide the test of our sincerity. Secondly, we can make no conditions with God. We must live as He may order us. If, having gone to gaol ten times, we refuse to do so on the eleventh occasion, the ten previous terms of imprisonment will have been in vain and we shall be laughed at.

 July 9, 1909
CHI. MAGANLAL,
 I have written you a letterlibtech_705_footnotefrom Madeira. This  letter  will  be posted tonight. We shall reach London tomorrow; I am writing this without knowing the atmosphere prevailing there.
 It would be nice if a Sanskrit class is started for the elders there. As I go deeper into the subject, I see the necessity for every Hindu to have a knowledge of that language. I am aware that the suggestions I
 
 make one after another increase your burden. But there is no other way. We have lost so much in the past that it will take some time and also a good deal of effort to regain and consolidate it. It has to be done sooner or later. If not in this life, then in the next. So long as the desires are there,we should better have altruistic ones only. From among these sug-gestions, you may act up to those that you can and bear in mind the rest.
Add the following to “Travel Notes”libtech_706_footnotelibtech_707_footnote:
 “I had also had a meeting with Mr. Sauer who is a member of the Cape Cabinet. He was full of sympathy and has promised all possible help.

N. 	4940       [SOUTHAMPTON,  July 	10, 1909]  	Our deputation was to consist of four, but two are now in prison. 	Our movements depend largely upon the advice of Lord Ampthill and 	his Committee. We feel, we must take this opportunity when so many 	South African statesmen are in this country to see whether something 	cannot be done to relieve the very acute suffering which  British 	Indians in the Transvaal have been undergoing for the past two and a 	half years. Our mission does not seriously affect the question of 	unification except that every Indian feels that the Imperial 	Government should take full guarantee regarding the status of 	British     
 Indians in South Africa under the Union. What we are chiefly concerned in is the settlement of outstanding questions between the Transvaal Government and the Indian community which, when boiled down, really means the question of the status of highly cultured Indians, and whether they may or may not enter the Transvaal under the general immigration law of the day. We contend that the present legislation insults the whole of India in that it creates a racial bar for the first time in the his-tory of Colonial legislation, and in order to remove this bar, hundreds of British Indians have suffered imprison- ment. Even to-day some of the best Indians in the Transvaal are in gaol as conscientious objectors.

 [After July 10, 1909]
 
 WE ARRIVE
 I have reported what happened up to the time of our arrival at Madeira. We arrived at Southampton on the 10th. We were met by a Reuter representative.libtech_711_footnoteWe gave him a brief statement of facts, and the report has appeared in most newspapers. We reached London at about
 10.30 a.m. But there was no one at the station. This was quite surprising. After conveying our luggage to Hotel Cecil, we went to see Mr.   Ritch.   We  found   him   with  Abdul   Caadirlibtech_712_footnotelibtech_713_footnote.   They   were  both surprised. In the absence of any cable, Mr. Ritch had given up hopes of our arrival. What happened was that Reuter had cabled the news [about the deputation] from Johannesburg and it was expected to be published in the newspapers; hence no separate cable was sent to Mr. Ritch. Newspapers nowadays rarely publish Reuter cables on the Transvaal. The cable about the deputation having left was not published. The cable reporting the arrests of the delegates was [however] published. Mr. Ritch concluded from this that the idea of sending a deputation must have been given up for the moment. No one, therefore, expected our arrival.
 WE SET TO WORK
 Soon after we had seen Mr. Ritch, we set to work the moment we had had our lunch. We, the two brothers, accompanied by Mr. Abdul Caadir, Mr. Ritch and Mr. Hussain Dawad, who had run up to Mr. Ritch’s office, called on Mr. Bhownaggree. After consulting among our-selves there, we wrote to Lord Ampthill, and so the round of interviews began. The whole day is taken up in interviewing people and writing let-ters, and we have to keep working even at night. Being free, Miss Polaklibtech_714_footnotehas been entrusted with typing work. She works very
 
 hard, regardless of the hour of the day or night. She also appears to have a good temper.
 We have met Lord Ampthill, Sir Richard Solomonlibtech_715_footnoteMiss Winter- bottomlibtech_716_footnoteMr. Surendranath Banerjealibtech_717_footnoteMr. Cottonlibtech_718_footnoteMr. Justice Ameer Alilibtech_719_footnoteDr.  Abdool  Majid,  Mr.  Azad  and  others.  We  have   also   had interviews with Sir William Lee-Warnerlibtech_720_footnotea member of India Office, and Mr. Morisonlibtech_721_footnoteI am not in a position to give more information just yet. Private consultations are going on. They give some hopes. If they lead to nothing, there is little possibility of our achieving anything through other channels. Lord Ampthill is considering, besides, whether a deputation should be led at all, and whether it will be of any—benefit.
 I have been able to see that everyone approves of our having courted imprisonment and that, if anything counts, it is the fact that so many Indians have gone and are still going to gaol.
 We are deliberately refraining from giving any information to newspapers for the present. It is Lord Ampthill’s advice  that  we should not.
 This is a very bad time to seek interviews with public figures here. Everyone is out of town on a holiday, so that we are not likely to get help from many people. Moreover, the British people are preoccupied with their own affairs. The new budget has raised a storm in Parliament. Also, the visit of South African statesmen makes a heavy demand on [people’s] time. Considering all this and looking at the circumstances around us, I am inclined to believe that, should the private moves that are under way at present fail, nothing is likely to be achieved by our visit.
 
 FIRST SACRIFICE
 There have been a large number of cables about meetings in South Africa. This is something to be happy about. There is not a single cable from Natal. Mr. Nagappen’s martyrdomlibtech_722_footnotelibtech_723_footnotehas made Mr. Hajee Habib and me very unhappy. This has been, even otherwise, a time of mourning for us, and it is all the more so now. However, there is no reason to be sad if we think of the community. We have known all along that we may have to make any sacrifice, including that of life, and that, too, cheerfully. This is exactly what we have to learn in this fight, that in the interest of the community we must bear every kind of suffering, and that only by doing so can we find a solution to our problems. As I get more experience here, I gradually come to see that the deputation which has been sent represents only our weakness. The energy and the time that are spent in seeing various people and in cultivating their goodwill would, if spent merely in suffering, ensure a very early solution. I can make no guess as to the result. But it will be enough if we learn from this struggle the lesson I have indicated above.
 We have also had news of Mr. Dawad Mahomed’s release on account of ill-health. Looking at the matter from his point of view, I feel sorry. But looking at it from the community’s point of view, I congratulate him. We think nothing of inviting illness for ourselves through overindulgence and soft living, or by exerting ourselves overmuch in the pursuit of self-interest. It is, moreover, our own fault that we fall ill in this manner. If, then, anyone falls ill while doing his duty by the community, he surely deserves congratulations on that. That has been so, and will always be so. His example is being followed by Mr. Hussain Mia here. It should make one happy to observe his habits. Besides he has a noble regard for the community.

                    MY 	DEAR HENRY,     WESTMINSTER 	 PALACE HOTEL,  4, VICTORIA STREET, LONDON, S. W., July 14, 1909 
  	You will be agreeably surprised to know that Maud has been assisting 	me and that this letter is being dictated to her. She has been out 	of work now for some time and you can easily imagine my surprise 	when I was told by Paterlibtech_724_footnotethat I could have Maud to assist me. Of course, I was 	naturally very pleased to avail myself of  her assistance; at the 	same time, sorry that she was not working.  She thinks, and I agree, 	that the enforced rest has perhaps done her a little good. It might 	have done her greater good, if she had the capacity for passing the 	time at her disposal as it might have been, but, as she tells me, 	she does not like her own company, which means a great deal. Materlibtech_725_footnoteand   Sallylibtech_726_footnoteare  in  Belgium;  they  return,  I  understand,  	next Sunday. Millielibtech_727_footnotewill 	be here on the 24th. A cablegram was received advising about her 	departure. I saw your cablegram to Mr. Ritch, but the one I am 	referring to was received from Kallenbach yesterday. It also informs 	us of your departure for India.libtech_728_footnote  	This may anticipate you, but the more I think about it, the more  I 	feel and realize that your work over there is far more difficult 	than our work here. The terrible tragedy about Sir Curzon Wyllie and 	Dr. Lalcaca.libtech_729_footnotelibtech_730_footnotecomplicates 	the situation here, but it is nothing compared with the 	complications that must arise there. Please, however, do not worry 	if you do not see the work prospering there under you. You may have 	no meetings and the influential papers there may even         
 boycott you. I do not anticipate any such dire result, but I am quite prepared for it and I should reconcile myself to it in time. All I care about is that you should be able to see most of the leading Anglo- Indians and Indians; that I know you will be able to do, but I am fully aware of the difficulties that beset you, even in this mission of having quiet chats with leaders. You will require all the patience and tact you can command. However, I am not in the slightest degree anxious. I write in this strain only to tell you that I realize your difficulties, and that, therefore, I shall not in any way at all feel disappointed if we do not get much out of the Indian mission. You should confine your attention for the time being to those whose names I have specially given to you, that is, the Editor of The Times of India, Professor Gokhale, Mr. Malbarilibtech_731_footnote.
 The Aga Khan is in London; I have asked for an appointment. We have already seen Justice Ameer Ali. The mission commenced on board. I had a long chat with Mr. Merriman and Mr. Sauer. Both of them were very sympathetic; neither of them knew the situation accurately. Both expressed surprise that our demands, which they considered so reasonable, were not granted. We are, therefore, moving with a view to get together the South African statesmen and see  whether they would not influence General Smuts in the right direction. I am already working under double pressure: have not yet been able to go to bed before one o’clock in the morning, and you know what that means to me. The legacy of a swollen leg, which I inherited from the Pretoria gaol, has not yet left me; this, however, by the way.
 We are meeting Sir Richard Solomon who has given an appoint- ment in response to our letter, as also Lord Ampthill, to-day. In order to give you detailed information, I am dictating this letter in advance, but hope to be able to bring it up to date to-morrow evening (Thursday). Justice Ameer Ali knows Sir Richard personally, and he has also promised to see him and discuss the situation with him. I sent a statementlibtech_732_footnotelibtech_733_footnotewhich he wanted, copy of which I shall keep among the papers to be sent to you.
 Miss Winterbottom is full of the Indian question; she has studied it very accurately. She still continues to read Indian Opinion very
 
 regularly and entertains the same high regard as before. She never wrote againlibtech_734_footnotelibtech_735_footnoteto us, simply because, I fancy, she was too disgusted with the state of things in the Transvaal to trust herself to write calmly. Both Mr. Hajee Habib and I passed nearly an hour with her. She had some other members of her Society to meet us; among them is a lady journalist who appeared to be a very brilliant woman; she is married to a Dutchman who too is a journalist. She told me that she had seen General Botha very often and that she was making a point this time to tackle him on the Indian question. Miss Winterbottom had arranged to go to Cornwall for a change of air which she needs very badly, but she almost feels inclined to abandon her journey for the time being. I have implored her not to cancel her programme and have promised that I would send for her if I considered her presence in London necessary, but she is a woman of extremely high ideas and I could notice yesterday that it was a matter of very prayerful consideration for her whether she would go to Cornwall or not. The one thought that is supreme with her to-day is how she can assist in the struggle. She boiled with indignation when I informed her of poor Nagappen’s death. His picture has been before me ever since the receipt of the cablegram and my work has been more or less mechanical since then. I cannot get him out of my mind; it has affected me very much. However, our attitude must remain unchanged and we have to confirm the advice to the people to face death and worse—if there  were anything worse. I am sending you a copy of that cablegram so that, if you did not know of the news contained therein, the cablegram will supply you with the information.
 Poor Dowd Mahomed must have keenly felt his discharge from the gaol, when Parsee Rustomjee was still in gaol. However, he has returned to Johannesburg, so that he is in the thick of the fight.
 Mr. Abdul Caadir is here. He is often at the hotel but he is not living with us. When the balance of the deputation arrives from Durban, I think all will engage rooms at this hotel.
 Mr. Hajee Habib has been working splendidly. He always keeps me up to the mark and does not let me forget anything at all. We are in perfect harmony. I wortelibtech_736_footnotelibtech_737_footnoteto  you   about  his  eye;  it  caused  him trouble throughout the voyage, but now he is much better, though
 
 there is still a slight inflammation.
 Mrs. Ritch has undergone a third operation, this time at the hands of a very great specialist, Sir Henry Morris; he has been exceedingly kind. I saw her on Sunday and there is every indication of  complete  recovery  in  a   short   time.   Dr.   Oldfieldlibtech_738_footnotehas   entirely fallen—even his supposed surgical skill is now no more. Ritch thinks that he bungled the whole thing and was too cowardly to own up to it. It hurts me to have to write of a man whom I have held in high estimation, but we have often to break our idols. I am only waiting for permission from Ritch, to be able to write to him straight or speak to him, but Mrs. Ritch is averse to any such thing being done until she has completely recovered.
 Dr. Abdurrahman is working [with] might and main. Mr. Schreiner is a wonderful man. He is rendering very great assistance to the Doctor and is not at all without hope. Olive Schreiner and her sister, Mrs. Lewis, both came up to me when I left Cape Town, to shake hands. Dr. Abdurrahman tells me that Mr. Sauer tackled her and she, in her own charming and yet refined manner, told Mr. Sauer that she merely wanted to shake hands with me. She performed this ceremony most heartily in the presence of a huge crowd and both the sisters were quite for a few minutes with us. Fancy the author of “Dreams” paying a tribute to passive resistance, but the whole Schreiner family, from what I have learnt through Dr. Abdurrahman, seems to be perfectly exceptional.
 Cablegramslibtech_739_footnotelibtech_740_footnotesupporting the deputation have been received from Cape Town,	Germiston,	Grahamstown, Kimberley,	Lourenco Marques,	Lichtenburg, Pietersburg,	Port Elizabeth,	Potchefstroom, Rustenburg,	Standerton.

 Mr. Hajee Habib and I had a very long  and  satisfactory interview with Sir Richard Solomon. he went through the whole of the legal aspect, seemed to be very sympathetic; would not commit  himself, but has promised to see Mr. Smuts and do what he can. Then
 
 followed a long interview with Lord Ampthill. Transparent honesty, courtesy and genuine humility were written on his face. He—an ex- Viceroy—did not want to take a single step without our agreeing to its being taken. His object is not in any way to advertise himself by his connection with the Committee, but to serve the cause which he is espousing. He did not know by what right he could ask Mr. Merriman and Mr. Sauer to see him. It seemed to be nothing to him that he has occupied the highest positions in India and occupies a fairly good position in public affairs here. In order that the cause may be served, he is going to see Lord Curzon and get him to take up the matter at the point he left it in South Africalibtech_741_footnote. Thus, you will see, our work will be entirely, for the time being, behind the scenes.
 Sir William Lee-Warner is coming to the hotel to-morrow to see us. Mr. Ameer Ali has undertaken to see Sir Richard Solomon. I had a long chat with Cotton of India yesterday and he has definitely promised to refer to your mission in India in the columns of the ensuing number. I thought that this was necessary in order that the readers of India might realize the situationlibtech_742_footnote.
 I think you had seen Dr. Mehta’slibtech_743_footnoteletter, in which he referred to his impending departure for Europe, taking his son for education. He is now here and staying at the same hotel.
 I forgot, I think, to give you a letter to Mr. Wadia, who you will remember, was going to form in Bombay a Committee in connection with the question. Do not fail to see him at the earliest opportunity.
 If Chhaganlal is there, please show him this letter, as I have no time to write to him at length.
 I have written to several Gujarati men, including Mr. Omer Haji Amod, Mr. Issa Hajee Soomer, Mr. Peerun Mahomed and Mr. M. S. Coovadia.libtech_744_footnote

        DEAR 	MR. MERRIMANlibtech_745_footnote ,      LONDON,  July 	15, 1909 
  	I have taken the liberty of speaking to Lord Ampthilllibtech_746_footnoteregarding the interest you have taken in our 	struggle, and his Lordship has promised to seek an interview with 	you. I hope that something will come out of your private effort. I 	need hardly say that the whole thing has been kept absolutely 	confidential.  	We have just received a cablegram saying that the struggle has taken 	its first victim. A young Indianlibtech_747_footnotelibtech_748_footnotewho 	was serving imprisonment as a passive resister, was discharged in a 	dying condition and died six days after his discharge. There are at 	present about 100 Indians in the Transvaal gaols and during the 	struggle, over 2,500 Indians have  passed through them.  	The question as I have told you, is exceedingly simple. All we want 	is repeal of the Asiatic (Registration) Act, which is  now 	considered no longer necessary by General Smuts: the repeal, placing 	the status of highly educated Indians on a footing of equality under 	the Immigration Law, leaving it open to the administration under the 	education test, to make it so severe as to debar from the Colony 	more than say six persons per year. What we bitterly resent is the 	racial bar, involving as it does a national insult. I 	hope you will not mind my troubling you in this matter.  I 	remain, Yours faithfully,  M. K. GANDHI  J. X.

 PRESENTED BY THE INDIAN DEPUTATION (JULY 1909)
 LONDON,
 July 16, 1909
 APPOINTMENT OF DELEGATES
  A 	mass meeting 	of the 	British Indians of 	the Transvaal 	was held 	on the 	16th June 	last on 	the Hamidia 	Mosque ground 	at Johannes-burg.libtech_750_footnotelibtech_751_footnoteThe  meeting  was  convened  by 	 the  British  Indian 	Association and 	was attended 	by nearly 1,500 Indians. 	The Rev. Canon Berry, the 	Rev. Mr. 	Perry, Mr. 	Kallenbach, Mr. 	and Mrs. Vogl, 	Mr. Dallow, 	and other 	European friends 	were present by 	invitation. Telegrams 	from most 	parts of the 	Transvaal were received from Indian 	Committees approving 	of the 	resolutions that 	were to be submitted to 	the meeting.  Two 	dayslibtech_752_footnotelibtech_753_footnoteprior to the Mass Meeting a meeting of over 300 British 	Indians was held 	on the 	premises of the 	Chairman of the 	Associa-tion, the delegates for 	the Indian 	deputation  finally 	nominated, and 	the names of 	delegates for 	a simultaneous 	Indian deputation discussed.libtech_754_footnote  Of 	late most Indian 	meetings have 	been attended by 	Government detectives.  The 	names of 	the delegates 	to be submitted 	to the mass meeting were published in The Transvaal Leader of the 15th June. 
 
  Of 	these, Mr. 	Amad Mahomed Cachalia, 	Chairman of 	the Association, 	Mr. Ebrahim 	Salooji Coovadia, Acting Chairman of 	the Association, 	Mr. S. S. Chettiar, Chairman of the Tamil Benefit Society, and Mr. 	Nadirshaw Cama, together 	with other prominent Indians, were 	arrested on 	the 15th 	and 16th 	June, for failing 	to comply 	with the 	Asiatic Registration Act.  Messrs 	Cachalia and 	Chettiar were, 	on the 	very day 	of the 	meeting and 	before the 	advertised time, 	sentenced to 	three months’ 	imprisonment with hard 	labour in 	default of 	payment of 	a fine 	of £ 	50.  The 	mass meeting, however, 	took place. The 	following three 	resolutionslibtech_755_footnotelibtech_756_footnotewere submitted there and passed with six dissentients out of 	1,500 people present: 
  This 	mass meeting of 	Transvaal British 	Indians hereby 	confirms the 	appointment made 	by the 	Committee of 	the British 	Indian Association of 	the Transvaal, 	of Messrs 	A. M. 	Cachalia, Hajee Habib, 	V. A. Chettiar 	and M. K. Gandhi 	as a deputation 	to proceed 	to England 	and place 	before the 	authorities and 	the British public 	the true 	situation with regard 	to the 	present Asiatic struggle 	and the British 	Indian view 	of the 	coming Union of 	South Africa. This mass meeting of British Indians hereby elects Messrs N. 
 A. Cama, N. Gopal Naidoo, E. S. Coovadia and H. S. L. Polak as a deputation to proceed to India and  to  place before the authorities and the Indian public  the  true situation with regard to the present Asiatic struggle in the Transvaal.
  This 	meeting respectfully 	protests against the 	sudden and unwarranted 	arrest of Messrs 	Cachalia, Coovadia, Cama and 	Chettiar, who were, as 	the Government well knew, appointed, or 	to be appointed, 	as delegates in  the  	deputations mentioned 	in the 	foregoing resolutions, 	and calls 	upon the Government 	to release 	them in 	order to 	fulfil their 	mission, under 	approved security as 	to their return, 	after completion 	of their 	mission, to 	undergo the 	sentence passed upon 	them by 	the Court. 
 
 
  The 	purport of 	the resolutions 	was telegraphed 	to the Government, to 	which the Government 	replied that they 	had no 	knowledge, at 	the time 	of giving 	instructions for 	the arrests above 	referred to, 	that the delegates 	included in the 	list of the 	Indians to 	be arrested would be elected.  After 	the formal 	election by the 	mass meeting 	and on 	the 17th 	June last, however, Mr. 	Gopal Naidoo, one 	of the 	delegates of 	India, was also 	arrested, together with many other Tamil Indians. Thus, out 	of seven Indian 	delegates (the 	eighth, Mr. 	Polak, being 	an Englishman), 	five were arrested, 	and two only, 	the undersigned, 	were left 	free by the 	authorities to 	proceed on 	their mission. 
 WHO ARE THE DELEGATES?
  Mr. 	Amad Mohamed 	Cachalia is a 	British Indian 	merchant of 	over 18 	years’ standing in 	the Transvaal, 	is married 	and is 	living in 	Johannesburg, together 	with his 	wife and 	children. He 	is one of 	the trustees 	of the 	Pretoria Mosque, as 	also of 	the Hamidia 	Mosque at Johannesburg, 	and of 	the Dabhel 	Madressa Trust. He has 	for the past nine 	months held 	the office 	of Chairman of the 	British Indian 	Association and is 	now, for 	the third time, serving 	imprisonment for 	conscience sake. When he 	found that the 	Government were selling 	the goods 	of Indian 	merchants for 	payment of 	fines imposed under the 	Asiatic Registration 	Act, he felt called upon 	to hand 	over to his  creditors 	the goods 	which were bought 	by him 	on credit. 	 The  creditors, 	however, took a 	political view of 	the step and 	forcibly sequestrated 	his estate, 	although it was 	fully worth 20s 	in the 	£. Mr. 	Cachalia submitted to 	the process, 	and his estate 	has already 	paid his 	creditors in 	full, though a 	forced realization 	has left 	him practically 	penniless.  Mr. 	Chettiar is 	an old man over 	fifty, has 	been settled 	in Johannesburg 	with his family 	for over 	ten years. He 	is a Tamil (Madras) 	leader and is 	now in 	gaol for the second 	time in 	connection with 	the Indian struggle. His 	son, about nineteen 	years old, is 	also in one of the Transvaal gaols in the same cause—for the fifth time.  Mr. 	Hajee Habib migrated to 	South Africa twenty-nine 	years ago, 	and has been 	connected with important Indian businesses. He 	was married 	in the 	Transvaal and 	lives in 	Johannesburg with 	his children. He 	has held 	the office 	of the 	Honorary Secretary of 	the local 	Indian Committee 	at Pretoria 	for the last 	fifteen years and has 	been intimately 	connected with Indian public movements is the Transvaal during the 
 whole of that period. He is permanent Honorary Secretary of the Pretoria Mosque and President of the Pretoria Anjuman Islam. He is a member of that portion of the Indian community which, from the beginning, submitted to the Asiatic Registration Act, after  having vainly attempted to obtain relief from the Government. But its submission was due largely to the inability or unwillingness of the community to undergo the heavy pecuniary losses that were involved in non-submission. His community has, however, never relaxed its efforts, in common with the other Indians, to obtain relief. But Mr. Hajee Habib is unable any longer to enjoy the security of life and property, when hundreds of his countrymen continue for the common good to suffer untold hardships. He has, therefore, bound himself, should the efforts of the deputation fail to secure relief, to throw in his lot with the other sufferers and no longer to make use of  the registration certificate obtained by him. He was the founder and Chairman of the British Indian Conciliation Committee that was  formed during the month of June to intercede between the Govern- ment and the active sufferers. The Committee was intended to bring about conciliation, by affording the Government an opportunity of gracefully conceding the very just demands of the Indian community. A petition was submitted to the Government and a deputation waited upon General Smuts on the 19th June last, but General Smuts stated that he could not grant the Indian prayer on the two main points hereinafter referred to.
  Mr. 	Gandhi, the 	fourth delegate, 	has been 	settled in South 	Africa for 	the last sixteen years, 	is a 	Barrister of 	the Inner 	Temple, Advocate 	of the 	Supreme Court of 	Natal and 	Attorney of 	the Supreme 	Court of the 	Transvaal. He 	has resided 	and practised 	his profession 	in the 	Transvaal since 	1903. He is Honorary 	Secretary of 	the British Indian 	Association of 	the Transvaal 	and has been 	identified with 	the Indian 	public work in 	South Africa 	since 1893. He 	served at 	the time 	of the 	late war as Assistant 	Superintendent of the 	Indian Volunteer 	Ambulance Corpslibtech_757_footnotelibtech_758_footnoteand was mentioned in General Buller’s despatches. He also served with the Indian Stretcher Bearer Corpslibtech_759_footnotelibtech_760_footnoteraised by the Indian 	community at 	the time 	of the 	late Zulu rebellion 	and held 	the rank of Sergeant-Major. He was co-delegate to London with Mr. H. 
 
Stretcher-Bearer Corps”, Before 19-7-1906.
 O. Ally in 1906 in connection with the Transvaal Indian struggle. He has suffered imprisonment three times in this cause. His son is now under-going six months’ imprisonment, although he holds Lord Milner’s certificate and is domiciled in the Transvaal. Mr. Gandhi, Junior, is now serving imprisonment for the third time. After the compromise of January, 1908, hereinafter referred to, whilst Mr. Gandhi was on his way to the Regis-tration Office to fulfil his part of the compact between the Government and the Indian community, he was severely assaulted by some of his countrymen, who distrusted the compromise and resented his action.
  It 	is worthy of 	note that the 	delegation has 	been largely 	insisted upon 	by those 	British Indians who 	hitherto have 	been too 	weak to 	risk pecuniary 	loss and imprisonment, 	and therefore have 	been compelled to 	submit to 	the Asiatic Act, but 	that they 	have volunteered 	to pay 	the out- of-pocket 	expenses of the 	delegates shows 	how keenly 	they desire relief. 
 ABRIEF HISTORY OF THE STRUGGLE
  It 	is generally recognised 	that the 	British Indian position 	before the 	War was better than it 	has been 	at any 	time since, as 	will more fully appear from Note Alibtech_761_footnotelibtech_762_footnote. Since the advent of the British flag in 	the Transvaal, 	it has 	been steadily 	growing worse. Law 	3 of 	1885 (which 	requires every 	Asiatic entering the 	Transvaal to 	pay £ 	3 and 	take out 	a receipt therefor; 	deprives Asiatics of the 	right to 	own landed property, 	save in locations; 	confines their residence to 	such locations; 	and disquali-fies 	them from becoming 	burghers), which was 	accepted by 	the Imperial 	Government under a 	misapprehension and 	when there were only 	about thirty Indians 	resident, was never 	fully enforced by 	the late 	Boer Govern-ment. Indian merchants were not 	interfered with 	in their 	business, and the 	location regulations 	were never 	carried out. Notices 	issued to Indians to remove to locations were, under the advice 	of British Agents, 	ignored or disregarded, 	and under 	the same advice, 	Indian merchants traded 	without licences. They were even arrested for 	so doing, 	but were 	discharged on the 	intervention of 	the British Agent. 	Indian immigration 	was unrestric-ted, 	except that those 	Indians who 	settled in 	the State 	for purposes 	of trade 	had to 	pay £3 	once for 	all, and 	in this way get their 	names registered. This 	was in no way 
 
 intended as a measure of identification.
  After 	British occupation 	all this was altered. 	A  measure 	called the 	Peace Preservation 	Ordinance was passed 	in 1902 	to prevent 	the entry 	of persons 	dangerous to the 	peace and 	good government 	of the 	Colony. This 	Ordinance made 	no distinction 	between Europeans and 	Asiatics. It 	was of general 	application. But in 	practice it 	was employed 	as an Indian 	Immigration Restriction measure. An 	attempt was 	made to 	enforce strictly the 	provisions of 	Law 3 	of 1885. 	When Lord 	Roberts was approached 	for relief, 	he said that the  Indian 	position would be 	ameliorated after 	the establishment of 	complete civil administration.libtech_763_footnotelibtech_764_footnoteWhen the latter was initiated, Lord Milner was approached.libtech_765_footnotelibtech_766_footnoteSeveral attempts were made by the Local Government to improve the 	position, but 	sufficient firmness was 	lacking to 	carry them 	into effect. The 	golden opportunity 	afforded by the 	new British occupation, 	of doing 	away with—among 	many other 	un-British laws—the 	equally un-British 	anti-Asiatic laws, was 	neglected or allowed to slip by. 	Every later attempt 	at amelioration, being 	unsuccessful, resulted 	in making 	the position 	of British 	Indians worse and worse.  Lord 	Milner (in 	1904) changed the 	scope and 	intention of 	Law 3 	of 1885 by 	using one 	of its 	clauses (with 	the consent of 	the British Indians) 	for the purpose 	of identifying 	every Asiatic in 	the Colony. 	Under this arrangement 	and under 	a definite 	promise in writing 	that such 	identification was 	to be final, 	almost every British 	Indian resident of 	the Colony 	took out a 	certificate containing 	his full 	description and his 	thumb-impression. 	Nevertheless, just 	before the 	grant  of 	responsible Government, 	the then 	Colonial Secretary, Mr. 	Duncan, (in 	1906) brought up a Billlibtech_767_footnotelibtech_768_footnotewhich ignored Lord Milner’s promise, which nullified the 	certificates above 	referred to , 	and made it 	obligatory on 	every indian and on 	other Asiatics 	to take 	out another 	identification ticket. 	The measure 	contained many 	other extremely 	objectionable clauses 	which need not be 	here described. Indians 	were greatly 	agitated. They 	bound themselves 	not to 	conform to the measure should it 	be sanctioned.  A 	deputation came 	to England 	(in the latter 	part of 1906), 	waited upon Lord Elgin, 	and the Bill was disallowed. 
 
  Responsible 	Government followed 	(in the 	beginning of 	1907). Almost the 	very first Act 	of the 	new Parliament was 	to restore 	the above 	measure, with one 	meaningless verbal 	alteration, not in 	any way 	affecting any 	of the 	objectionable clauses. 	In spite 	of Indian 	protests, it was 	hurried through 	Parliament and received 	the Royal assent on 	the 2nd March, 	1907. When this 	legislation was 	introduced by Mr. 	Duncan, it 	was stated 	that it 	was to 	be temporary and 	to be 	replaced by 	an immigration measure.  When, 	however, an 	Immigration Bill 	was passed, as 	it was 	during the 	same session, it 	was found 	that it did 	not repeal the 	Asiatic Bill 	(now Act), but that, 	read together with the 	latter, the 	effect was 	to bring 	about, in a 	circuitous manner, 	the total 	prohibition of 	Indian immigration. 	The two measures 	together, therefore, for 	the first time in 	the history 	of Colonial 	legislation, create a 	colour or 	racial bar 	in respect of 	immigration. (As 	to how 	the total prohibition 	of Indian immigration has 	been brought about by 	the two Acts 	read together, see Note B.)libtech_769_footnote  During 	the January 	of 1908, 	active steps were taken 	to enforce 	the provisions 	of the 	Asiatic Act 	(Act 2 	of 1907). The 	Indians, in 	accordance with 	their solemn pledge, 	declined to submit 	to it, 	and the 	leaders were prosecuted 	and imprisoned.  Through 	the intervention 	of Mr. 	Albert Cartwright, 	Editor of The 	Transvaal Leader, 	a compromise 	was effected. 	It was partly 	written and partly 	oral. Indians contend that 	General Smuts promised 	that, if they 	underwent identification 	voluntarily, the Asiatic 	 Act  should be 	repealed and 	their voluntary 	identification be 	legalised by 	means of 	another measure, 	preferably by amending 	the Immigration 	Bill which had 	now become law. (For 	fuller details of the 	compromise, see  Note 	 C.)libtech_770_footnotelibtech_771_footnoteIndians 	 have,  admittedly,  fulfilled  their  part  of 	  the 	compromise, and 	have asked for 	repeal of 	the Act.  General 	Smuts, on behalf 	of the 	Government, contends 	that he 	never made 	any promise 	of repeal, though 	he admits that the 	question of 	repeal was 	discussed between 	him and Mr. Gandhi 	and that there might have been a misunderstanding on Mr. Gandhi’s part. The 	facts proved and 	admitted are: 
 
   That 		Mr. Gandhi 		sent him (22nd 		February, 1908) 		a  draft  Billlibtech_772_footnotelibtech_773_footnoteby 		  his 		  permission, 		  one  clause  of 		  which 		repealed the 		Act. This was acknowledged, and 		 the  proposal 		to repeal 		was never repudiated.  That 		two days 		after the 		completion of 		the compromise, 		General Smuts stated at 		a  public  meeting (6th 		February, 1908) 		that “he had told 		them that the law 		would not 		be repealed 		so long 		as there 		was an 		Asiatic in 		the country 		who had 		not registered”, 		 and  again 		 that “until 		every Indian in the 		country had 		registered, the 		law would 		not be repealed”.  That 		General Smuts actually drafted and 		circulated an amendment 		of the 		Immigration Act 		(13th June, 1908) 		repealing the Asiatic 		Act, but imported 		therein four new 		conditions, one 		of which 		was that British Indians,  no  matter 		what their status 		might be, 		should be 		treated as 		prohibited immigrants. 		Acceptance of these 		new clauses 		by the 		Indian community he 		made a 		condition of 		carrying the amendment 		repealing the Asiatic 		Act. Indians would not 		accept the 		new conditions.   To 	resume. The 	Indians not 	accepting the 	new conditions, the 	repeal fell through. 	These new 	conditions were 	unacceptable to 	them because the 	first three took away 	the right 	of residence, 	in the 	Transvaal, of 	those British Indians 	who were at 	the time domiciled 	in the Colony, 	and the fourth 	condition, as 	stated above, 	constituted a 	national affront 	in that 	it prohibited 	the entry 	of British 	Indians, no 	matter how 	cultured they 	might be, 	on the 	ground of 	race. Thus 	it is 	clear that 	the repeal 	fell through, 	through no fault 	of the 	Indians. General 	Smuts went back even upon the 	written and 	manifest terms of 	the compromise. 	For, although 	in accordance 	with the written 	compromise (see Note 	C.), Act 2 of 1907 	was clearly 	not to be applied 	to those 	persons who had been 	voluntarily identified, 	and although 	their identification 	was to 	be legalised by 	a separate 	Act, a 	Bill was 	published (11th August, 1908libtech_774_footnotelibtech_775_footnote) bringing such Indians under Act 2 of 1907libtech_776_footnotelibtech_777_footnote. In consequence of this double breach of the compromise on 
 
 the part of Mr. Smuts, Indians held a mass meeting (16th August, 1908), burned about 2,500 of the certificates they had voluntarily taken out, and so rendered themselves amenable to prosecution. This induced a con-ference (18th August 1908libtech_778_footnote) between the Executive, the Progressive lea-ders, and Messrs Gandhi and Quinn (the Chinese leader)—Mr. Essop Mia, Chairman of the Association, not being available owing to short notice.
  As 	a result 	of the 	conference, a 	new Bill was brought in, 	placing voluntary 	registrants under a 	separate law. 	The question of 	repeal was 	discussed, but 	the Government 	would not 	listen to the proposal, 	saying that 	the Act would be 	treated as 	a dead 	letter. The 	question of 	the entry 	of highly 	educated Indians 	too was discussed, 	but no 	relief was 	promised under the 	Immigration Act, General 	Smuts only 	going so far 	as to say 	that temporary 	permits would be 	granted to 	such men.  Another 	mass meeting 	(20th August, 	1908) was, therefore, 	held to 	consider the 	result of 	the conference, 	and the meeting 	decided not 	to accept 	the new Bill, 	unless Act 	2 of 	1907 was 	repealed and 	highly edu-cated Indians 	might enter as a matter 	of right after 	passing the 	educational and 	other tests, 	however severe, under 	the general 	immigration lawlibtech_779_footnotelibtech_780_footnote.  The 	Government, however, 	carried their new Bill 	in spite 	of the 	Indian protests. 	The new 	Bill—which is otherwise generally 	acceptable—contains 	certain defects which 	need not be 	set out here 	and which 	were recounted in 	a petition submitted to 	the Imperial 	Government.libtech_781_footnote 
 THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS
  Apart 	from minor points 	arising out of 	the new Bill, 	the outstanding 	questions between 	the Transvaal Government 	and the 	Indian community are: 
 Repeal 	of Act 	2 of 	1907 and The 	status of 	highly educated Indians. 
  The 	Transvaal Government 	alleges that these two 	points are 	as good as 	granted, because— 
 
  Act 2 of 1907 is to be treated as a dead letter, and  Highly 	educated Indians can 	receive temporary 	permits to be 	indefinitely prolonged 	under a 	clause of the  new Asiatic Bill. 
 The 	Indians contend that 
  If 	Act 2 	of 1907 	is to be treated 	as a 	dead letter, 	it can 	serve no 	useful purpose to 	retain it 	on the Statute- book 	of the 	Colony. The 	Indians have (by 	reason  of 	broken promi-ses) 	grown suspicious 	and do  not 	understand the 	meaning of 	a law 	being a 	dead letter and, 	yet, remaining part of 	the laws 	of the 	country. If 	the Act is 	merely retained to 	satisfy the 	electors, they, 	being more intelligent, 	ought to 	understand that 	a law 	that is a 	dead letter 	need not encumber 	the Statute-book 	of the 	Colony, and lastly, 	notwithstanding the 	fact that the 	Government had 	pronounced this 	Act to be a 	dead letter, 	it has 	been— when 	it has suited the 	Government—put 	into active 	operation against 	the Indians, 	and there 	is nothing 	to bar 	its being 	put into 	effect at any 	time in future.  If 	the Transvaal 	Government are willing 	to admit 	highly educated Indians, they 	might as 	well admit 	them under 	the immigration 	law; unless 	the Government 	intend to 	insult the 	whole Indian people, it 	must be 	a matter 	of indifference 	to them 	whether educated 	Indians are 	admitted under the 	Asiatic Act 	or the 	Immigration Act; 	to the 	Indians it 	is a vital principle. 	The manner 	of admission 	is everything 	to them. 	They are 	more anxious 	that one 	educated Indian 	who enters the Colony 	should do  so  under 	the general 	immigration law and 	through the 	front door 	of right 	than that twenty or 	more Indians 	should enter 	the Colony 	through the back 	door of favouritism 	and as 	ticket-of-leave men, entitled to remain 	in the Transvaal 	only during the pleasure 	of the Government. 
  This 	question of 	educated Indians is 	the crux. 	There is no 	desire to 	flood the 	Transvaal with 	British Indians. Indians 	recognize that 	the British and 	Boer population should 	remain predominant in 	South Africa. 	But they 	contend that 	the Colony of 	the Transvaal should 	not be 	allowed to 	offer a 	national insult in 	carrying out 	that policy. 
 
  Moreover, 	Indians who are resident 	in the 	Transvaal, if 	they are 	to rise 	in the 	social and 	moral scale, require 	the help 	of their highly 	educated brethren. In 	order to 	prove their bona 	fides, they 	declare that 	they would 	not mind 	an  administration 	 of  the 	Immigration Law 	so as to admit 	the fewest possible 	Indians (say six) 	in any 	one year. While they 	object to 	legal inequality and 	legal discrimination, 	they are 	prepared to 	put up 	with administrative 	discrimination. This 	very thing is 	now being 	done in 	Australia. It 	was done in 	the Transvaal under the 	Peace Preservation Ordinance 	previously referred 	to. They further 	submit that, if the 	present law 	does not 	confer sufficient 	administrative authority, the 	Act may be amended 	in the 	desired direction, but 	not so as to perpetuate 	a racial 	distinction. 
 UNDER THE NEW CONSTITUTION
  Under 	the new Constitution, 	the position 	of British 	Indians requires 	careful safeguarding, unless they 	are ultimately to 	be driven out 	of, or 	extinguished in, South 	Africa. They 	are practically 	unrepresented. What 	little representation 	they have 	enjoyed at 	 the Cape and Natal is 	to be of no effect under 	the new Constitution. 	The union of 	the Europeans 	in South 	Africa will, if the 	Imperial authority 	is not 	properly retained, spell 	disaster to 	vested Indian rights. 	In the 	Orange River Colony, 	Indians, save as menials, are not admitted. In the 	Transvaal, apart 	from the 	above-mentioned 	legislation, they 	are debarred 	the right 	of buying 	land except 	in locations 	specially set apart 	for them, 	and even 	this right is withheld. 	In Natal, 	Indian traders are 	being starved out 	under a 	one-sided and 	oppressive 	administration of 	the licensing 	law of 	the Colony. 	Minor grievances  	throughout South 	Africa are too numerous 	to set 	out in detail. 	They affect 	the daily 	life of 	the Indian 	and make 	it well-nigh 	intolerable, by 	continually reminding 	him that 	the wearing 	of a brown 	skin is a crime 	in the 	sub-continent. The 	unmistakable tendency of 	the legislation 	in South 	Africa is to impose 	restrictions on 	Indian liberty in 	the same 	proportion as the liberties of the European races are extended.  It 	is, therefore, 	a matter 	of paramount 	importance, both from an 	Imperial and 	an Indian 	standpoint, that the 	Transvaal  Indian 	question be 	satisfactorily settled. It is an undoubted 	fact that the Transvaal 	is the 	predominant State in 	South Africa. It 	leads; the 	other States 	follow. If, therefore, 	the Transvaal 	Indian legislation is 	not first 	set on a firm and equitable basis, the Transvaal legislation is sure to be 
 copied under the Union, and then the Imperial Government will be powerless to afford relief.
 THE INDIAN COVENANT
  Moreover, 	the Indians 	are bound 	by a 	solemn covenant to 	secure the 	above relief, even though 	they may 	have to suffer 	imprisonment and 	worse, for 	an indefinite 	length of 	time. In 	virtue thereof, 	over 2,500 	imprisonments, mostly 	with hard 	 labour,  have 	taken place during 	the two years and six 	months that 	the struggle has 	lasted. The 	prison life 	has been anything 	but tolerable. Indian prisoners 	are classed and 	accommodated with the 	South African Natives, 	and two-thirds 	of their 	food is the same 	as that 	of the Natives. 	There is 	no such thing as 	a political 	offence in the 	Transvaal. Indian 	prisoners, whom General 	Smuts himself 	has called conscientious 	objectors, are 	imprisoned with 	the worst criminals.  The 	 labour required 	of them 	is generally 	of a 	severe character. 	Indians who have 	never lifted a 	heavy weight or 	done any 	spadde work have been 	put to 	wheeling heavily loaded barrows, digging holes repairing roads, 	etc., side 	by side with Kaffir convicts of the worst type.  Many 	Indian families have 	been reduced to 	poverty. Many 	homes have been broken 	up. And several 	families whose wage-earners 	are now in 	the Transvaal 	gaols are dependent 	for their daily bread on 	public charity.  Latterly, 	the Government, 	by means 	of a 	secret arrangement 	with the 	Portuguese authorities, 	have taken to deporting 	to India 	those who 	do not comply with the 	provisions of 	the Asiatic Act 	and who can be 	dealt with 	under the 	deportation sections 	of that 	Act. Under this 	procedure children 	have been torn from 	their parents; boys 	born in South 	Africa, and to 	whom India 	is a 	foreign land, have 	been sent penniless 	to India. 	And, although Lord 	Crewe has denied 	that those who 	are domiciled in 	any of 	the South 	African Colonies outside 	the Transvaal 	are deported, at 	least one such 	case has undoubtedly 	happened of 	an Indian 	possessing educational 	attainments, and 	therefore capable of 	residing in 	Natal or 	the Cape, 	and possessing 	domicile in 	Delagoa Bay, being 	deported to India.  These 	are the means that the Government 	are using to 	bend the 	Indian covenanters 	to their will, 	and while 	they have 	partly succeeded, a 	sufficiently large 	number remains who show 	no signs 	of weakening. 	The most 	influential Mohammedan, 	and an 	undisputed leader of the Indians in South Africa, Mr. Dowd Mohmed, a resident 
 
 of many years’ standing in the Transvaal, and a man over 50 years of age; Mr. Parsee Rustomjee, a most prominent Parsee—another recognised leader—a man who has spent hundreds of pounds in the cause of education (even of children belonging to a faith not his own)—are both undergoing six months’ imprisonment with hard labour. Two ex-sergeants, who served during the late Zulu rebellion and who are holders of the rebellion medals, are also undergoing a like term of imprisonment. At the present time there are nearly one hundred objectors undergoing imprisonment, and most of these have been through the gaols more than once in the course of the struggle.
 THE EUROPEAN COMMITTEE
  Actuated 	by sympathy 	with the 	Indians in 	their sufferings, 	and believing 	in the 	justice of 	their cause, 	certain leading Europeans 	of Johannesburg 	have formed themselves 	into a 	committee to 	secure relief. 	This committee is led 	by Mr. 	William Hosken, M.L.A., 	and has 	been working actively in 	the matter. 
 CONCLUSION
  Apart 	from any 	promise made by 	General Smuts, 	it is submitted that 	the two indian demands 	are intrinsically 	just, that it 	is not 	difficult for 	the Government to 	grant them, and 	that, in 	order to 	have them granted, 	the Transvaal 	Indians have gone 	through a long 	course of 	sustained suffering. In 	the circumstances, 	they feel that their 	covenant should be 	respected, and 	that regard for 	the wishes of 	the self-governing 	Colonies should not 	debar the 	Imperial Government 	from protecting 	British subjects in the 	same way 	as it would 	protect them 	in foreign 	countries—the more 	so when such 	subjects are 	unrepresented, as in the present instance.libtech_782_footnote

 FOOTNOTE TO THE STATEMENT
Since preparing the foregoing statement, the delegates have
 
 received a telegram which shows that an Indian youth named Nagappen, who was sentenced on the 21st June last to be imprisoned for ten days with hard labour, in connection with the struggle, was discharged on the 30th June in a dying condition, and died on the 6th July. The allegations according to the cablegram are  that  it  was bitterly cold, the blankets supplied ware insufficient, the native warders were brutal, and medical attendance was not forthcoming. The same cablegram adds that Mr. Dowd Mahomed, one of the foremost Indians in South Africa, over fifty years old, and who was suffering imprisonment for six months, was discharged owing to illness. The date of the cablegram is 12th July, and if he was discharged after the death of Nagappen, he had completed five months’ imprisonment.
 Note A
 UNDER THE BOER Regime	SINCE BRITISH ANNEXATION
  	Asiatics could freely enter the Republic and, subsequent to 1885, 	could reside and trade on payment of a £3 tax.  	“Registration” required by Law 3 of 1885 (amended in 1886) did 	not include identification particulars. It consisted merely of the 	payment of the £3 fee and the holding of the receipt therefor.                	Asiatics were denied burgher rights.  	Only such Asiatics as could prove pre-war residence have been 	re-admitted.    	“Registration” voluntarily assented to by Asiatics in 1903, 	under advice of Lord Milner, included very full indentification 	particulars.  Re-registration 	under the Act of 1907 is 	compulsory and  	additionally humiliating in details. It applies to all children from 	eight years of age upwords. Failure to re-register entails fine, 	im-prisonment, and expulsion. (Since modified by Act 36 of 1908).  	Asiatics, including British Indians, are excluded from both 	political and  municipal privileges. 
 Asiatics might not own fixed property, save in Asiatic locations.
 Asiatics were liable to be relegated to streets, wards, and locations specially set apart for that purpose.
This is still the case.
 
 
 Asiatics, including British Indians, are still so liable, and are threatened with such segregation.
   
  	Whereas Law 3 imposing the above  disabilities  was virtually 	inoperative, British Indians [were] being  protected by His 	Majesty’s Government.  	Responsible English Mini- sters claimed for British Indians the 	equal rights of civilized subjects of the Empire. The British 	Government virtually pledged itself to the reinstatement in their 	just rights of Transvaal British Indians.    	British Indian protests agaist the Boer Law were supported by 	Imperial Govern- ment, and the insistence by the Republic of its 	right to legislate indiscriminately against Asiatics within its 	borders figured promi- nently in the causes that led up to the war.  	Generally, while theoreti- cally British Indians were placed under 	the above disabilities, in practice the law was not strictly 	enforced.  	Since the annexation, and more especially since the  grant of 	responsible government, British Indians have failed to secure such 	Imperial protection.  	The British Government have apparently abandoned the self-same 	Indians, who resided in the Colony prior to its annexa- tion, to the 	tyranny of trade rivals, and of a Government largely composed of 	legislators who were responsible for the Boer Law 3 of 1885.  	Now, for want of effective Imperial protection, British Indians have 	been obliged to fall back on passive resistance, which has resulted 	in the imprisonment of 2,500 of their number, and other sufferings.      	The restrictions upon the freedom of British Indians have been 	enforced with the utmost rigour, and the absence of a penalty clause 	to Law 3 of 1885 has alone saved the Indians from its worst 	consequences. 
 NOTE B
 The Asiatic Bill provides that every Asiatic in the Colony should take out an identification ticket, and it also defines an Asiatic eligible for receiving such ticket. The definition states that only an Asiatic who is domiciled in the Transvaal from before the passing of this measure shall be eligible. The Bill further provides that every Asiatic who is held to be ineligible is subject to a removal order from the Colony.
 The Immigration Bill, among other provisions, makes a person who is subject to a removal order a prohibited immigrant. Now, an educated Indian who has not been domiciled in the Colony before the passing of the Asiatic Bill is ineligible for holding an identification ticket, and is therefore subject to a removal order, and thus, under the Immigration Bill, is a prohibited immigrant.
 NOTE C
The written compromise was that—
 British 	Indians should voluntarily identify themselves.  That 	Act 2 of 	1907 should 	not be 	applied to 	such British 	Indians, and 	that the voluntary 	identification should be 	legalised by 	a separate measure. 
 These terms are embodied in a letter addressed by Messrs Gandhi, Quinn, and Naidoo to the Transvaal Colonial Secretary, and dated 28th January, 1908libtech_783_footnotelibtech_784_footnote. Two days after the receipt of the letter, Mr. Gandhi, who was then a prisoner, was taken to Pretoria to discuss the compromise with the Colonial Secretary (Mr. Smuts), and a further discussion took place subsequent thereto. At these  interviews, according to Mr. Gandhi’s statement, Mr. Smuts promised to repeal the Asiatic Act (2 of 1907) on the completion by the Asiatics of their part of the bargain, i.e., voluntarily identifying themselves.libtech_785_footnote

DEAR MR. MERRIMAN,

  From 	a photostat: Gandhiji’s Letters to Merriman. Courtesy: South 	African Library, Cape Town         [After 	July 16, 1909]  CURZON 	WYLLIE’S 	ASSASSINATION  	Under the heading “Deputation Notes”, I have given all the 	information about the activities of the deputation that can be made 	public. Under the above heading, I give other news worth reporting.  	The assassination of Sir Curzon Wyllie and Dr. Lalkaka was a 	terrible thing. Sir Curzon Wyllie served as an officer at several 	places in India. Here he was Lord Morley’s aide-de-camp. Dr. 	Lalkaka was a Parsi physician and carried on business at Shanghai in 	China. He was here on a short visit only.  	On July 2, there was a tea-meeting of the National Indian 	Association in the Jehangir Hall of the Imperial Institute. Such 	meetings are arranged with the object of bringing Indian students 	into contact with Englishmen, who therefore attend as the  guests  	of Indians. Sir Curzon Wyllie was [thus] a guest of the assassin. 	From this 
 point of view, Mr. Madanlal Dhingra murdered his guest in his own house, and also killed Dr. Lalkaka who tried to interpose himself between them.
 It is being said in defence of Sir Curzon Wyllie’s assassination that it is the British who are responsible for India’s ruin, and that, just as the British would kill every German if Germany invaded Britain, so too it is the right of any Indian to kill any Englishman.
 Every Indian should reflect thoughtfully on this murder. It has done India much harm; the deputation’s efforts have also received a setback. But that need not be taken into consideration. It is the ultimate result that we must think of. Mr. Dhingra’s defence is inadmissible. In my view, he has acted like a coward. All the same, one can only pity the man. He was egged on to do this act by ill-digested reading of worthless writings. His defence of himself, too, appears to have been learnt by rote. It is those who incited him to this that deserve to be punished. In my view, Mr. Dhingra himself is innocent. The murder was committed in a state of intoxication. It is not merely wine or bhang that makes one drunk; a mad idea also can do so. That was the case with Mr. Dhingra. The analogy of Germans and Englishmen is fallacious. If the Germans were to invade [Britain], the British would kill only the invaders. They would not  kill  every  German whom they met. Moreover, they would not kill an unsuspecting German, or Germans who are guests. If I kill someone in my own house without a warning—someone who has done me no harm—I cannot but be called a coward. There is an ancient custom among the Arabs that they would not kill anyone in their own house, even if the person be their enemy. They would kill him after he had left the house and after he had been given time to arm himself. Those who believe in violence would be brave men if they observe these rules when killing anyone. Otherwise, they must be looked upon as cowards. It may be said that what Mr. Dhingra did, publicly and knowing full well that he himself would have to die, argues courage of no mean order on his part. But as I have said above, men can do these things in a state of intoxication, and can also banish the fear of death. Whatever courage there is in this is the result of intoxication, not a quality of the man himself. A man’s own courage consists in suffering deeply and over a long period. That alone is a brave act which is preceded by careful reflection.
 I must say that those who believe and argue that such murders may do good to India are ignorant men indeed. No act of treachery can ever profit a nation. Even should the British leave in consequence of such murderous acts, who will rule in their place? The only answer
 is: the murderers. Who will then be happy? Is the Englishman bad because he is an Englishmen? Is it that everyone with an Indian skin is good? If that is so, we can claim no rights in South Africa, nor should there be any angry protest against oppression by Indian princes. India can gain nothing from the rule of murderers—no matter whether they are black or white. Under such a rule, India will be utterly ruined and laid waste. This train of thought leads to a host of reflections, but I have no time to set them down here. I am afraid some Indians will commend this murder. I believe they will be guilty of a heinous sin. We ought to abandon such fanciful ideas. More about this later.
 “ SUFFRAGIST”
 The British women who have been demanding the franchise are putting up a wonderful show. They are not deterred by any kind of suffering. Some of these ladies have suffered in health, but they do not give up the struggle. Every day a number of them keep standing the whole night near Parliament gate with the intention of handing in  a petition of Mr. Asquith. This is no ordinary courage. What great faith they must have ! A great many women have been ruined, and more are being ruined, in this struggle, but they do not yield. Their campaign has gone on for a longer time than ours. We can learn quite a few things and draw much inspiration from it.

PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES
SIR,
 Mr. Ritch, the Secretary to the South Africa British Indian Committee, has already reported to the Right Honourable the  Secretary of State for the Colonies the arrival of a delegation  on behalf of British Indians in the Transvaal.
 It consists of Mr. Hajee Habib of Pretoria, merchant and  President of the pretoria Anjuman Islam and myself, two other
 delegateslibtech_786_footnotehaving  been  arrested  and  imprisoned  under  the   Asiatic Registration Act before their departure.
 My colleague and I have purposely refrained from seeking an interview with His Lordship, because we are endeavouring at the present moment to secure a settlement of the difficult question that has brought us here, without having to trouble the Imperial Government, but as the Conference regarding the South African Draft Act commences to-day, we consider it desirable that we should draw His Lordship’s attention to the fact that the Transvaal Indian question has involved untold suffering to British Indians in that Colony,and that it still continues to cause grave anxiety to the British Indian leaders.
 At the present stage we are desirous of avoiding a public discussion of the question, so as to facilitate a private settlement. We shall, therefore, be deeply grateful to His Lordship if he  will  be pleased to grant us a private interview, so as to enable us to place the position to date before His Lordship.
 I have the honour to remain, Sir,

  	I am extremely obliged to Your Lordship for your letter of the 20th 	inst. I am very sorry for the proper address not being on my letterlibtech_787_footnote. The fact is, I have a special index of addresses, 	which  was prepared when the deputation was last here. Miss Polak, 	who is still new to the work, looked up the index book and took down 	from     sequently 	to have addressed him a letter which is not available. 
 among the three addresses given against your name the first one, which was put in there from a directory. The Bedford address was the third on the list, but as the work has been done somewhat under pressure, she hurriedly took the first, hence the mistake.
 I agree with Your Lordship that Mr. Merriman’s letterlibtech_788_footnoteis rather discouraging. At the same time, I respectfully venture to think that, if somehow or other you could come in personal contact with the South African politicians, it will be useful for future action in connection with the Imperial work that you, as President of the South Africa British Indian Committee, are engaged in.
 There is no doubt that, under the Union , a great deal of trouble is in store for British Indians throughout South Africa.
 The Hon’ble Mr. Sauer, to whom also I wrote,libtech_789_footnotelibtech_790_footnotehas  not  said anything in reply, from which I assume he retains still the same  position that he did on board.
 I am obliged to Your Lordship for offering to see Sir W. Lee- Warner. I can well understand the pressure on your valuable time. It is therefore a matter for grateful satisfaction to all who know Your Lordship, as it is to my colleague and myself, that amid your many duties you find time to give so much attention to the British Indian question in the Transvaal and other parts of South Africa.
 I have already addressed a letterlibtech_791_footnoteto the Private Secretary to the Earl of Crewe asking for a private interview, and a similar applicationlibtech_792_footnotehas gone forward to the Private Secretary to Lord Morley.

248,"July 	22, 1909",LETTER TO “SOUTH AFRICA”,"
            SIR,         [LONDON,]  July 	22, 1909 
 In 	your leading article in the current number, you state that:  Mr. 	Gandhi, of Natal and Transvaal fame, admits that the campaign of 	himself and his friends will be dictated by sympathisers in England, 	whose names by the way are unfortunately associated with the 	dangerous movement in India, which has been brought into such 	startling prominence of late. Will 	you kindly allow me to say in reply that what I said to  	Reuter’s Agentlibtech_793_footnotewas 	that our movements will be guided by the advice that may be given us 	by Lord Ampthill and his Committee.  	I am not aware that Lord Ampthill or his colleagues are associated 	with what you call “the dangerous movement in India”. Moreover, 	for passive resisters there can be no dictation save that of their 	consciences. They are under solemn obligation to secure what they 	are justly entitled to, and, in their endeavour to do so, they are 	resolved to undergo personal suffering to any extent, not even 	excluding death. The test of true passive resistance is sacrifice of 	self and not of others.  Indian 	Opinion, 21-8-1909   "
249,"July 	22, 1909",LETTER TO H. S. L. POLAK,"
           MY 	DEAR HENRY,         [LONDON,] July 	22, 1909 
  	I have nothing very startling to report. Mr. Ameer Ali who saw Sir 	Richard, came over yesterday to the hotel and he seemed rather 	hopeful. Sir William Lee-Warner and Mr. Morison were also at the 	hotel, but they merely wanted to understand the true position.  	I enclose herewith the copy of a letter from Lord Ampthill, which 	speaks for itself. I have applied for a private interview with the 	Colonial Secretary, as also with the Secretary of State for India. 	There appears in today’s Morning Post a statement to the 	effect that the    
 control of differential Asiatic legislation will be in the hands of the Governor-General and Council and not in the hands of the Provincial Councils. I do not know what this means; it may mean much or it may mean little.
 Mr. Merriman, to whose letter Lord Ampthill had made reference, states that, beyond expressing the wish that there should be no legislation repellent to the Liberal principles which the South African statesmen pretended to profess, he would not be able to do anything. We have seen Steadlibtech_794_footnotelibtech_795_footnotewho too has promised to see General Smuts. I need not worry you with the names of others whom we have seen. By the time this letter reaches you, the result of the private negotiations will have been known; I therefore do not want to forecast it.
 I am certain that you will cable your arrival in India. It is a pity I do not know the name of the steamer by which you were to go to India. However, I am sending a cablelibtech_796_footnoteto Daphtary with a view to his making some arrangements in advance.
 Millie will be here the day after to-morrow. Mater has already engaged apartments—two bedrooms and one sitting room for £1 per week. They will be fixed up there but will take their meals with Mater. This appears to me to be a very serviceable arrangement, and will give Millie complete rest. The weather just now is very fine and it ought to prove very suitable for the children.
 I think I forgot to mention to you the name of Professor Bhandar-karlibtech_797_footnotelibtech_798_footnote. He is, as you know, one of the greatest Sanskrit scholars of the age. I am sure you will go to Poona; you should then make it a point to see him; you may even draw him out of his seclusion on this question, but, in any case, it would be better for you to come in contact with him. You should also see Mr. Nazar’slibtech_799_footnotelibtech_800_footnoteson. His address is Girgaum.
 I am sending you a copy of the list of those who took part in the banquet to the Ottoman Parliament delegates. The function  was brilliant but I came away from it much saddened. The banqueting hall

The fumes from the wine-glasses and the smoke from the cigars or cigarettes, smoked by nearly three hundred guests, had a most depressing effect on the  mind. I then involuntarily called it “refined savagery”, and it reminded me of the scene described by poets at banquets held by Rakshasa.

  	By the time this reaches you, Mr. Polak will have been in India. Our 	work here is very difficult; this, however, will be no news to you. 	I merely mention it by way of introduction, in order to enable me to 	ask you if you can spare the time to give special attention to it.  	I am most anxious that our leaders should realize the national 	importance of the struggle. Mr. Polak has been sent as a missionary 	to do this work. We will continue to suffer in the Transvaal until 	justice is granted, but we have a right to expect much more than we 	have yet received from the Motherland.  	Mr. Polak’s work is very difficult. I have asked him to place 	him-self unreservedly under your instructions and I know that you 	will not spare yourself in making his work as light as possible. We 	are endeavouring by private negotiations to arrive at a settlement, 	but I know Mr. Smuts too well to put much faith in these 	negotiations. In a week’s time we may be obliged to take public 	action, and in that case it will be absolutely necessary for India 	to support our prayer, if we are to do anything at all. May I look 	to you to do whatever you may      
 consider necessary?libtech_807_footnote
 I enclose herewith a summary of a longer statement that we have prepared, and that will be published immediately the result of the negotiations is known—provided they are unsuccessful.

DR. ABDUL MAJID
 
 
[July 23, 1909]
  	A party was arranged in honour of Syed Abdul Majid, LL.D., who is 	proceeding to India in a few days. Mr. Hajee Habib and I attended it 	by invitation. An occasion offering itself, there was a discussion 	on the Transvaal problem. Dr. Syed Abdul Majid promised to work [for 	us] in India. Some whites were also present  at  the function. Mr. 	Ritch, too, attended.  OTTOMAN 	PARTY  	Some members of the Turkish Parliament have arrived here specially 	with the intention of meeting prominent leaders of the British 	nation. A dinner was given in their honour in Hotel Cecil. Among the 	members, the chief is Mr. Tallat. Others include Mustafa Arif Bey, 	Jawad Bey, Dr. Reeza Taufik Bey, Mehmen Ali Bey, Zuberzade, Ahmed 	Pasha, Mighat Bey, Suleman Khustani, Nazim Mazalian Effendi, Sassoon 	Effendi and Fazal Arif Effendi.  	The party must have been attended by nearly 300 persons. The Earl of 	Oslo was in the chair. Lord Curzon was also present. About 50 	Indians attended. Among them were Mr. Justice Ameer Ali, Nawab 	Imd-ul-Mulk Syed Hussain Bilgrami, Major Syed Hussain, Sir Muncherji 	Bhownag-gree and others.  	Lord Curzon was the principal speaker. Mr. Suleman Khustani, who 	replied on behalf of the Turkish members, is a Christian. He said 	that in the Turkish Empire all enjoyed equal rights.  DHINGRA 	CASE  	Mr. Madanlal Dhingra’s case came up for hearing today (the 23rd). 	We were no permitted not be present in the court. Since Mr. Dhingra 	did not put up any defence, the case did not take much time. He only 	stated that he had done the deed for the good of his country, and 	that he did not regard it as a crime. The presiding judge sentenced 	him to death. I have already given my views about this 	assassination.libtech_809_footnotelibtech_810_footnoteMr. Dhingra’s statement, according to me, argues mere 	childishness or mental derangement. Those who incited him to this 	act will be called to account in God’s court, and are also guilty 	in the eyes of the world.    
 SHADOW OF DHINGRA CASE
 Mr. Dhingra’s case has led to Government action against The Indian Sociologist. The journal had published a categorical statement that homicide for the good of one’s country was no murder. The printer, poor man, has been sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for printing such a violent article. The man who has been sentenced is a poor, innocent Englishman, who was entirely ignorant [of what he was printing]. The authors are in Paris, and hence the Government is unable to get at them. Such acts will not advance the progress of the nation. So long as the people do not throw up men who will be prepared to invite the utmost suffering on themselves, India will never prosper.
 NATAL DEPUTATION
 The Natal deputation is due to arrive next week. By that time, the Union Act will have been passed. The conference over the Act is in session. It is not likely to propose any important modifications. It appears that amendment of the existing laws relating to the Coloured races will be kept within the jurisdiction of the Union Parliament. This means nothing. If not actual death, it is something very much like it. I am afraid the Natal deputation is arriving too late. Even otherwise, I do not think much could have been achieved.
 DR. ABDURRAHMAN
 Dr. Abdurrahman has been working very hard. He has had an interview even with Lord Crewe. But it does not seem likely that it will lead to anything. Mr. Schreiner has been striving hard. There will be a party in his honour on the 27th in the Hotel, from where I am writing this.

TO
 THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE COLONIAL OFFICE
WHITEHALL,  S. W.
SIR,
 With reference to your letter of the 23rd instant No. 24316/1909—I have the honour to state that my colleague and I, if received, will, in view of the approaching unification of South Africa, place before His Lordship the position of the British Indians in the Transvaal as it arises from, and is affected by, the voluntary suffering that the British Indians in the Transvaal have undergone and are still undergoing. It was the wish of the majority of those British Indians who, being too weak to put up with physical suffering or to risk pecuniary loss, have yielded obedience to the Asiatic Registration Act they nevertheless do not like, that we should proceed to London and, taking advantage of the presence in London of the chief members of the Transvaal Government, lay before His Lordship the  Indian  position in the hope of securing friendly intervention and thereby, if possible, ending a situation that has caused untold suffering to hundreds of innocent British Indians.
 British Indians in the Transvaal have, for the past two years and six months, been moving the transvaal Government to repeal the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907, and so remove the humiliation it imposes upon them, and to respect the status of highly  educated Indians desiring to enter the Transvaal in accordance with British traditions and in a manner similar to that obtaining in the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope and the other British Colonies.
 I venture to hope that His Lordship will be pleased to give us an opportunity of laying the case before him personally, and so carry out the purpose for which we have been specially sent by the Indian community in the Transvaal.
 I have, etc.,

  	Mr. Hajee Habib, President of the Pretoria Anjuman-e-Islam and I, as 	you may be aware, are in London as a deputation on behalf of the 	Transvaal British Indians in connection with the struggle that has 	now gone on in that Colony for the last two years and a half.

  From 	a photostat: BC. 112 file 12 (3.1). Courtesy: University Library, 	Cape Town, South Africa.         [July 	24, 1909]  	I think I reported last week that we met Sir William Lee-Warner and 	Mr. Morison in the hotel where we are staying. They expressed their 	sympathy. Afterwards we met Major Syed Hussain Bilgrami. He has 	agreed to do his best. We also saw, through the good offices of Miss 	Winterbottom, a lady named Mrs. Tedman. She has married a      After 	21-8-1909.  
 Dutchman. Mr. Tedman works for a Dutch newspaper there and knows General Botha and others. He has promised to see General Botha. We also called on a journalist named Mr. Brown, who had been helpful during the previous deputation [in 1906].
 The Parsi Anjuman gave a dinner in honour of one Mr.  Bhedwar, a Parsi barrister, with Sir Muncherji in the chair. We were invited to attend the function. [Several] Indians made speeches on that occasion promising to help us. We, too, as also Mr. Ritch, were given an opportunity to say a few words on the subject.
 We had an interview with Mr. Stead, editor of the Review of Reviews. He is on good terms with General Smuts and has promised to see him.
 We met Mr. Gupta and Nawab Imd-ul-Mulk Syed Hussain Bilgrami, members of the India Office. We have explained the entire position to them.
 We had meetings with others also, but these, being unimportant, I am not reporting.
 As advised by Lord Ampthill, we have requested Lord Crewe and Lord Morley to fix time for interviews with them. There has been a reply from Lord Crewe, asking us to give reasons why we want to see him. We have sent a reply.libtech_814_footnotelibtech_815_footnoteWhether an interview will be granted or not will be known next week.
 The more experience I have of meeting so-called big men or even men who are really great, the more disgusted I feel after every such meet-ing. All such efforts are no better than pounding chaff. Everyone appears preoccupied with his own affairs. Those who  occupy positions of power show little inclination to do justice. Their only concern is to hold on to their positions. We have to spend a whole day in arranging for an interview with one or two persons. Write   a letter to the person concerned, wait for his reply, acknowledge it and then go to his place. One may be living in the north and another in the south. Even after all this fuss, one cannot be very hopeful about the outcome. If considera-tions of justice had any appeal, we would have got [what we want] long before now. The only possibility is that some concessions may be granted through fear. It can  give  no  pleasure to a satyagrahi to have to work in such conditions.
 I think it will be far better to submit to still further suffering than exhaust ourselves in such efforts and waste so much money on them. If, in spite of the difficulties, our demands are conceded, I shall
 
 
 conclude that we had suffered enough to have earned the concessions. If they are not conceded,I shall believe that still more sacrifices are called for. I can think of no course so wonderfully effective as voluntary suffering. Even the most powerful orators cannot protest as effectively as [such] suffering can. Suffering is bound to bring  redress. Those who are pre- pared to suffer need not advertise their suffering. I believe, It will speak for itself. Accordingly. I advise every Indian to have suffering as his companion. Everything else is mere bubbles in water. Do not expect much from the deputation. Always bear in mind that there is no help like self-help, and ready for gaol. That way alone lies victory.
 The cables received from other towns have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and the India Office.
 INOPPORTUNE
 Everyone believes that the deputation has arrived at an inopportune time. In no more than a few days, all the important men will have left London. They take a holiday in the month of August. It is therefore difficult to undertake any public activity. The situation is awkward, to be sure, but the circumstances would not have permitted sending the deputation at some other time. It was necessary that it should have been here just when the others from South Africa were here. And the upshot of it is that, if the private moves bear no fruit, there is precious little possibility of gaining anything through public representations.

           MY 	LORD,           [LONDON,]  July 	26, 1909 
  	I am obliged to Your Lordship for your letter of  the  24th instant.  	I do not put the interpretation you have upon the absence of reply 	from Mr. Sauer,libtech_816_footnotefor 	I simply informed him that Your Lordship    
 would probably write to him. I am, therefore, rather inclined to think that he is still in the same receptive mood that I found him in on board. I told Your Lordship that Mr. Sauer was more enthusiastic than Mr. Merriman.
 Mr. Hajee Habib and I have just returned from a private visit to Lord Morley. His Lordship gave us a very sympathetic consideration and said that he would write to Lord Crewe, and on my suggestion, agreed to discuss the question with Mr. Smuts. Lord Crewe has not yet sent an appointment, but he has asked us to reduce to writing the points we would discuss at the interview, if granted. The letter giving the points went forward on Saturday.libtech_817_footnote
 Sir Richard Solomon has sent a confidential note saying that he has already discussed the whole question with Mr. Smuts, but that it might be some time before General Smuts decides, as he would be very busy with the conference work. As I know Mr. Smuts so very well, this delay is somewhat ominous, because he has more than once put off friends who have approached him on inconvenient matters. Should we, apart from an interview with Lord Morley and that with Lord Crewe—if it is granted, make a written submission, a short statement is quite ready.libtech_818_footnoteI have refrained from having it printed for circulation because of the negotiations that are going on, but if the progress of the negotiations virtually enforce silence upon us, that can hardly apply to the friends of the cause. Would not the purpose be served if Your Lordship wrote, or several public men jointly wrote, to Lord Crewe urging him to use his good offices with the Transvaal ministers to signalize the advent of the Union, by granting the small concessions to British Indians in the Transvaal, who have suffered so

 Your Lordship may have noticed that a deputation on behalf of the Aborigines’ Protection Society was to have waited upon the South African Premiers and other public men, and that it did not so wait only because Sir Charles Dilkelibtech_820_footnote, who was to have led the deputation, could not accept the time that was appointed by these gentlemen.
 I cannot help feeling that, if Your Lordship were still to seek a dis-cussion with Mr. Merriman and Mr. Sauer or, failing them, with Messrs Botha and Smuts, it cannot but be good. May I also state that it is very largely within the power of Sir George Farrarlibtech_821_footnotelibtech_822_footnoteand Sir Percy Fitzpatricklibtech_823_footnoteto bring about a settlement,and if Your Lordship could even see them, I am sure a way would be opened to a satisfactory solution.
 I would venture to invite Your Lordship’s special attention to the current number of Indian Opinion; it contains three remarkable petitionslibtech_824_footnoteand facts about the Indian deputation.
 I hope that Your Lordship will pardon me for encroaching upon your time.

THE PRIVATE SECRETARY TO
 THE RIGHT HON’BLE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA WHITEHALL, S. W.
SIR,
 I shall be obliged if you will place the following before Lord Morley:
 At   the   private   interviewlibtech_825_footnotethat   His   Lordship   was   graciously pleased to grant to Mr. Hajee Habib and myself, I was unable, owing to want of time, to say all I had intended to . I wish, therefore, on behalf of my colleague and myself to state that the two outstanding questions between the Transvaal Government and the Indian community—namely, the repeal of the Asiatic Act and the guarding of the status of educated British Indians on a basis similar to that adopted in the other Colonies, are the questions which are  of paramount importance, because of the solemn covenant undertaken by the community. This, however, does not mean that the British Indians do not feel aggrieved about the other disabilities in the Transvaal, such, for instance, as the prohibition to hold  landed property, riding on the tramcars, etc.
 We, however,feel that these questions are not those for which the community has suffered imprisonment or suffered such personal hardships as it has for the removal of those two grievances. British Indians will, however, continue to adopt the means they have hitherto adoptedfor the removal of the other disabilities. But the  two  grievances above. named have been separated from the others by reason of the terrible suffering that they have involved and will  continue to involve until a proper settlement is arrived at.
 My colleague and I trust that Lord Morley will be able to find time to give special attention to this matter and, by his friendly offices on behalf of those whose interests are in his keeping secure an honourable settlement.
 I have, etc.,

 [After July 26,1909]
 There have been very few interviews during this week. Most of the time was spent in writing letters and meeting all sorts of people.
 MOST IMPORTANT INTERVIEW
 The  most   important   interviewlibtech_826_footnotewas  with  Lord   Morley.   The gentleman saw us in his private capacity. It is difficult to say whether his reply was satisfactory or not. I shall only say that he has promised to help.
 Lord Ampthill has been striving hard. What he has been doing is completely private, so that I shall write nothing about it. He is fully confident that a settlement will be reached. We are in continuous correspondence with him. We must now await the outcome. I gather from his letter that something will be known next week. If so, the news will be conveyed through cable, so that perhaps the result will have been known by the time this article appears in print.
 Should the outcome be satisfactory, it must not be attributed to any very strong pressure applied in England, but only to our gaol- going. Anyone here can easily see this. Every white who hears of our gaol-going is struck with admiration. Voluntary submission to suffering cannot but have a powerful effect. This has been my experience again and again.
 Mr. Hajee Habib, Mr. Abdul Caadir and I were invited to Miss Smith’s. Everyone there was talking about the same thing, namely, gaol-going The very mention of gaol-going impressed people. I see the time drawing nearer every day when no one, whether black or white, will suc-ceed in obtaining a hearing by merely making petitions. If I am rig-ht,then, no force in the world can compare with soul force, that is to say, with satyagraha. I therefore wish that Indians should fill the gaols if, by the time this letter is published, there has been no decision or solution.
 On August 9, a number of Indian friends will have been released. It is my request to all of them to be fearless and go back to gaol. Let them not betray the pledge they have taken. Such is the
 
 prevailing wind all over the world; everyone, young or old, feels the call of patriotism. Much evil [often] results from this. Those who embrace satyagraha will alone be able to serve with the right kind of devotion.

             MY 	LORD,         [LONDON,]  July 	28, 1909 
  	Sir Muncherjee wrote privately to General Smuts requesting an 	interview. General Smuts has offered to send him an appointment 	after the pressure on his time is relieved. This may mean much or 	little, but, as it may also mean that General Smuts intends by 	delaying the matter to prevent a public discussion of our mission, I 	feel that the time has come to circulate our statement and let the 	authorities as also the British public know what our mission is. Sir 	Muncherjee not only agrees with this but is insistent on it, but, as 	in my letter of the 26th inst., I have expressed the contrary 	opinion, I consider it my duty to place the new phase before Your 	Lordship and request your opinion as to the desirability of 	publishing the statement. May I trouble you to send me a telegraphic 	reply.libtech_827_footnote  	I have seen Mr. Ritch’s letter about holding a Committee meeting.

            MY 	LORD,         [LONDON,]  July 	29, 1909 
  	I am extremely obliged to Your Lordship for the very great trouble 	you are taking over the Indian cause in the Transvaal which you have 	made your   own.  Immediately  on  reading  your  letterlibtech_829_footnote,  I telegraphedlibtech_830_footnotesaying that nothing would be done without 	consultation with Your Lordship and that I was writing this letter 	and sending the statementlibtech_831_footnote.  	Perhaps I should explain that most of the letters, which I would 	otherwise like to write myself, are dictated, because I write, I am 	sorry to confess, a very indifferent and illegible hand.  	My colleague and I are very pleased to find that you have been able 	to see the distinguished men whom you have mentioned in your letter.  	I am enclosing statement in proof form because, in anticipation of 	Your Lordship’s approval, it was sent to the printers yesterday, 	but it will not be published or submitted without consultation with 	Your Lordship .  	If the Act of 1907 is repealed and a promise given that six Indians 	will be admitted to the Transvaal annually in the way I have 	proposed, I would certainly be contented . . . libtech_832_footnotesimilar question was put to me by Lord Morley also. May 	I [hope that the matter will be reconsidered by the]libtech_833_footnotelibtech_834_footnoteTransvaal 	Parliament or the Provincial Council as the case may be, and that 	the Immigration Law will be amended so as to leave it open for 	Indians of great culture to enter the Transvaal under the general 	education test. The number will be limited to six, not in the law 	itself, but it will be limited or regulated by administrative 	action, that is to say, by the imposing of a severe enough test so 	that the lmmigration Officer will pass only six Indians        
 in any one year. So far as immigration is con-cerned, such Indian immigrants will be free from any measure of regis-tration or identification, their identification being the  examination,  they  will have to pass at the border. The whole position, I believe, I have clearly explained to Sir Richard Solomon and I believe, too, that he has understood it.
 There undoubtedly are other grievances in the Transvaal, as for instance, the prohibition to hold landed property, to ride in the  tramcars etc., and we will have to trouble the local authorities as also Your Lord-ship for assistance in the matter, but the  distinction between the two grie-vances which have brought the deputation to London and the others is, that the former have entailed passive resistance involving untold suffering by us, and must continue to do, so long as I can help it, until the grieva-nces are redressed or every Indian perishes in the attempt to have them re-dressed. The latter grievances are of long standing; there is no solemn  covenant  to impose upon ourselves personal suffering in order to remove them and we can wait for public opinion to mature and prejudice to die out, without reducing ourselves to penury and filling the Transvaal gaols.
 It is to me a test of Your Lordship’s very great interest [in our struggle]libtech_835_footnotelibtech_836_footnoteas also, may I say, of your high-mindedness. . .libtech_837_footnotelibtech_838_footnotepassive resistance. Will you excuse me for saying that I know of no Indian, whether here, in South Africa or in India, who had so steadily, even defiantly, set his face against sedition—as I understand it— as I have. It is part of my faith not to have anything to do with it, even at the risk of my life. Most people, that is most Indians And Anglo-Indians, express their detestation of bomb throwing and violence in words or in unreasonable action. The movement in the Transvaal, with which I have identified myself is an eloquent and standing protest in action against such methods. The test of passive resistance is self-suffering and not infliction of suffering on others. We have, therefore, not only never received a single farthing from “ the party of sedition” in India or else-where, but even if there was any offer, we should, if we were true to our principles, decline to receive it. We have hitherto made it a point not to approach the Indian public in India for financial assistance. The accounts of the British Indian Association are open to the world. A statement of income and expenditure is published from
 
 time to time and is advertised in  Indian  Opinion.libtech_839_footnotelibtech_840_footnoteMr.  Doke,  Mr. Phillipslibtech_841_footnotelibtech_842_footnote, and other notable men who are working in the Transvaal for us, know this fact most intimately. May I add, too, that the idea of passive resistance originated in South Africa was independent of any movement in India and that we have sometimes been bitterly assailed by some of our Indian friends for pinning our faith to passive resistance pure and simple?
 I hope Your Lordship will pardon me for introducing so much of the personal element, as also for the length of this letter, which was unavoidable.
 If any further elucidation or information be necessary, you can only add to the debt of gratitude to me by commanding [me to furnish the same.]libtech_843_footnote
 Mr. Ritch points out that this explanation may not be quite clear to Your Lordship. He suggests my adding:
 The Immigration Law imposes an educational test on all immigrants white or black. The severity of the test is left to the discretion of the Immigration Officer. There will not be, there is not now, the same test for all. The officer, therefore, will set one test for Europeans—and perhaps no test at all, as happens often in Natal—and another for Indians. The Courts will not interfere with such exercise of discretion.General Smuts has said that the present Immigration Law does not give so wide a discretion as this to the Immigration Officer . If that be so, the law can easily be altered to extend the measure of discretion to the necessary degree. I have already submitted through Mr. Dallow an amendment which, in my opinion, would satisfactorily effect this. Mr. Smuts did not reject my amendment, but said that he did not consider it desirable to alter the law during that session (June last). Armed with the necessary powers, the Immigration Officer need admit only six Indians under the educational test. If a seventh applied, he can plough him by imposing a test impossible for him to pass, just as is done in Australia.

            MY 	DEAR HENRY,           [LONDON,] July 30, 1909 
  	Not many visits have been paid during the last week and yet a very 	great deal of work has been done. Lord Ampthill has been doing very 	well; he was in touch with Sir George Farrar, General Smuts and Lord 	Selborne on the one hand and Lords Crewe, Morley, Lansdowne and 	Curzon on the other. He himself seems to be very hopeful. I send you 	copy of my long letterlibtech_844_footnoteto him.  	Sir Muncherji, too, wrote asking for an interview with Smuts and he 	has promised to send him an appointment as soon as pressure upon his 	time has been removed. This interview was invited when it was un- 	known what definite action Lord Ampthill was taking. Arrangements 	were also made for beginning a public campaign on a gigantic scale. 	I have it sketched out in my mind, but, in view of Lord Ampthill’s 	work, everything remains in suspension.libtech_845_footnote  	We saw Lord Morley on Monday; he gave us about half-an- hour. Sir 	Charles Lyalllibtech_846_footnotelibtech_847_footnotewas present at the interview; it was private and 	informal. He wanted to know whether the feeling in India was keen on 	the matter. I told him it was and I told him also that the reason 	why a meeting had not been held in Bombay was that  Sir  Pherozeshah 	feared violence. No one could be prevented from attending the  	meeting or from making bitter speeches. The question, in my opinion, 	shows that he is not satisfied that the feeling in India is keen, or 	rather, invites an emphatic expression of opinion from all over 	India. However, he has promised to pass on the substance of the 	interview to Lord Crewe and even to see Smuts. You will be surprised 	to learn that he did not know that General Smuts was in London, and 	he had forgotten everything about objections to the Asiatic Act.  	On your side, you should have meetings, if they will hold meet- 	ings; if not that, representations shouldlibtech_848_footnotebe sent from various bodies and, if you can get 	sufficient volunteers, you may have a brief petition         450	THE COLLECTED WORKS OF MAHATMA GANDHI 
 signed by thousands. I hope you have had the petitionslibtech_849_footnoteto Dadabhai Naoroji and the President of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce translated in the principal languages and widely distributed. In each place, if you are properly supported, you should be able to get volunteers. They should then take up these copies and distribute them. They can be posted near mosques, temples, theatres and such other places.
 I expect a cablegram from you today, after which I will hope to send you a brief cable. If, however, I do not receive one from you to- day, I may cable independently either tomorrow or Monday. Mr. Anglia and the other two arrive tomorrow. Mr. Abdul Caadir is still staying at the same hotel with us. I hope you will secure Indian directories and a suitable English-into-Gujarati and Gujarati-into- English dictionary and other books of reference or study which are not obtainable in South Africa. You may also discuss our scheme of education with Professor Gokhale; he, being a very great educationalist, may give helpful hints. You ought to be able, with Chhaganlal,libtech_850_footnotelibtech_851_footnoteto fix up an agency in Bombay, and you may be able to come   to   some   definite   understanding   with   Natesanlibtech_852_footnotelibtech_853_footnotealso    for propagating our views and ideas.
 Millie arrived on Saturday. Pater went to Southampton, but he did not return with them. They were received by Mater, Maud, Hajee Habib, Hoosen and myself. Sallie could not come because she had to attend to her business. Both Millie and Celia, as also Waldo and baby, were looking very nice. I think they look all the better for the voyage. They had a good time on board. Celia went to find Amy and then directly went to the apartments; Millie came to the hotel with baby, as the arrange-ment was that Celia should come with Amy to the hotel, but she, in her excitement, did not take in the name of the hotel where  I am staying and went to Hotel Cecil and, afterwards, directly to the apartments. Waldo has a slight touch of cold, nothing serious about it.
 There was an at-home at Miss Smith’s; Millie and Maud were there. I think both of them enjoyed it; it was rather good and there
 
the indian Review
 
 was good company. There were a few Indian ladies also. Millie became chummy with one of them—Mrs. Dube. She is Hindustani though she was partly brought up in Bombay; she speaks English very nicely. Millie will come into closer contact with her.
 She does not like the apartments she is in and will probably take a small house partly furnished, either in Cricklewood or near Kew. I have suggested to her that she should have Hoosen with her; it would be mutually satisfactory. Hoosen is going on splendidly;  a  better  youth it will be difficult to find, but he is somewhat dreamy, he has not the go that I should expect a youth of his age to have and does not give himself enough exercise, but, as he is not self-willed,he will easily accept a gentle guidance from Millie, with whom I have discussed what should be done for him. Amy is also staying with Millie. I understand that Amy has grown wonderfully, but she is not a steady girl and she causes some anxiety to Millie. I sent a cablegramlibtech_854_footnoteon Monday to Daphtary, Moralitylibtech_855_footnotelibtech_856_footnoteand the Presidency Associationlibtech_857_footnoteregarding you. I am curious to know whether the cablegrams were acted upon.
 I attended a great suffragette meeting last night; met Mrs. Pankhurstlibtech_858_footnotealso. I am sending you their weekly  Votes for Women.  We have a great deal to learn from these ladies and their movement. I have other pamphlets which I thought I would send on to you, but, on second thoughts, I should send them to Johannesburg or Phoenix. I will get another set for you; you will then have it next week.
 Mrs. Ritch’s progress continues to be steady. This time I hardly think there can be any relapse.

        NATAL 	DELEGATES    Friday, 	July 30, 1909 
  	The Natal delegates will arrive here tomorrow morning. Some of us 	have made preparations to go and receive them.  SUFFRAGETTES  	Mr. Abdul Caadir, Mr. Hajee Habib and I attended a suffragette 	meeting. The St. James’ Hall was crowded to capacity by the women 	attending the meeting. According to Mr. Hajee Habib’s estimate, 	there must have been about 1,500 persons, including men and women.  	Such meetings are held almost every week. A collection is made at 	every meeting, and at least £50 are received.  At  yesterday’s 	meeting, it was £100. The meeting was held to honour some ladies 	who had been released from gaol. There were fourteen of them. They 	were  	presented silver medals. A dinner has also been arranged for them, 	for which tickets at one shilling each have been issued.  	The meeting was presided over by a lady named Mrs. Lawrence. All the 	speakers were women. All the arrangements were also made by them.  	Among those who had been to gaol, there were three or four who were 	mere girls of twenty or so. All of them had been arrested in the 	course of the campaign for the franchise.  According  to  the 	practice here, the prisoners are placed in different classes. These 	women were awarded second class. It is their demand that they should 	be treated as firstclass prisoners. As the Government did not 	concede it, they resolved collecti-vely to disobey the gaol 	regulations. They broke the windows of prison cells and refused to 	submit to any of the regulations. In consequence, they were confined 	in dark cells. There, too, they disregarded the gaolers’ orders. 	At last, all the women stopped taking food. One of them ate nothing 	for six days, some others for five days. In this way, everyone 	fasted. The Government felt helpless in the end and let them off. 	The women feel disappointed at this, and have declared that they 	will continue to go to gaol till all women like them are treated as 	first class prisoners. At this very meeting, the police served 	summonses on two of the women who had 
 been released, to answer a charge of having com-mitted an assault while in gaol. The serving of the summonses was received with thunderous applause in the Hall. When we consider the suffering and the courage of these women, how can the Indian satyagrahis stand comparison with them?
 Their Association brings out a weekly of its own. It has a sale of 50,000,  and  a  copy  costs  a  penny.   The   contributorslibtech_859_footnoteare   mostly women. Every week some women come forward as volunteers to go round selling copies. They receive no remuneration. Though all these ladies belong to good families, they are not ashamed of doing this work, but rather take pride in it. All of them turn out with ribbons on their shoulders bearing the words “ Votes for Women” printed on them.
 Besides bringing out this weekly, they have also published a number of other pamphlets. There are some women who, having offered their all in the service of this cause, now exert themselves physically. Some are highly educated women.
They collect £3,000 in a year. They aim at collecting a total of
£20,000.
 Their campaign has been going on for nearly five years. Its founda-tions were laid a good many years ago, but it is during the last five years that they have been going to gaol in order to exert pressure. During this period, nearly 500 women have suffered imprisonment. Some of them have been to gaol more than once. All the [Association’s] office-bearers have been to gaol. They employ every means to get themselves imprisoned.
 So many years have passed, but they do not yield. They grow stronger every day. They think out new ways of harassing the Government, and some of the women have dedicated themselves entirely to this cause. Some are ready to die. They have taken  a pledge that they must win. They would meet death rather than betray the pledge, so great is their spirit of determination.
 The systematic way in which they set about their work and their skill deserve the highest commendation. Their enthusiasm is unbounded. A great many men have been struck with admiration to see all this.
Let Indians ask themselves whether it is anything to wonder at
 
 that we, in the Transvaal, have to wait a long time [for redress], have to suffer, fall ill in gaol or go hungry, even face death, when the British women have failed to get redress for such a long time and have to go through such suffering. Mrs. Lawrence, who has contributed large amounts of money to this campaign and who has been to gaol herself, says: “There can be no building for progress unless—in the case of every reform or scheme of human good—some men do the building with their blood.”
 These words should be pondered over by every lover of India. If we want freedom, we shall not gain it by killing or injuring others (i.e.,by the use of brute force) but by dying or submitting ourselves to suffering (i.e., by the use of soul force). The Transvaal struggle is for the defence of our honour, that is, for freedom. To lay down one’s life to achieve this is as good as remaining alive. To go on living without it is no better than being dead. We have much to learn from the suffragettes. No doubt we may find some faults in them, but we need not enlarge upon the matter here.

 LONDON,
  THE 	EDITOR THE 	ENGLISHMAN [CALCUTTA] SIR, August 	3, 1909 
  	Your correspondent “South African” has packed so much ignora-nce 	into the letter published by you in your issue of the 21st ultimo, 	that he had need to conceal his identity,. May I correct a few of 	his misstatements?  	Mr. L. W. Ritch, though he calls me his friend and colleague, is 	not—as your correspondent assumes—an Indian. He is an English 	Jew and is at present practising as a barrister.  	The registration of Indians is a measure of identification, 	impugn-ing the honesty of Indians as a class. The pass system with 	reference to the Kaffirs is somewhat of a taxing measure and in no 	way insulting in the same sense that the Asiatic Registration Act of 	1907 is. There is as much difference between the Asiatic 	Registration Act and the Continental Passport system as there is 	between chalk and cheese. The Continental Passport is a protection 	to the holder and the non-holding of it does not make him a criminal 	and liable to imprisonment with hard labour up to six months, 	whereas the non- holding of registration certificates under the 	Asiatic Act by British Indians has sent already 2,500 Indians to 	gaol in the Transvaal. There are no Indian coolies in the Transvaal.  	The Indian trading community in Natal—notwithstanding your 	correspondent’s statement to the contrary—had no part in shaping 	the legislation in connection with the introduction of indentured 	Indian labour into that Colony.  	Your correspondent’s fiction is that every Indian in Natal lives 	at a cost of 10/- per month and a hut made of old tin linings of 	cases, whereas the fact, according to the borough valuation of 	Durban, is that the Indians hold substantial properties in that 	place, valued at nearly a million pounds, and that this very fact 	has been used against them by their European competitors in trade. In 	one thing, however, the Indians can join hands with  your 
 correspondent, and that is in his denunciation of the existence of indentured labour in Natal or in any part of South Africa. British Indians have been,for the past fifteen years, agitating for abolition of that   form   of   labour,   which   the   late   Sir   William  Wilson   Hunterlibtech_863_footnotedescribed as perilously near to slavery.

           MY 	LORD,         [LONDON,]  August 	4, 1909 
  	I have to thank you very much for your letter of the 3rd inst., and 	for the valuable suggestions made by you with reference to the 	statementlibtech_864_footnote  	I know how hard pressed the authorities are with work and, knowing 	that you lose no opportunity of bringing the question home to them, 	both Mr.Hajee Habib and I are content to wait.  	Your Lordship‘s question was whether passive resistance was 	financed or fomented from India. As to the “fomenting”, I did 	not go into details; I very nearly did so and then refrained for 	fear of making my letter too long and burdensome, but, as you have 	kindly invited me to express myself more fully, I gladly avail 	myself of the opportunity. I am fully aware of the allegation that 	we are acting in co-operation with the Extremist Party in India.libtech_865_footnotelibtech_866_footnoteI 	however give Your Lordship the emphatic assurance that the charge is 	totally without foundation. Indian passive resistance in the 	Transvaal had its rise in that Colony and has been continued 	absolutely independent of anything that is being said or done in 	India; indeed, sometimes, even in defiance of what has been said or 	written to the contrary in India or elsewhere. Our movement is 	absolutely unconnected with any ex- [tremist movement in] India. I 	do not know the extremists per

We are also in close touch with the Editor of The Times of India and I used to be in personal touch with the late Mr. Saunderslibtech_871_footnotelibtech_872_footnoteof  The Englishman who,  I  may  say,  gave  me  most valuable assistance and advice when I first undertook public work in South Africa. Our complaint has always been that our countrymen in India have, as it might have appeared until recently, almost studiously ignored the question of its Imperial importance. The greatest prominence has been given to it by the suicidal action of General Smuts in having forcibly deported innocent Indians, in most cases penniless, from the Transvaal through the Portuguese territories to India. This has advertized the cause as perhaps nothing else has done, and now Mr. Henry S. L. Polak is in Bombay, from the Transvaal, in order to place the position before the Indian public. He has gone there with definite instructions not to come into touch with the Extremist Party, but to be guided largely by the Editor of The Times of India,Professor Gokhale and the Aga Khan.
 What I mean by passive resistance will appear somewhat more clearly from the enclosed cuttinglibtech_873_footnote, which gives a summary of   my address to the Germiston Literary and Debating Society.libtech_874_footnoteGermiston, I may say, is seething with anti-Indian feeling. Yet the members of that society, including the Mayor of Germiston, were good enough to recognise that the fight we are carrying on is perfectly clean.
 It would be improper for me not to add that I follow what is going on in India with the keenest interest and some of the [phases] of the  [nat]ional  movement  with  the  gravest  anxiety.  With  …libtech_875_footnotelibtech_876_footnote[sym] pathy,   and   by   …libtech_877_footnotepeople   and   my   countrymen   is   fraught   with advantages to both and also to the world. I believe, too, that the fullest expansion of national sentiment is quite consistent with the stability of British rule in India and I further believe that much of what we suffer in India is easy of remedy by effort from within. I know that under
 
 the British constitution, British subjects, no matter to what race they belong, have never got and never can get their rights until they have performed their corresponding duties and until they are willing to fight for them. The fight takes the form either of physical violence, as in the case of the extremists in India, or of personal suffering by the fighters, as in the case of our passive resisters in the Transvaal. In my opinion, the first form of seeking redress is largely barbarous and, in any case, inconsistent with the genius of the people of India,  no because they are physically too weak to take that course, but because their training has adapted them to the latter mode, and I am free to confess that passive resistance in the Transvaal is a practical demonstration to the party of violence in India that they are entirely on the wrong track and that, so long as they pin their faith to violence for obtaining relief of any kind whatsoever, so long are they beating the air.
 I am quite aware that this exposition of my own view may not be of any use to Your Lordship and possibly is devoid of any interest whatsoever. The only reason why I mention it is to guard myself against being misunderstood.libtech_878_footnoteI  am  most  anxious  not  to  withhold anything at all from Your Lordship and I am anxious also to retain, in any work that I undertake, the support of one who so loves the Empire and the country of my birth as yourself.
 With many thanks for the deep interest you are taking in our troubles and with apologies for the unavoidable length of this letter.

APPENDICES
 
 APPENDIX I
 GENERAL SMUTS’SPEECH IN RICHMOND
 The following is a condensation of the speech.
 [February 5, 1908] In 1906, when the Government felt it right to put a stop to [the stream of immigrants,] .  .  .  a  law was introduced in the Legislative Council and passed. The
object was to register in the most unmistakable way . . . every Asiatic who was
legally entitled to be here.       to give a definite status to the Indians who were here
before the war and to see that the rest of Asia was kept out of the country       the
Home Government would not assent to the law.
 The first Parliament of the Transvaal met in March last and unanimously approved of [a similar bill and] it was assented to . . . .
 The lawlibtech_879_footnoteproposed that the Government should notify a period within which Asiatics [were to] register themselves.	Of the 10,000 Indians in the country only
500 registered. . . .
 Three alternatives remained . . . put them over the border;	they could have
sent them all to prison; .  .  .  or [go] to Parliament again      It was not easy  putting
 men over the border. It was not a question for the Transvaal alone [Natal, Orange River Colony and Rhodesia having refused to admit “coolies”,] but an international question.    The next alternative was to put the Indians in prison. He had sent every
 leader to prison, and hundreds more and it had had no impression. The policy of imprisonment was a very good policy as a threat, but       he defied any government to
take 10,000 men by the collar and put them in prison here. . . .
 [Imprisonment] was a course which was not only physically but morally impossible,	because it  would injure the reputation and prestige of  the white
people of the Transvaal       The law of 1885 [too had] become a dead letter, and the
result was that from 1885 to 1899 the Asiatics       paid no [fees for] licences and they
did not bother about the laws       He wanted, by hook or by crook, to carry out the
 object of the law. He held out the olive branch. He told them that the law had expired, but that the Government would take their voluntary registration and lay it before Parliament  .   .   .   [The  Indian   leaders]   accepted the   suggestion	voluntary
 registration was the only course open. So he said “All right”, because there was nothing dishonourable to the Government in that       the position he took up from
 the start was that any means of identification for the Indian population of the Transvaal other than the 10 finger-prints was insufficient       The Indians said they
 
 
 would never submit to that . . . they had now submitted, . . . they had learned more wisdom, and had seen that it was not criminal and not dishonourable . . . The Indians’ second contention was that they would never register until the law had been repealed, that the law was an indignity and disgrace. He had told them that the law would not be repealed so long as there was an Asiatic in the country who had not registered, and like wise men the leaders of the Indian community had waived the question of repeal .
 . . What could never be done by the Republican Government had now been done by a little give and take on both sides, and he thought the settlement was honourable to both sides . . . They had passed two laws . . . One was to register all the Indians who were here legally; the other was to close the door finally on the others . . .
 No Asiatic in future could come into this country unless he was a resident of the Transvaal before the war. The British Government had assented to this . . . it was the most drastic Asiatic Law that had ever been passed in the British Empire, . . . They knew that they belonged to a largely black Empire and that was a fact they must never forget . . .

 APPENDIX III
 GENERAL SMUTS’SPEECH IN LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLYlibtech_880_footnote
 [PRETORIA,
 August 21, 1908]
 “ . . . Hon. Members will remember that under the Crown Colony Government of 1906 a law was passed, which, however, failed to carry the assent of His Majesty the King and in March, 1907, the law . . . was passed without any alterations by the Legislature of the Transvaal. That law came into force last year. . . Different dates were proclaimed . . . under it for the registration of Asiatics in this country, but . . . the Asiatics organized a movement of passive resistance, and registration under that law proved . . . a failure. not more than 600 had registered by the time that the
dates for registration expired, which was June 30 of last year.	That was a very
 awkward and, in some senses, a very dangerous state of affairs. There is no more awkward position for a Government than a movement of passive resistance. It is a movement which is really tantamount to an act of war, and really amounts to a state of anarchy so far as the Government is concerned. In more primitive times one would have met it by simply issuing a declaration of war.... I did my best     to carry out the
law ... and as a result early this year many Asiatics were languishing in prisons . . .
 finally I met some of the leaders of the Asiatic community and discussed the question with them, and the result was that, pending the meeting of this House, temporary
 
 
 arrangements were made . . . that voluntary registration should take place of all Asiatics who are legally resident in the country, and that the matter should be brought for ratification before this House. up to date practically every Asiatic in the country
... has made application for registration.... the applications numbered 9,158       [Of
 these] 7,773 have been recognized as legal residents, and certificates of registration have been issued to them; 1,214 applications have been rejected .... The small number of 171 applications have not yet been decided. ... there has  been  no substantial objection to  the giving of  finger-prints. (Hear! hear!)       7,010 gave
finger-prints; 1,960 gave the two thumbs.... Only 70 declined to give finger-prints. .
.  .  Hon. Members will accordingly see that the impression       that the  principal
 difficulty centred around ... the finger-prints was not correct.... The principal objection was to the law itself.... charges have been levelled against me by
prominent Indians that the terms of the compromise were not kept, that       there was
a promise that the Act should be repealed, and that I have not kept that promise....
 That compact has been carried out to the letter. The Asiatic leaders, in a letter of the 28th of January, issued from the Johannesburg Gaol, made the following offer in a petition. They say: “Our opposition has never been directed so much against the finger-print requirements.     “ Then there is some reference to the relaxation of the
 finger-prints. This offer was accepted by me, and from it two questions have arisen: the first whether the permission was given to repeal the Act. I do not think that any court of law could put such an interpretation on my promise. The consequence was that an Asiatic who registered voluntarily could do so under another Act, and not under Act 2 [of 1907]. The Asiatics took the matter to the [Supreme] Court, and Sir William Solomon took the view that the interpretation of the agreement was entirely different from the construction which the Asiatics placed upon it. Well, Sir, it was then stated that, although this correspondence contained no compromise to repeal tile Act, yet in interviews which I had with Mr. Gandhi, I promised to repeal it. That is not so, and the impression may be the result of a misconception.    The second difficulty arose in
 consequence of the provision that voluntary registration should also apply to those Asiatics who . . . were out of the Colony but who were entitled . . . to return       My
 answer . . . was that there was a compromise made for a specific period—three months—pending the meeting of Parliament. I could not promise that       at a future
date Asiatics coming into this country should be left to register as they wished ....
 further difficulties arose on two points. One point was the entry of these people after the period of the compromise expired, and the other was the contention of the Asiatic leaders that under the Immigration Act as framed last year educated Asiatics were entitled to enter the country.    provision should be made whereby Asiatics who could
pass a slight education test under the Immigration Act should be allowed to       enter
 the country. That is a view of the law and a policy that I could never admit. (Hear! hear!)       Large numbers of people who otherwise were undesirable would be free to
 enter the country, and that I would never allow. Then the passive resistance movement started once more. Meetings were held, speeches of an inflammatory character were made, certificates were burned       I think it was really unnecessary. I
 intended to stick to the letter of the arrangement I had made with the Asiatics, and in consequence a Bill was published . . . to validate these voluntary registrations . . .
public feeling in the country was already very strong, and I consulted       with Hon.
Members   of  the  House to  see  what would be  the  best way  of  arranging the
 difficulties . . . the suggestion was made that we should come together with some prominent members of the Asiatic [community] and discuss the difficulties. We met them . . . and I think this Bill does fairly and reasonably meet every objection and every difficulty . . . with the exception of one—and that is the difficulty . . . in connection with the educated Asiatics. They put the difficulties in this way— that water Act 2, 1907 . . . Turkish Mahomedans, subjects of the Turkish Empire, were excluded from this country. It was urged that that was . . . casting a slur and stigma on the Mahomedan religion .  .  .  That objection .  .  .  we have met.     The next point
 refers to the Asiatics who were resident in the Transvaal before the war, but who do not fall within the terms of the law of last year, which mentioned two tests for Indians
. . . Either they [were] required to have the Peace Preservation permit       or had to be
in this country on May 31, 1902       Hon. Members will see a provision in the Bill
 that, if Asiatics were residents in the country three years before the war, and they can prove that, then it is competent for them to apply within a year       for certificates of
registration. . . . The third difficulty . . . referred to children.       it was necessary that
 not only the adult males, but also minors between the ages of eight years and sixteen years should register       The third innovation made in the Bill-that minors below the
 age of sixteen shall not be required to have certificates of registration, but shall be taken up in the certificates of their parent. The next point raised was in reference to the appeal       to the Magistrates in case the Registrar of Asiatics refused to recognize
[claims] .  .  .  The Asiatic leaders argued       that a different practice obtained in
different courts of Resident Magistrates.       This had been met by another alteration
in the Bill,       the Government will assign one special Magistrate to hear all cases of
appeals. .  .  .  One  other point was  raised     when Asiatics make application for
licences        [they] give their thumb-prints as a  means of identification; but it  has
been pointed out [that] . . . some Asiatics are well known.       others well educated
and can sign their names       and it is unnecessary to lay down a hard and fast rule. If
 the signature is a sufficient means of identification, let us accept the signature. If that   is not sufficient, let us adopt such other measures as may be necessary to meet the case. Hon. Members will see that that recommendation has been embodied in this
Bill . . . a liquor clause       which exempted Asiatics from the Liquor Act [has at their
instance] disappeared from this Bill. There is       provision for the transfer of certain
property into the name of the heirs of an Indian .  .  .  it was very strongly urged .  .  .
that we should open the door . . . to the educated Asiatics . . . I have not felt       that
any departure should be made        after all these points were urged upon us and we had
 met them fairly in this Bill, there was every ground to expect some settlement, or some abatement of this storm which is going on in this country; but my secretary has received today a letter from the leaders of the Asiatic Committee which shows that that hope, which was entirely reasonable, is very likely to be disappointed.       The
 other provisions are: All prisoners to be discharged; Asiatic Act to be repealed; general education test . . . with free issue of the burned certificates. (Laughter.) . . .
 Mr. Gandhi has referred to Indians being in partnership with the white population of this country. .  .  .  It is a  claim       which this white population will never  allow.
(Sustained cheers.) . . .

APPENDIX V
 SPEECHES IN HOUSE OF LORDS ON TRANSVAAL INDIAN SITUATION BY LORDS AMPTHILL AND CURZON
 The following are extracts from the Times report of Lord Ampthill’s speech in a Debate in the House of Lords on February 4, 1908:
 Lord Ampthill said he had given notice ‘to call attention to the treatment of British Indians in the Transvaal, and to move for papers’, and he thought that, in spite of the altered circumstances of the case, it was desirable that the compromise arrived at should not pass unnoticed in Parliament. He was sure the House would be willing to congratulate the Transvaal Government on their courageous and statesmanlike action... He thought they might also congratulate the Indian natives in the Transvaal, because the courage, unity and consistency with which they had
 pursued their end were not less admirable than the moderation and modesty with which they had put forward their demands... No one ... acquainted with the subject could doubt that the Indians were reasonable in their objections to these regulations      but
 he blamed His Majesty’s Government for having allowed the situation to reach such an alarming pitch.     Thus far the only explanation they had received from members
 of the Government was that it was impossible to interfere with a self-governing colony. He protested against the misuse of the word interfere; for if by interference was meant the insistence by the Mother Country on the rights of individual citizens of the Empire, we were as much justified in interfering with a self-governing colony as we were in interfering with foreign nations in such case, as we often did.    why,
 then, was Indian slavery ignored? He used the term advisedly, for members of the Government and their supporters had defined as marks of slavery identification by finger-prints, inability  to   hold   fixed   property,   and  relegation  to  Compounds...
 Nobody denied the right of the Colonists to manage their own affairs, but they must remember that they were partners in a great Empire and that their interests must not be pursued in such a manner as to injure the other partners.
 We had a right to insist that the Imperial point of view should be considered; and the Imperial point of view required that for the safety and honour of the Empire British citizens, whatever their colour, should be treated as such. British citizens ought not to be oppressed and degraded     If the Colonies were inadvertently to get us
 into trouble with India, they would do us as much, or even more, harm than if they got us into trouble with foreign nations.    Therefore, it was the business of Imperial
 statesmanship to explain these considerations to the Colonies. Why was this not done at the Imperial Conference last summer, when all the Colonial Premiers were here? .... As to the registration of finger-prints, why did not His Majesty’s Government refer to the Indian Government and ask what system was adopted there? Instead of that, they allowed the Transvaal Government to tell them what they thought the practice was in India; and the Transvaal Government told them wrong ...
 In India the thumb and forefinger of the left hand only were registered; the ten-finger system was confined in India to criminals alone      The attitude of His Majesty’s
 Government was, first, timorous protest, and then reluctant assent to all that the Colonies did.
 EXTRACTS FROM LORD CURZON’S SPEECH
 
 The question came before us in India in a twofold aspect in relation both to Natal and the Transvaal. The Government of Natal...sent a deputation.	to ask us to
agree to the repatriation of [indentured] labourers... We were willing.	provided we
could. .  .  secure the relaxation of the hardships.... under which  the free.	Indian
population of Natal then laboured.	the Natal Government declined to accept  our
proposals....Your Lordships are all aware of the cruel and disabling restrictions...
 placed upon the Indian population in [the Transvaal]. They were one of the.. causes of the war. As soon as the war was over we felt it our duty.	to address the then  Secretary
of State upon the subject .... A little later Lord Milner came to us with a request.	for
10,000 and afterwards.	20,000 [Indians] to inaugurate railway labour in the new
 possessions .... We agreed.. and once again. used the position to endeavour to get
better terms for the free Indians in the Transvaal. I am sorry to say that we failed.
 .... [the compromise] is one that seems.... honourable to both parties.	the
 Bluebook.... leaves a rather disagreeable taste in the mouth.... [The Transvaal Government] rushed through their anti-Indian legislation with...almost indecent speed. Secondly, there was failure.   on the part of General Botha to act up to the
 undertaking....to find some method of identification superior to that of finger-impressions.... (Hear! Hear!) the system and method of finger-impressions
that were proposed in the Transvaal were undoubtedly humiliating .... Then.   there
was a failure on the part of the Transvaal Government to distinguish....between....
Indians of good social status and refined education and the Indians of lower class....
 whose competition really had to be feared. That is the charge.. which we are justified in bringing against the authorities in the Transvaal Well, we have now arrived at a
 settlement of the question; but I imagine that His Majesty’s Government will be the last to argue that that temporary settlement is a final settlement of the question. I am sure that your lordships realize that this question is in reality about the most momentous and the most far-reaching which could possibly confront any body of statesmen.
 Let me.... state to  your lordships... the Indian point  of view.	the Indian
 coolie. . .sees that [he is] invited and even encouraged by our Government to emigrate.  to  a  colony which he  enriches by  his  labour, and  then society there
 appears to turn round upon him and treat him as if he were a pariah dog. He is penalized there, not for his vices, but for his virtues.. . And then the  Indian remembers that...he has fought for the British Empire.. and that it was largely owing to his efforts that Natal was saved .... Now.  he claims the full rights of citizenship of
the British Empire. I do not think it is for us to blame him for that       it is, after all,
 the only basis upon which you will expect the loyalty of an Asiatic population to an alien rule to be permanently developed or maintained. . . .
 ....The colonial point of  view is  entirely different .... I  realize that.	in a
way, it is quite unanswerable.   if [the Colonist] is selfish it is only in the pursuit
of....self- preservation .... He declines to acquiesce in any system which will mean...
 a permanent lowering of the standard of life, and he feels...the danger of being confronted with an enormous black problem...and...a  great  brown  problem as well...it appears that you have two forces.   pulling in opposite directions within the
framework of the same Empire ....
 In these circumstances what is the duty of the Government?...They can endeavour. . . to reconcile these opposing factors and principles. . . and anyhow . . .
endeavour to  work that there should be... no  clash... between that      In the first
place they can so see.     that fair terms are invariably secured for the labourer or the
emigrant when he goes out.  and, should his return be desired, for his return when it is
 to come about. It is for the Government to see that a good bargain is made for its own subjects. . .and       the bargain once made, to see that the terms are not hastily or
rashly altered at a later date to the detriment of the man....Then.  the Government
 ought to see that the restrictions imposed upon Asiatics are made as little vexatious as possible....Then .. .they ought to see that nowhere shall occur  the  painful situation of Indian gentlemen ...of character, respectability, and education, being treated as if they were common coolies...and herded together...with men of very much lower  status  and occupation than themselves.	(  Cheers. )        There is
 another suggestion which has been made—namely, that the Government should try to discover.  some other field of emigration to which our Indian fellow-subjects may go,
free from the disabilities and restrictions to which I have alluded.   for my own part, it
 is one which I do not look upon with quite so much favour as some of the authorities who have taken it up. In any case I hope that the recent proceedings which have culminated in the victory...for our Indian fellow subjects .  .  .  may read a  lesson. . .
 both to the Government of the Colony and to the Government which sits on the bench—a lesson to the Government of the Colony that it cannot afford to treat without the utmost consideration the rights of these immigrants. ; a lesson to His Majesty’s Government that they owe a duty just as great to the dusky millions of India as they owe to the white people of their own race in any colony of the British Crown. (Cheers.)

 PART II

 An 	Asiatic shall be 	entitled to 	registration under this 	Act if—   he 		satisfies the 		conditions described in 		sub-sections (2) 		or (3) 		of Section 		four, whether 		he was or was not in 		this Colony 		at the  
 
 commencement of this Act; or
   being 		the lawful holder of 		a certificate 		of registration 		issued under Act 		No. 2 of 1907, he 		desires to 		exchange such 		certificate for a 		certificate of 		registration under this 		Act; or  having 		been a minor 		resident in 		this Colony at 		the commencement 		of this 		Act, he first 		entered the Colony 		with an adult 		Asiatic who was his 		guardian and who was 		registered under Law No. 		3 of 1885 or 		any amendment 		thereof or is registered 		or entitled 		to registration 		under this 		Act; or  he 		was born 		in any 		part of 		South Africa which was 		at the 		date of 		his birth 		within the boundaries 		of the Transvaal.   (1) 	Every unregistered adult Asiatic 	resident in this 	Colony at 	the commencement 	of this 	Act shall 	before such date or dates 	and at such 	place or places 	and to 	such person 	or persons 	as the 	Colonial Secretary may 	by notice 	in the 	Gazette prescribe 	for particular 	areas of this 	Colony, make 	application for registration, 	and the registrar 	shall, on being 	satisfied that such 	Asiatic is 	entitled to registration, issue to him a certificate of registration. 
  Every 	unregistered adult 	Asiatic resident outside 	the Colony 	at the 	commencement of 	this Act, shall, 
  if 	he was resident 	in the 	Transvaal for three years prior 	to the 	eleventh day 	of October 1899; and  upon 	application for 	registration from 	a place 	in South 	Africa but outside 	the Colony 	within one year after 	the commencement 	of this 	Act; and  upon 	satisfying the 	registrar of 	the facts 	mentioned in 	this sub- section: be entitled to obtain a certificate of registration.

 MINOR ASIATICS
  In 	respect of 	every unregistered 	minor Asiatic 	born in 	this Colony, 	not being 	the child of a labourer 	introduced into this 	Colony  under  the  	Labour Importation 	Ordinance 1904, the 	following provisions 	shall apply: 
  If 	his guardian 	is an Asiatic, 	the minor’s 	name, his age, 	his residence 	and his relationship 	to his 	guardian shall 	be included in the 	certificate  of registration 	of his guardian.  Within 	one month 	after such minor attains the 	age of sixteen 	years,he shall 	make application 	to the registrar 	for a certificate  of  	registration; provided 	that, if 	he be absent from the 	Colony on 	attaining that 	age or 	one month thereafter, he 	may, from a 	place in 	South Africa but 	outside the 	Colony, make 	application to 	the registrar 	for registration 	and upon satisfying 	the registrar that 	he is entitled 	to registration, 	the registrar 	shall issue to 	him a 	certificate of 	registration, and 	his name shall thereupon 	be expunged 	from the register 	of Asiatics 	as a minor 	and shall 	be deemed 	to be no longer 	included in his 	guardian’s certificate 	of registration. 
  (1) 	Whenever the 	registrar is 	satisfied that 	any Asiatic 	claiming to be 	entitled to 	registration under 	Section three  is 	not so 	entitled, he 	shall refuse 	 to issue 	to him 	a certificate 	of registration, 	and notice 	of the 	refusal shall 	be sent by post to such Asiatic at the address given upon his form of application. 
   In 		every case 		of refusal 		by the 		registrar to 		issue a certificate of 		registration, an 		appeal may, 		within fourteen days 		of the 		date of the 		notice of 		refusal, he 		noted by 		letter addressed to 		the Colonial Secretary, 		and such 		appeal shall 		be heard 		by a magistrate 		specially assigned by 		the Governor to 		hear such 		appeals, and such 		magistrate shall be 		deemed, when hearing any 		such appeal, 		to be an inferior 		court within 		the meaning 		of Section 		nineteen of 		the Administration 		of Justice 		Proclamation 1902.  In 		the case 		of an Asiatic 		who is 		in South Africa but 		outside this 		Colony, the 		officer in 		charge of 		the Immigration 		Department shall, as 		soon as 		the date 		has been 		fixed for the hearing 		of such 		appeal, send by post 		to the 		appellant at 		the address given upon 		his application 		for registration 		 a temporary 		permit entitling 		him to 		enter and 		remain in 		the Colony 		until the appeal 		has been determined. 		If the 		appeal be 		dismissed, the 		said magistrate shall 		make an order 		in writing 		directing the appellant 		to be removed 		from the Colony, 		and every 		such order 		shall be deemed 		to be an 		order made under Section 		six of 		the Immigrants’ 		Restriction Act 1907 		or any 		amendment thereof.  In 		the case 		of an adult 		Asiatic in 		the Colony 		who has not within 		a period 		prescribed by 		sub-section (2) 		of this 		section noted an 		appeal or 		whose appeal 		having been noted has 		not been proceeded with 		or has 		been dismissed, 		the said magistrate shall make an order in writing directing such Asiatic to be  
 
 removed from the Colony, and every such order shall be deemed to be an order made under Section six of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act 1907 or any amendment thereof.
 
 REMOVAL FROM THE COLONY
  Any 	adult Asiatic who, after 	such date or dates 	as may 	be notified 	by the 	Colonial Secretary in 	the Gazette, is 	found within the 	Colony and 	fails, upon such 	demand as 	is mentioned in 	Section nine, 	to produce 	a certificate 	of registration 	of which 	he is the 	lawful holder, may 	be arrested 	without warrant and 	brought before a 	resident or 	assistant resident 	magistrate and if 	he fails to 	satisfy such magistrate 	that he 	is the lawful 	holder of a certificate 	of registration 	or that 	the time 	within which he  is 	required to 	make application 	for such 	certificate has 	not expired the 	magistrate shall, 	save as in the 	next succeeding 	section is provided, 	make an 	order in 	writing directing him to be removed from this  Colony and every order shall be deemed to be 
an order under Section six  of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act 1907 or any amendment
thereof.
  If 	an adult Asiatic who 	has failed to 	make application 	for registration 	in accordance 	with the provisions 	of sub-sections 	(1) of 	Section four 	shall satisfy the 	magistrate before 	whom he is brought 	that such failureness 	due to 	some good and 	sufficient cause, the 	magistrate may, instead 	of making 	such order as aforesaid, 	direct such Asiatic 	forthwith to make 	application for 	registration within eight 	days, and if 	such Asiatic shall 	comply with 	such direction, his 	application shall 	be dealt 	with in all 	respects as 	if it had been made in 	accordance with 	the provisions of 	the said sub- 	section and 	all the provisions of 	this Act 	which would have applied 	if the 	application had been so 	made shall apply 	accordingly, but, 	if he shall 	fail to comply 	with such 	directions, the magistrate shall make an order for removal as aforesaid in respect of 
such Asiatic and any such order shall be deemed to be an order made under Section six
of the Immigrants’ Restriction Act 1907 or any amendment thereof.
 Part III
 GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS
 
  Every 	Asiatic who enters 	or is within 	this Colony shall, upon demand 	made upon him by any 	European member of a police force lawfully established therein  or 	by any other 	European person 	authorised thereto 	by the Colonial 	Secretary, produce the 	certificate of 	registration of 	which he 	is the lawful 	holder, and shall 	also on 	like demand 	supply such particulars 	and furnish 	such means of 	identification as 	may be prescribed 	by regulation. 	Any Asiatic 	who fails 	upon lawful 	demand to produce 	such certificate 	shall, unless he is the 	lawful holder of a certificate of registration, be liable to be dealt with in manner mentioned in Section eight.  (1) 	If at any 	time any certificate of 	registration is 	lost or 	destroyed, the 	person to 	whom it 	was issued 	shall forthwith apply to 	the registrar 	to have 	the same renewed and the registrar shall, upon compliance by such person with 
 such procedure as is prescribed by regulation and upon payment of a fee of five shillings, renew the certificate. Such fee shall be denoted by means of revenue stamps to be affixed to the application for renewal and shall be defaced by the said registrar.
 (2) Any person into whose hands shall have come any such certificate shall, unless he is the person to whom it was issued, forthwith deliver or transmit the same as soon as may be to the Registrar of Asiatics, Pretoria.
  Every 	certificate of 	registration shall be 	accepted as 	conclusive evidence 	in all 	places that 	the lawful 	holder thereof is 	entitled to 	enter and 	reside in 	this Colony; 	provided that this 	section shall 	not apply 	to persons 	who have, 	under Section 	five or 	six of 	the Immigrants’ 	Restriction Act 1907 	or any 	amendment thereof, been 	removed from the Colony.  Whenever, 	in any 	prosecution or 	other proceeding under 	this Act the age 	of any Asiatic 	is in question 	such Asiatic shall unless and 	until the 	contrary be 	proved be 	taken to 	be of the age which 	the registrar 	shall in any 	certificate issued under 	his hand certify to be in his opinion the apparent age of such Asiatic.  Any 	affidavit or 	sworn declaration which 	is required 	by regulation 	to be 	made by 	any person 	who makes 	an application 	for registration 	shall be exempt 	from stamp duty. 
 TRADING LICENCES
 
  (1) 	No Asiatic shall 	obtain any 	trading licence under 	the Revenue  Licences 	Ordinance 1905 or 	any amendment 	thereof or under 	any bye-law 	or regulation 	in force 	within the jurisdiction 	of a 	local authority, 	unless he 	produce to 	the person 	appointed to issue 	the licence a 	certificate of 	registra- tion 	of which 	he is the lawful 	holder and either 	give his signature 	in English 	or supply 	such other 	or additional 	particulars or furnish 	such means of 	identification as 	the Colonial 	Secretary may either 	generally or in 	particular cases prescribe. 
  Any 	trading licences issued 	under such Ordinance or 	under any 	such bye-law 	or regulation Between 	the tenth day 	of February 1908 and 	the commencement 	of this 	Act to an Asiatic 	who made such application 	as is 	prescribed in sub-section 	(1) (b) of Section 	two of 	this Act 	shall, notwithstanding 	anything in 	Section thirteen 	of Act No. 2 of 1907 contained, 	be deemed to have been lawfully issued.  Section 	thirteen of 	Act No. 2 	of 1907 	shall be 	and is hereby 	repealed. 
 THE  PENALTIES
 Any 	person who—

   Indian 	Opinion, 5-9-1908  (Sgd.) 	J. C. SMUTS 
    APPENDIX IX  P. DUNCAN ON 	COLOUR QUESTION  Mr. 	Patrick Duncan, C.M.G., 	spoke by invitation 	on the 	colour question at 	the annual 	meeting of the 	Rosebank branch of 	the League 	of Women. 	We take 	the following 	important extracts from 	the report of 	the speech 	given in 	The Star dated 	the 5th instant 	[September, 1908]:  It 	was a 	very difficult 	matter in 	a country 	where there was supposed 	to be 	political freedom to 	have the 	largest section of 	the population 	entirely deprived of 	political rights—it was 	practically a 	condition of 	slavery. No 	people had 	ever been 	able to 	 survive for 	long who 	lived on 	an inferior race in 	what was 	practically a 	state  of 	slavery. It 	was bad for the superior 	race just as 	much as 	for the inferior. 	If they 	looked into the cases 	where a small 	superior population lived 	on the 	work of 	the larger 	inferior population, 	giving them no 	political rights, 	that state of things 	did not 	exist for 	long. It was hardly possible 	in the present 	state of society’s civilisation 	for them 	to say 	that, however educated a 	man might 	be, however 	he may 	have advanced 	in civilisation 	in every 	way, he was 	to be excluded 	from political 	rights if 	his skin was 	not of the finest white. 	If they 	tried to make 	colour the test 	for political 	rights, they would find 	the greatest 	difficulty in drawing 	the line. 	They would 	find they were inflicting 	great hardship 	on many 	people, to 	all intents 	and purposes 	as civilised, 	educated, and as 	responsible citizens as 	themselves. It 	was difficult, 	then, to 	maintain the 	colour distinction 	as a 	bar to 	the franchise 	without inflicting 	very serious injustice and 	injury on 	many people.  There 	was also the social side to this question. They ought to give to 	every man, whatever his colour might be, equal justice in the eyes 	of the law. They ought to give him a chance of improving his 	position. They ought not to look down on the ways in which he 	improved himself, however queer or awkward they may be. They could 	not benefit from his labour and refuse to give him every opportunity 	of raising 
 himself in the social scale. There was too much prejudice in this country against people on account of their colour. In applying the principle that the white man must  be the predominant partner in this country, they must also allow the coloured man to live according to his rights, and make the best of what was in him, and not expect him to be a beast of burden and nothing else.
 They must give him every opportunity of living in a cleaner and better way. Many of the so-called Locations found outside the towns in South Africa were a disgrace to civilisation. They could not expect the Native to be a decent citizen if they made him live in such hovels. When they complained that the he was a danger to society, they should remember, if they expected a man to live as a beast, he would be  a beast, and, if they wanted him to be a man, they should treat him in a fitting way. They would not deter the Native from crime merely by savage punishment. Given the incentive to improve himself in social life in his own place, in that place they should respect him as a man. The question was a difficult one. Some people talked of segregation. That was impossible. Both people had to live side by side, and they had the white people in this country who were the trustees for the future of both races, and they had to think how they could live together for the common good of both.

 AFFIDAVITS REGARDING REPEAL OF REGISTRATION ACT
 H. 	S. L. POLAK’S AFFIDAVIT 
 I, HENRY  SALOMON  LEON  POLAK,   of Johannesburg,  do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 I am a British subject, born in England, and domiciled in the Transvaal, of which Colony I am registered Parliamentary Voter. I am an Attorney of the Supreme Court of the Transvaal. I am also Assistant Honorary Secretary of the British Indian Association of the Transvaal. In this latter capacity, I had occasion frequently, during the early part of the voluntary registration of the Asiatic communities that commenced on the 10th February last, immediately, after the compromise had been effected, to discuss the situation with Mr. Chamney, Registrar of Asiatics, who told me, within the Registration Office, that, of course, the Law would be repealed immediately parliament met, if the voluntary registration had been satisfactorily completed. I have a distinct recollection also, although I did not take special note at the time, of hearing Mr. Chamney make similar statements to several persons who were at the Registration Office at different times during this period.

  P. K. NAIDOO’S AFFIDAVIT 
 I, P. K. NAIDOO of Johannesburg, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 On the day that Mr. Gandhi was assaulted in connection with the compromise, and a few hours after, I went over to the Registrar’s Office, in order to protest against Asiatic Law Amendment Act receipt forms being issued in connection with voluntary registration applications, and told him that Indians would not submit to the Act, and that they were undergoing voluntary registration because they were assured that, on their doing so, the Act itself would be repealed. Mr. Nadir Cama was present at the time, and Mr. Chamney emphatically assured us that, voluntary registration being gone through, the Act would certainly be repealed, and that the Asiatic Law Amendment Act forms had been issued only by mistake. In order further to impress us, the Registrar had other typewritten copies made, in which there was no mention of the Asiatic Law Amendment Act.

 I, NADIR CAMA,  of Johannesburg, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 I have read the affidavit of Mr. P. K. NAIDOO, of even date, and confirm the contents thereof. I was largely concerned with persuading the people to accept the compromise, and I had, besides the interview with Mr. Chamney in Mr. Naidoo’s presence, many other interviews with the Registrar of Asiatics, and the latter very often repeated the assurance that the Act would be repealed, in order to strengthen my hands and to pacify the people.

 I, A. M. ANDREWS of Johannesburg, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 On the second or third day of the opening of the Von Brandis Square Office for voluntary registration, I entered the Office to make my application. Mr. Chamney asked me to give my thumb-impression. This I declined to do, claiming exemption on the ground of educational qualifications, and also because I had some misgivings,
 as, the previous day, I had seen receipts for voluntary registration applications issued on forms under the Asiatic Act. Mr. Chamney then pleaded with me, begging me to give the thumb-print in order to enable the Government to have some means of identification. He informed me that the leaders had given their finger impressions, that this was merely an act of grace on the part of the Asiatics and had no connection whatsoever with the Act, that the issuing of the receipts under the Act was merely a clerical error, and that, on the completion of voluntary registration, that Act would be removed from the Statute-book. Mr. Thambi Naidoo was also present at the time.

 THAMBI 	NAIDOO’S AFFIDAVIT 
 I, THAMBI NAIDOO, of Johannesburg, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 I was one of the signatories to the letter addressed to the Colonial Secretary of the Transvaal in connection with the Asiatic Registration Act from the Johannesburg Gaol on the 29th January last.libtech_881_footnoteWhen I sent the letter, I did so fully believing that, by Asiatics undergoing voluntary registration, the Act would be repealed. There was no definite mention made in the letter, in order to make the position of the Government as smooth as possible, but the intention, in stating that the Act be not applied to all those who volun-tarily register and in making the clause applicable to those who might enter at any future time after the expiry of the period of three months fixed for the voluntary registration of those Asiatics who were resident in the Transvaal on the date of the compromise, was that, the Asiatics having honourably fulfilled their obligations, Act 2 of 1907 could be of no use to the Government and would, therefore, be naturally repealed. But the actual promise as to repeal of the Act  was reserved for discussion at the interview between the Colonial Secretary and Mr. Gandhi, the first signatory to the said letter. Two days after the letter was sent to the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Gandhi was summoned to Pretoria. On his return from Pretoria, all the prisoners were dis-charged, and a meeting of British Indians was addressed by him the same day in the afternoon, that is Friday, the 31st January.libtech_882_footnoteAt this meeting, Mr. Gandhi announced that General Smuts had promised to repeal the Act, if the Asiatics fulfilled their part of the compromise, namely, if the Asiatics made application for voluntary registration.
 Subsequently, when the compromise was in working order, and when Mr. Gandhi was assaulted, together with Mr. Essop Mia, I was also assaulted while
 
 
 defending him from further injuries; and, in a bandaged condition, I attended the Registration Office and helped the authorities. The reason of the assault undoubtedly was suspicion, on the part of those who assualted, to the effect that Mr. Gandhi had not acted properly or that the Government would not carry out the promise of repeal, if such promise was given. Another reason for the assault was that the leaders had accepted the principle of registration by ten finger-prints, which, among others, the Pathan section of the community resented most bitterly. The task of prevailing upon  the people to take out voluntary registration, and of assuring the people that the compromise was fair, and that the Act would be repealed, fell upon the shoulders of myself and my co-workers.
 In connection with this, I several times discussed the situation with Mr. Chamney, Registrar of Asiatics, and Mr. Chamney definitely stated to me that, on voluntary registration being undergone by the Asiatics, the Act would be repealed. Mr. Chamney, I am aware, even took to Mr. Gandhi a draft notice that was to be published in the Gazette in connection with the repeal. The assurance given to me was conveyed by me to my countrymen; and I am certain that, but for such an assurance, the community would never have accepted the compromise.

                   DEAR 	FRIEND,    APPENDIX XII  REV. J. J. 	DOKE’S LETTER TO GANDHIJI  11,  SUTHERLAND 	 AVENUE,  JOHANNESBURG,  September 	 30, 1908 
  Your 	beautiful present of the Song 	Celestial. I 	appreciate very much. In every respect it [is] one of the choicest 	treasures which I have—dainty in appearance— fascinating in its 	contents—and of great value and a memento of a friendship which I 	shall always regard with gratitude. Yes, even if the darling wish of 	your heart is fulfilled and I get into prison for it.  By 	the way, 	I hope 	you won’t 	attribute to me any 	selfish motive when 	I confess 	that I am just 	now hammering 	away with all my 	heart at 	Prison reform! Still 	who knows 	what may happen? 	Many thanks 	for this kindness. 	I am 	reading the 	Bhagvad Gita with 	intense interest—although 	I cannot 	say that 	the doctrine: 	“He who 	shall say—Lo! I 	have slain 	a man!’ 	He who 	shall think ‘Lo! 	I am 	slain’—those both 	know naught! ‘Life 	cannot slay. Life is 	not slain!’” 	commands altogether my 	assent. But 	thereby hangs a 	long argument. 	The poetry 	and much of 	the teaching 	is beautiful! 	I went 	down to the 	Office this morning, 	in hope 	of seeing 	Quinn. But failed. 	I am afraid 	the poor 	fellow is in dire 	straits. The stupid 	prosecutions are going  	on as hitherto—one 	more glaring 	than another 	has just for a 	moment caught the 	public eyes—but only 	for a 	moment—[which] will be 	forgotten tomorrow. So 	shall  we 	all be—and at last, even the Asiatic question will be settled.  	Cheer up my friend—  all will 	yet be well.  Try 	and not get confiscated 	and deported 	or any thing 	of that 	kind—if you can 	help it 	just now. I 	have a 	thousand questions to 	ask—on any 	one of which—of course 	the welfare 	of the 	British Empire depends. I 	want to 	kmow why 	the Indians recalled 	you from India by cable.libtech_883_footnoteI want 	to know 	whether the Durban 	people gave the Indian 	Stretcher-bearers a good 	send off when they went to Colenso and Spion Kop,libtech_884_footnoteand did 	 the work done on the 	battle fields make them more friendly to you? I want to know all 	that happened since, and especially I want a good cabinet photograph of yourself—

  question 	put by Dr. Rutherford in the House of Commons yesterday to the 	effect that from a telegram received from the Governor of the 	Transvaal it would appear that Mr. Gandhi had never performed hard 	labour on the public streets.  I 	am desired to inform the Secretary of State that my Committee have 	this morning received a cablegram which states that:  	“Colonel 	Seely is absolutely misinformed as to Gandhi’s treatment. Forwarding 	affidavits.”  I 	am also desired to point out that on October the 17th Reuter’s 	Volksrust Correspondent cabled to the Johannesburg press as follows:  	“The 	Indians who were sentenced yesterday including Mr. Gandhi were today 	working on the Market Square here at road making.”    
 Further, that in a letter addressed by the Rev. J.J. Doke to the Rev. F.B. Meyer on the 21st October, the writer states:
 “Mr. Gandhi was sentenced last Wednesday to two months’ imprisonment with hard labour and may now be seen in prison clothes with a pick-axe road making in Volksrust Market Place in company with the kaffir gang.”
 Colonial Office Record: 291/132
 EXTRACT 	   FROM  ROBERT 	   SUTHERLAND’S	LETTER	TO 	“RAND  DAILY 
 MAIL.”   . 	. . If President Kruger sent Mr. Gandhi and other high-class 	educated British 
  Indians 	in prison 	garb to break 	stones on the 	public roads of 	the late 	Republic for no 	better reason than they 	have been convicted; if 	he treated Indian women 	and children 	with the inhumanity which 	an eye 	witness states he 	saw done at 	one of 	our frontier 	towns, and 	forced Hindus and 	Mussulman political 	prisoners to eat fat or 	starve; if 	he put 	men born and 	bred on 	the plains 	of India 	in ice-cold 	water on a winter’s 	morning  in 	this, to 	them, rigorous climate, 	and made them go for a 	full hour in puris 	naturaubus, it 	would lead to an ultimatum from the British Government, which would 	put a 	stop to 	it in twenty four hours. 	Yet this 	British Colony of 	eighteen months old, 	which has scarcely shed its political swaddling clothes, does it with impunity . . .  . 	Mr. Gandhi’s crime which he is expiating by breaking stones on the 	streets of Volksrust in a dress ornamented with broad arrows is 	practically a protest against these odious laws. There are in India 	gentlemen who rank much higher than the Prime Minister of Nepal; who 	has lately been the honoured guest of England, and there are several 	who take precedence at the Court of St. James, of any in this 	country, yet to the highest the Transvaal laws offer the same 	insult.  Mr. 	Gandhi, the convict of this country’s laws, comes of the same 	class as the Prime Minister of Nepal, and his father when he died 	held the same rank, being Prime Minister of one of the States of 	Western India. Mr. Gandhi himself is a man of high educational 	attainments, a barrister of the Inns of Court and a man of high 	moral character and exemplary life. He was born a Hindoo, but he has 	taken for his guidance what is best in all religions, including 	Christianity, the essence of which he has practised more strictly 	than the majority of nominal Christians.  The 	Magistrate, when passing sentence, we are told, remarked that he was 	sorry to see a man who was an advocate of the Courts of this country 	in such a position, and, had he been in his private house instead of 	on the bench, he might, with equal appositeness, have added that he 	was ashamed of administering a law which compelled a highminded 	patriot to immolate himself in the interest and honour of his 	country and countrymen.  Indian 	Opinion, 7-11-1908  EXTRACT 		  FROM  “NOTES 		ON THE TRANSVAAL  STRUGGLE”   On 	Saturday, spans of 	Indian prisoners from 20 	to 25 strong were sent to 	work on 	the Municipal 	Water Works, cleaning the 	cemetery, and 	tending the 	soldiers’ graves. 	 Mr. Gandhi was included.  It must have been peculiar for him to contemplate 
 his present occupation, after having tended the sick and wounded during the Boer War and led the Stretcher-Bearer Corps during the recent Natal Rebellion,—tempora mutantur.

 R. 	M. SODHA’S AFFIDAVITlibtech_886_footnote 
 I, Ratanshi Mulji Sodha, of Natal, presently of Johannesburg, do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 On the 14th day of October, Mr. Gandhi, a number of other Indians, and myself were sentenced to periods of imprisonment with hard labour at Volksrust. On the morning of the 15th Mr. Gandhi, I and 13 others, together with  about  15  Natives,were taken out to work on the side of agricultural show ground close to the fence which divides the ground from the public road. Our work there was to dig and remove stones. We were quite close to the road, and anybody who passed could easily see us and here distinctly what was going on. A number of Europeans and Natives did pass by.  The ground is within the Municipality of Volksrust, and the road is used by a number of people. The European warder who was in charge of the Indian prisoners kept on urging Mr. Gandhi to work harder and harder, though Mr. Gandhi was doing his best. All this might have been clearly heard by passers-by. The exact words used were “Come on, Gandhi; come on, Gandhi”. Mr. Gandhi replied that he was doing his utmost, and was even trying to do more. The Warder kept urging Mr. Gandhi when he saw Mr. Gandhi stoop to pick up earth to rub on the palms of his hands, which were getting raw through blistering. When after nine hours’ almost continuous work, with  a delay of one hour between 12 and 1, Mr. Gandhi returned to the gaol, he was so stiff with pain and fatigue that he could scarcely move. At 12 o’clock on this day, one of the Indian prisoners who had fainted through over-strain, heat and lack of water, which the Warder did not allow him to get, was taken in a sanitary cart to the gaol. Mr. Gandhi accompanied him in this cart. On the afternoon of that day, we were under the charge of a Native Warder, who also kept urging Mr. Gandhi to go on working, although he was doing his best. The words used were “Come on, Gandhi; come on, Gandhi”.  Passers-by could easily hear and see this.   On the   next day we were taken to  a piece of ground near the road-side, almost opposite Mr. Suliman Ahmed Cajee’s store. Mr. Cajee who was standing in front of the store, could easily see and hear whatever was going on. This, of course, would be from the opposite side of the road, but passers-by could come quite close to us. We were digging holes for trees. and worked on this day as on the previous day, for nine hours.

With 		regard to 		the first point, 		Ministers have the 		honour to 		confirm the 		telegram sent on 		the 3rd November last to 		the Right Honourable the 		Secretary of 		State for 		the Colonies in 		which it 		was stated 		that Mr. Gandhi, 		who always 		worked in the 		Indian gang of 		prisoners, was 		employed for 		two and half days in 		the Agricultural 		Show Ground at 		Volksrust digging holes 		for trees, 		and thereafter 		in the 		Municipal Plantation 		and Gaol 		Gardens. He 		never performed 		hard labour in 		public streets. 		Further enquiry also 		shows that Indian prisoners were treated with every consideration 		consistent with the 		Gaol Regulations. The 		work performed was 		of a very light nature 		and water was at no time 		refused when required. One of the prisoners fainted owing to the 		extreme heat 		and was conveyed 		back to 		the gaol 		in a 		“scotch”, or 		ordinary transport cart, and not in a, sanitary cart as is alleged.  As 		regards the 		second point, Ministers 		have the honour 		to state 		that Mr. 		Gandhi was 		returned from 		Volksrust to 		Johannesburg Prison in 		his Prison 		clothes as prescribed 		by the 		Regulations. During 		the journey 		from Volksrust, 		the Warder 		in charge 		offered Mr. Gandhi 		to procure 		a cab 		for him at Johannesburg 		station and 		repeated his 		offer on 		arrival at 		the station. 		Mr. Gandhi, 		however, elected to walk 		to the 		Prison and 		carried his 		kit in accordance 		with the Regulations. 		On arrival 		at the 		Prison, Mr. Gandhi was 		received by the Chief Warder and informed him that he had no 		complaint to 		make. He 		was seen the following 		day by 		the Governor 		of the 		Prison to 		whom he made the same statement.   Colonial 	Office Records:291/136      APPENDIX XIV    TREATMENT IN 	PRISON: (a) MARCHED IN CONVICT’S GARB   EXTRACT FROM H. S. L. POLAK’S LETTER TO THE PRESS ,OCTOBR 26, 1908   Mr. 	Gandhi has been sentenced to two months’ hard labour for the 	offence of failing to give totally unnecessary finger-prints for 	identification purposes. He has been set to work upon the public 	streets at Volksrust. Nobody complains about that. 
 It is part of the punishment to be borne by people whom General Smuts calls conscientious objectors. But is there any excuse for bringing Mr. Gandhi from Volksrust to Johannesburg in convict garb, as happened yesterday, and marching him from Park Station to the Fort publicly? Doubtless it was all part of the regulations. I believe that, when the Spanish Inquisition desired to degrade its victims, among whom were probably ancestors of mine, it clothed them in bag shaped yellow garb and marched them in this fashion through the streets prior to despatching them at the customary auto-da fe. We, Transvaal Britishers, do not seem to have gone far beyond those mediaeval torturers in our desire to bring our victims to what, in our opinion, is a fitter frame of mind. Can you wonder that the Indian Community is getting more and more embittered and exasperated; and do you not marvel how, in spite of all these injuries and insults, they remain content to be passive resisters, suffering themselves rather than imposing suffering upon their European fellow- colonists? Contrast the Christian example shown by these non-Christian people with the Pagan cruelty of their Christian rulers. It makes one flush with shame to think of it all.

 “A 	SHOCKING SIGHT”libtech_887_footnote 
 On Sunday last, Mr. Gandhi was removed from Volksrust Gaol to the Fort, Johannesburg, he having been subpoenaed as a witness for the Crown in the case of Daya Lalla, who was charged with using a forged registration certificate, the case being now sent to the Criminal Sessions for trial. Mr. Gandhi was removed in convict dress, in charge of a warder, in whose company he travelled to Johannesburg. A few members of the Committee of the Association had got wind of the removal, and met the train upon its arrival at Park Station at six o’clock in the evening. Mr. Gandhi, carrying his bundle of clothes in a large bag marked with the broad arrow, a basket of books, and, of course, wearing the convict suit, was then marched in custody from Park Station to the Fort. It was then broad daylight, and the streets were filled with onlookers, some of whom recognized Mr. Gandhi, even in the hideous disguise that he wore. Mr. Gandhi, of course, wore the convict garb of coloured prisoners, a particularly conspicuous one. Doubtless all this happened in terms of the regulations, but it is typical of the anti-Asiatic policy of the Government that no instructions were issued that Mr. Gandhi should be transferred in civil dress, and taken   to the Fort in a cab. So long as cultured Indian passive resisters and conscientious objectors are treated as though they were aboriginal native felons of the worst type, so long must this fight continue.

  H. S. L. POLAK’S AFFIDAVIT 
 I, Henry Salomon Leon Polak of Johannesburg do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
 I am a British subject, born in England.  I am an Attorney of the Supreme Court  of the Transvaal. I am Assisstant Honorary Secretary of the British  Indian Association. I was present on the afternoon of Sunday the 25th October last, when Mr. Gandhi arrived by the Natal train from Volksrust. He was in custody and dressed in Convict suit. He carried a large bundle and a basket of books. The train arrived at the scheduled time 6.0 p.m. It was then broad daylight. The sun did not set until a considerable time afterwards. Mr. Gandhi was marched through the public streets from the Station to the Johannes- burg Gaol.  This would take about twelve minutes.  It would have been broad daylight all the time. I walked part of the way to the gaol at  Mr. Gandhi’s side. I left Mr. Gandhi half way to the Gaol. I then walked back for about ten minutes to catch my tram, and thereafter went home. When I arrived home it was still daylight approaching dusk. As Mr. Gandhi walked through the streets he was in full view of every passer-by who could distinguish him clearly and many people recognised him. The official sunset time on that afternoon was 6.17 p.m. I make this statement as it has been suggested that Mr. Gandhi was taken through the streets at dusk. This is not true. During the whole time that I was with Mr. Gandhi, it was broad daylight.libtech_888_footnote

 months’ imprisonment with hard labour for failing to produce  means  of identification.
 He has now been removed from Volksrust, and is now closely confined in the Central Prison, Pretoria.
 Yesterday it was necessary that he should appear in some case in the Magistrate’s Court. I understand he was brought there from the cells, dressed in civilian clothes, but handcuffed !
 Of course, there may be amongst us those who will be glad to hear that indignities are being heaped on this great Indian leader; but I venture to hope that the great majority of our colonies will feel ashamed and angry that a man of the character and position of Mr. Gandhi should be needlessly insulted in this way.
 He came voluntarily from Natal to be imprisoned. He has always shown the utmost chivalry in his dealings with the authorities. Why then should shameful indignity be put upon him?
 Some will no doubt reply, “It is simply a prison regulation.” Allow me to point out that there are no regulations scheduled for the class of prisoners repre- sented by Mr. Gandhi; a class, not of criminals, but, as General Smuts termed them,  of “conscientious objectors”. Form Volksrust Gaol to Pretoria, it was not considered necessary to use handcuffs, neither were they employed in Johannesburg, surely in Pretoria this needless insult should have been avoided.
 His Excellency the High Commissioner, speaking in Cape Town last week, in the course of a very fine address on the Native question, is reported to have reflected strongly on “the policy of pin-pricks” and its “cumulative effect”.
 It is that, “policy of pin-pricks” applied to the Asiatics here, not by irresponsible persons, but by officials of the Government, which increases the irrita- tion in India and renders a settlement of this difficult business well nigh impossible.

         SIR,   EMILE 			NATHAN’S 			LETTER TO “THE 			TRANSVAAL LEADER”    [JOHANNESBURG,  March 	12, 1909 ]    A few days ago rumour had it that Mr.  Gandhi, now suffering three months’ 
  imprisonment 	for a 	cause which he 	rightly or 	wrongly espouses, when 	testifying as a witness 	in the Court 	at Pretoria 	was handcuffed. 	One could 	hardly believe the rumour 	to be correct, 	but in 	your issue this morning 	the Rev. 	J. J. Doke 	draws further attention 	to the rumour.  I 	am not aware that the prison regulations demand that a prisoner when 	giving 
 evidence in Court should in all circumstances be handcuffed. If it is a fact that a man like Mr. Gandhi—one of the quietest and most unassuming men going, highly educated, and a gentlemen to the tips of his fingers—was handcuffed and submitted to that unnecessary indignity, it seems to me monstrous, and nothing short of a shame and a disgrace.
 I trust an enquiry will be held, and, if the rumour be true and the action unwarranted, that the wrong and insult administered will be redressed and  the wrongdoer adequately punished.

  “AN 		EXPRESSION OF REGRET”libtech_890_footnote  
 While on the topic, we may express what we believe to be the general regret of the Natal public that certain Transvaal officials should have thought it necessary the other day to subject Mr. Gandhi to the indignity of handcuffing while being     is  the walked through the streets to give evidence in the Police Courts. This, we believe, is the prescribed procedure under the regulations, but Mr. Gandhi is at least a political prisoner, and as such deserves better treatment than that measured out to debased criminals. A regulation that subjects any man, no matter what the charge against him, to such treatment is monstrous, and in this particular instance should have been avoided, as it will only provide a weapon against the Transvaal regarding its attitude towards Asiatics.

  QUESTION 		IN HOUSE OF COMMONS  
 Mr. O’Grady asked the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies whether he was aware that Mr. Gandhi, the Transvaal Indian leader, who was undergoing three months’ hard labour under the Registration Laws, was, on March 10, marched from the Pretoria Gaol to the magistrate’s court, where his attendance was required as a witness, handcuffed; whether he would enquire if this indignity upon Mr. Gandhi was intentionally imposed by the authorities, or occurred by mistake; and whether representations would be made to the Transvaal Government to treat British Indians, who were going to goal for what they consider to be conscience sake, less severely than convicted criminals?
 Colonel Seely: There has been no suggestion that Mr. Gandhi has been subjected to any special disability. Mr Gandhi has been treated in every respect as any other prisoner would have been treated, and on a previous occasion he himself said he did not wish to be treated in any other way	I am quite certain that I  am
correct in saying that Mr. Gandhi has not been subjected to any special indignity.  .  .
 
 . I am satisfied on the evidence laid before me that Mr. Gandhi has been subjected to  no indignity beyond that suffered by any person of any colour in similar case.

  Ministers 	have the honour 	to acknowledge 	the receipt 	of His 	Excellency the 	Deputy-Governor’s 	Minute No. 	15/1/09(2) of 	the 13th instant, 	covering copy of 	despatch No. 	146 dated 24th April, 	from the Right 	Honourable the Secretary 	of State 	for the Colonies 	on the subject 	of the treatment 	of Mr. M.

It is the universal 	rule  to  handcuff 	prisoners when 	so marchad 	and they 	are so 	marched when 	the prison 	van is 	not available, 	as happened 	in the 	case in 	point. The 	rule applies equally to 	European convicted 	prisoners and there 	was no 	reason therefore for 	exempting an 	Indian from 	its operation.

    APPENDIX XV  COMMENTS BY 	“RAND DAILY MAIL”  On 	the 21st instant, the Rand 	Daily Mail made the 	following editorial comments:  Though 	the scheme of the Asiatics in the Transvaal for closing their stores 	is undoubtedly a clever one, it will hardly popularise their cause 	in this country. It simply means that the so-called passive 	resistance has degenerated into coercion. There is no doubt that 	numbers of the Indians have been intimidated by their fellows, and 	are afraid to register or to take out trading licences; and now the 	scheme is to intimidate the European merchants and the Transvaal 	Government. We hope these methods commend themselves to Mr. Hosken 	and The Transvaal 	Leader and the other 	advocates of deliberate law-breaking in this Colony. But in the case 	of the majority of the people we feel sure that these tactics will 	destroy the last shred of sympathy with the Asiatic cause. Anyway we 	are convinced the Transvaal 
 Government will not be bullied into making concessions by such methods, and we hope that the wholesale traders affected will not allow themselves to be made the tools of law-breaking Indians. We do not think that many of the Asiatics will fall in with Mr. Gandhi’s little plan, and ruin themselves completely to further the cause of passive resistance when it assumes such a new and startling form. We believe that a firm attitude will quickly make the plot a failure. And in the  meantime  the Government should pay a little more attention to the picketing system which is intimidating so many of the law-abiding Indians and preventing them fulfilling the letter of the law.

 THE KAFFIR INCIDENT
    EXTRACT 			FROM 			REVIEW OF 			“A 			 TRAGEDY  OF 			 EMPIRE” 			 BY  H.  S.  L. 			POLAK, 			IN “RAND 			DAILY MAIL”, 5-11-1909:   
 “. . . it is alleged that whilst in prison, Mr. Gandhi was “seized by a Kaffir, lifted high in the air and dashed violently to the ground. Had he not seized hold of a door-post as he fell, he would have undoubtedly had his skull split open!’ ”
    EXTRACT 			FROM REW. 			J. J. DOKE’S 			LETTER DATED 			OCTOBER 7 			TO “RAND 			DAILY MAIL”:   
 “In a sub-leader on the above subject published in your issue of Tuesday, I notice that you hesitate to accept Mr. Polak’s statement that a brutal assault had been made by a Kaffir on Mr. Gandhi, while the latter gentleman was imprisoned in Johannesburg Gaol. You say: ‘It is not stated whether Mr. Gandhi complained to the prison authorities and had the Kaffir punished’ . . . and you add, ‘in any case the attack does not seem to us to be one for which the Transvaal Government can be held responsible.’
 It happens that I am able to supply part of the missing information. When I knew of the shameful assault, the details of which you naturally do not publish, I spoke of it personally to Mr. Roos, who expressed regret, and said that Mr. Gandhi had already told him of it. The Kaffir, I imagine, was not punished, as Mr. Gandhi would make it a point of conscience not to identify the man who had injured him. In similar circumstances, he refused to prosecute the Pathan by whom he had been assaulted.
 Regarding the responsibility of the Government, I fail to agree with you. It is perfectly true that the Government had nothing immediately to do with the assault, and that great regret was privately expressed, and I have no doubt was felt, that this had happened, but the Government is nevertheless responsible for the system under which it was possible. The fact is that passive resistance Indians have been classed  as ‘Natives’ and as criminals, and all attempts to get this altered, so far as I am aware, have failed. As a ‘Native’, Mr. Gandhi was locked up on one occasion in a cell with
 Natives, and suffered a night of torture such as Mr. Polak describes. As a Native he was obliged to consort with Natives, and in that enforced contact the assault was committed. Efforts are made now and I believe successfully, to keep the Indians as much as possible to themselves. But so long as they are classed with Natives as criminals, and watched by Native warders, what happened to Mr. Gandhi in the Fort, to Nagappen at Yokeskei River Camp, and the others in different gaols may happen at any moment.”

       TO  THE 	EDITOR THE 	TIMES LONDON SIR,  APPENDIX XVII  EUROPEANS’ 	LETTER TO “THE TIMES”libtech_891_footnote 
  The 	signatories of this letter are, most of them, South African 	Colonists of many years’ standing. One is a member of the 	Transvaal Legislative Assembly, others are clergymen of various 	Christian denominations, whilst others belong to one or other of the 	professions or are engaged in commercial pursuits. In addressing 	this letter to you, we are moved by feeling of concern regarding the 	present phases of what is known as the Transvaal Asiatic question. 	We frankly accept the position that the further immigration of 	Asiatics into this Colony shall be most stringently restricted. And 	the Asiatics themselves have publicly accepted that position.  But 	recent events have shown us that the welfare of the Empire, which we 	have   at heart, may 	be endangered unless a 	speedy termination of 	the present state of 	affairs can 	be effected. 	The Transvaal-domiciled 	Indians to-day in India 	are likely to 	be a grave 	source of danger 	to the 	Empire, since 	they will have left this Colony with a 	feeling of 	bitterness in 	their hearts at 	the remembrance 	of their 	harsh treatment by 	their European 	fellow-subjects of the 	Crown, a 	feeling which they will 	not be slow 	to ventilate amidst the 	sympathetic surroundings 	of their 	native land.  It 	has been, perhaps 	too easily, 	assumed that the public 	opinion of the 	white population 	of the 	Transvaal is 	unitedly opposed to 	the Asiatic 	claims. We believe, 	however, that, whilst the 	number of 	European sympathisers 	with the 	Asiatics who 	will openly 	express their views 	is not great, 	there is an important 	body of sympathisers 	in the 	European section of 	the community 	who are grieved 	and hurt at 	the treatment 	being meted out 	to the 	Asiatics for 	no apparent 	useful purpose. 	We have carefully examined the claims put forth by them, and we have had opportunities    
 of satisfying ourselves that they  are legitimate and of such a degree of moderation as to be capable of being granted, without danger to the Colony. They are, in effect, two only. The first is that, at the next session of Parliament, the Government will introduce as a Government measure legislation repealing the obnoxious Asiatic Law Amendment Act, which the Colonial Secretary has declared to be unworkable. This law, which was passed unanimously by Parliament without consultation with the Asiatic leaders, and on the assumption that there was a considerable illicit influx of Asiatics into the Transvaal, has now been, for all practical purposes, replaced by the new Validation Act, which is generally acceptable to the Asiatics, and which removed the stigma under which they feel they labour so long as the old Act remains on the Statute-book. In a speech delivered at Richmond, Johannesburg, on February 5 last, General Smuts is reported to have said:
 “The character of that law was that it should come into force once, and should have its effect once, and once for all. It was a very risky law, because, if the Asiatics did not come forward during that period, registration became impossible, and the law became a dead-letter. What happened? They were at a complete deadlock. That was the position into which they had drifted now. It was not by the fault of the Government, not by the fault of a party, because a law had been passed that required the co-operation of the Indian population. They did not give the co-operation; but they simply stood aside.”
 Thus, besides being declared by the Colonial Secretary to be unworkable, the old Asiatic Act has also been superseded by more recent and generally unobjec- tionable legislation, and is, consequently, no longer of any real value to anyone. The Asiatics have all along resented the imputations upon which the policy laid down in the old Act was based, and realise that so long as it remains their position is peri- lous. Undoubtedly, in our opinion, they undertook voluntary registration in the belief that the Act would be repealed, and they feel that their straightforward action in carrying out their voluntary obligations has not been reciprocated.
 The second point is that the Asiatics request the recognition of the right of educated Indians to enter the Colony under the restrictions of the general Immigration Law of the Colony. It is admitted that the Immigration Act alone does not exclude educated Asiatics from entry into the Transvaal. On their side, the Asiatics are willing to allow the Government, by administrative methods, to restrict such immigration by raising the education test for Asiatic immigrants so as to make it impossible for others than professional men and university graduates to enter the Colony, and they have further publicly consented that the Government may administratively limit the number of these to six per annum. They urge, and we are at one with them in this, that the provision of temporary permits, renewable from time to time, is un-British and unsuited to their needs, for those to whom these permits would be granted would be allowed to enter the Colony as an act of grace and not as a matter of right, that they would be prohibited immigrants with the penalties suspended, and they would, consequently, be unable efficiently to practise their professions. We feel that the unhampered admission of this small number of cultured
 Asiatics is a necessity to the welfare of the Asiatics themselves, and even more important to the European population. Without  the  means  of  communal development, the Asiatics must, in course of time, become a source of danger to the white Colonists, for, in the absence of their natural leaders, they would sink to a depth of degradation which we cannot contemplate with equanimity.
 It is to secure these two points—all else being a matter of detail only—and easily capable of adjustment—that the Asiatics are prosecuting a resolute policy of passive resistance. They are the greatest sufferers by their acts, and, as they are an unrepresented and otherwise voiceless minority, whose views have been on almost every occasion ignored by the Legislature, it is difficult to discover any other course open to them, to secure redress of their grievances than that which they have adopted.
 It has been suggested that the hardships of the present struggle, that the Asiatics have so vehemently protested against, are largely fictitious.  We are unable  to subscribe to that opinion. We consider that the Asiatics’ complaints are, on the whole, justified. There has been an enormous amount of hardship and suffering inflicted as the result of this unfortunate misunderstanding. Since the new phase of the struggle commenced, some four months ago, nearly 900 sentences of imprison- ment with hard labour have been imposed upon men whom General Smuts himself has called “conscientious objectors”. They have been treated in gaol no better than aboriginal native felons, and the prison diet has been entirely unsuited to their national habits. Indeed, in some gaols, the food has been religiously “unclean”, and, as a result, many of the Asiatic prisoners have been half-starved. There can be no doubt, too, of the immense financial loss that has befallen the Asiatic communities since the struggle first commenced, over two years ago, both by way of actual expenditure, and business loss due to restriction of trade. The mental anxiety of the Asiatic population, too, induced by the present unsettlement, has been intense, and this has reacted upon all sections of the population.
 For ourselves, we are satisfied, from personal observation, of the earnestness and determination of the Asiatics in the prosecution of their struggle for what they believe is justly due to them. They have shown a degree of courage and self-sacrifice, and an honourable intention to abide by their obligations, that have evoked admiration. Many of their leaders, who are to-day in gaol for the sake of their compatriots, are cultured men who would be an honour to any community. They include professional men, wealthy merchants, priests and well-known traders. Those who are to-day in gaol include representatives of all sections of the Asiatic commu- nities, from the hawker to the wholesale merchant, from the clerk to the professional man. All faiths and castes are represented, and the Asiatics have shown a unanimity that is as praiseworthy as it was unexpected. We feel that the prolongation of this struggle must have a most unfavourable effect upon the trade and commerce of this country, adding unnecessarily to the many difficulties with which it is faced in its efforts to achieve nationhood.
 In these circumstances, we trust that a settlement on the lines above indicated will be sought by the Transvaal Government. In our opinion, there is nothing in the
 Asiatic demands that cannot safely be conceded. These is a grave danger lest the British public be misled as to the real nature of the struggle now proceeding. It appears to us that it would be wise and prudent if, in future, legislation concerning the unrepresented sections of the people were not passed without previous consultation with their leaders. We wish it distinctly to be understood that we are in the fullest sympathy with all efforts of the Government to equalise conditions of European and Asiatic competition. To this end, it may be wise not only to apply existing municipal, sanitary, and other standards strictly, but even to raise such standards. But we respectfully submit that nothing could react more injuriously upon the European race than to deprive the Asiatics of all opportunity for development, and thus to diminish their wants instead of increasing them.

               DEAR 	SIR,  APPENDIX XVIII  LORD CURZON’S 	LETTER TO GANDHIJI       GROOTE 	 SCHUUR,  RONDEBOSCH,  February 	 2, 1909 
  I 	am extremely sorry that 	owing to an alteration 	in my plans 	caused by illness, 	  I was 	in Johannesburg 	for so 	short a 	time as 	to be unable to 	meet your Committee 	in person and discuss with them the circumstances of the case.  As 	it was, I endeavoured to make myself acquainted with both sides of 	it by personal enquiries and by a study of the papers with which I 	was provided by the courtesy of yourself and of others.  Upon 	my arrival here, H. E. Lord Selborne had arranged to meet me with 	General Botha and Mr. Smuts; and we had a prolonged and friendly 	conversation about the matter, in which every aspect of it was 	passed under review.  I 	had of course no authority to act upon your behalf. But my 	connection with India and the earlier history of the case, perhaps, 	gave me some title to express an opinion.  My 	own impression, in entering upon the discussion, was that it should 	not be impossible to find some solution of the present difficulty 	which should be equally honourable to all parties; and I received 	repeated assurances from General Botha and Mr. Smuts of their 	anxiety ot treat the British Indians in the Transvaal in a spirit of 
 liberality as well as justice.
 How far it would have been possible, had I remained longer in the country, and been able to communicate personally with the principal parties concerned—to effect any settlement, it would be useless now to conjecture.
 The main obstacle to such an arrangement at the moment appeared to be that,  if the anticipations as to the formation of a single Government for South Africa are realised—as everyone hopes will be the case—the question will shortly be taken up again by a more powerful authority than the Government of any one State, and settled on wider grounds than those which affect the position of the Indians in the Transvaal alone.
 As soon as unification is carried [out] in this country, there must be communications between the joint Government of South Africa and the Home Govt. on this as on other matters; and I should hope personally that these communi- cations—which ought not now to be long delayed—may be made the occasion for a final and satisfactory settlement of this vexed problem.
 If either then or at any other time, I can be of service to the Indian community in S. Africa, I shall be very happy.

    APPENDIX XIX  MINUTES OF 	MEETING HELD ON JUNE 13, 1909  A 	Special Committee of British Indians has been appointed to decide 	the personnel of the delegation to England.  The 	members thereof are:  1. 	H. O. Ally, 2. M. K. Gandhi, 3. Hajee Habib, 4. A. M. Cachalia, 5. 	T. Naidoo 6. N. A. Cama, 7. Shaboodeen, 8. Omerjee Sale, 9. Kamissa, 	10. Dadabhai, and 11. G. V. Godfrey.  Mr. 	Gandhi proposes that Messrs Cachalia, himself, with V. A. Chetty and 	Mr. H. Habib should go to England as the latter now declares himself 	as a passive resister.  Mr. 	Ally objects to this on the grounds: (1) that it is not sincere, (2) 	because the mandate is not on Unification, and (3) because V. A. 	Chetty is not competent. 
 the mandate is not on Unification, and (3) because V. A. Chetty is not competent. Mr. Kamissa agrees with Mr. Ally. Mr. Cama might be preferred if elected.
 Mr. G. V. godfrey objects to the proposition on the grounds, that: (1) some of the personnel will not be of any use in England on account of incompetency and, (2) the majority of Indians in the Transvaal will not agree to this one-sided proposition.
 Mr. Dadabhai counter proposes that Mr. Cama, Mr. Gandhi and Habib should
 
 go.   Mr. 	Cama supports Mr. Gandhi’s original proposition. Mr. 	Naidoo explains that the meeting is mistaken about the abilities of 	Mr. 
  Chetty 	and that 	he is quite 	able to address 	an English 	audience. Mr. Naidoo 	corrects this 	and says, 	that Mr. Chetty 	can explain 	himself as well 	as Mr. 	Habib or 	Mr. Cachalia. 	Mr. Shaboodeen 	proposes at this 	stage “that non-passive 	resisters should go 	and not passive resisters.”  This 	proposition is 	put to 	the meeting 	and the following 	gentlemen vote for. 	viz: 	Mr. Ally, 	Godfrey, Shaboodeen, 	Kamissa and Hajee Habib, 	against  Cama, 	 Gandhi, Naidoo, Dadabhai, Cachalia and Omerjee Sale.  Mr. 	Gandhi moves 	his original proposition. 	It is put 	to the 	vote and carried by 	6 against 	3. The 	six voting for 	it are 	Mr. Gandhi, (mover) Mr. 	Omerjee Sale, 	(Seconder) Naidoo, Cama, 	Dadabhai, and 	Cachalia, against Mr. 	Ally, Godfrey, and 	Shaboodeen. Mr. 	Kamissa declines to vote.  Mr. 	Godfrey restores his objections to Mr. Gandhi’s proposition. Mr. 	Ally does likewise.  Mr. 	Hajee Habib hereby 	declares himself 	a passive 	resister and 	on this condition 	he is to go in the delegation.  About 	300 Indians present at the meeting.

GANDHI,  I 	take the opportunity 	afforded by an interval 	in the 	House of Lords 	to write 	you a few lines. In the 	first place, let me thank you for your letter of the 29th July and 	 for the copy of 	your “Concise 	Statement”, which you 	sent to me so promptly. 	I am also 	much obliged to 	you for the several 	telegrams in which 	you intimated that 	you would 	be guided 	by me for the present. 	I am afraid 	that it must 	seem to you that 	I am 	losing time 	but this is 	really not 	the case. 	The authorities 	 are,  of  course, 	tremendously busy over the South Africa Bill and Imperial Defence, not to mention   498	THE 	COLLECTED WORKS 	OF MAHATMA GANDHI 
 convenience. Meanwhile, I am putting in a touch here and there by letter or by word  of mouth wherever I see an opportunity.  Now as regards your letter of the 29th:  There  is only one point on which I should be glad of a little further explanation, for the rest was quite clear and explicit. You tell me unequivocally that you receive no financial support from sedition-mongers in India but you do not answer my question (I think I put it) whether they are co-operating with you or advising you in any other way. I should like to be able to give a positive denial to that charge, which I do not myself believe, and to say that the continuance of your “Passive Resistance” is absolutely independent of anything that is being said or done in India. The contrary is alleged against you and I am naturally anxious to be able to repudiate the charge with proofs more effective than my own personal belief.
 You marked the “Statment” as an “unrevised proof” and so I am encouraged to make a few suggestions.
 PARA 15: With reference to the first two sentences, I suggest that you should add as an appendix Mr. Ritch’s comparative statement of the position now and before the War. There ought to be some brief explanation of the effect of Law 3 of 1885.
 PARA 17: Before the last sentence but one I would suggest a little amplification. It would be appropriate to explain that the five-finger method of identification, which in India is confined to criminals, was deliberately adopted although Sir E. Henry’s report stated that thumb-impressions only were sufficient.
 PARA 20: It seems to me advisable to explain exactly  how  the  total prohibition was brought about by reading the Asiatic Law and Immigration Law together.
 PARA 21: Surely “Act 2 of 1907” should be substituted for “Act 1908”. PARA 22: The terms of the compromise should be set forth.
 After this paragraph a little connecting narrative seems to be wanting. You want to tell how the Indians found that the compromise was not what they honestly believed it would be.
 PARA 25: This might be re-drafted so as to show that it was not the fault of the Indians that “repeal fell through”. It would also be desirable to explain in what respect General Smuts “went back even upon the written and manifest terms of the compromise”.
 PARA 26: does not explain sufficiently clearly why the Indians burned their certificates. It should be remembered that this Statement, if it is used at all, will be for the instruction of persons who know nothing at all about this question.
 PARA 29: I suggest that the petition referred to should be printed as an
appendix.
 PARA 30: (1) Is not “1908” again a misprint for “1907”? For the rest I think  that you have wonderfully compressed the long story and brought out all the essential points. I hope that you will not mind my offering these few suggestions, for it seems to me that I am necessarily in a better position to appreciate what information is required by people in this country than you to whom the whole circumstances are so familiar.
 Yours very faithfully,
 AMPTHILL

 TRANSVAAL  INDIANS’	PETITIONS
  PETITION 	TO THE QUEENlibtech_892_footnote THE 	QUEEN’S 	MOST 	EXCELLENT MAJESTY 
LONDON
 THE PETITION OF THE WIVES, THE MOTHERS, OR THE DAUGHTERS OF BRITISH  INDIANS IN THE TRANSVAAL WHO HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE TRANSVAAL
 GAOLS DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS FOR CONSCIENCE’S SAKE
HUMBLY SHEWETH THAT:
 Your Petitioners are the wives, mothers or daughters of British Indians who have suffered or still are suffering imprisonment in the Transvaal in connection with the Asiatic struggle that has been unfortunately going on in the Transvaal.
 Your Petitioners believe the struggle on the part of the British Indians to be righteous and for the honour of their race.
 Your Petitioners are further aware that those Indians who have  been continually courting imprisonment are bound by a solemn oath not to submit to the Asiatic Act of the Transvaal Parliament until the grievances which have dictated the oath are redressed.
 Your Petitioners have felt bound to encourge their sons, husbands or fathers, as the case may be, in observing their obligation.
 Owing to the above, Your Petitioners have in many cases been obliged to suffer not only the pangs of separation but [also] privation. Many Indian families have been reduced to poverty during the struggle.
 Your Petitioners are aware that, under the British Constitution, Your Majesty cannot directly intervene on behalf of the sufferers. But Your Petitioners respectfully lay their case before Your Gracious Majesty in the hope that it may be possible for Your Majesty to use your influence unofficially, as mother or wife feeling for mothers or wives, and help to end a situation that has become most acute.
 The points required by the sufferers are the repeal of a law which is no longer required by the Government and the removal of a racial bar in the immigration law of the Colony, so that it may be possible for the most highly educated Indians to enter the Colony on the same terms as any other immigrants.
 Your Petitioners respectfully hope that their humble prayer will be taken into
 
 consideration by Your Gracious Majesty.
 And for this act of justice and mercy, Your Petitioners shall for ever pray, etc.
 Indian Opinion, 3-7-1909
 PETITION 	TO DADABHAI NAOROJI 
TO
THE HON’BLE DADABHAI NAOROJI
SIR,
 We, the undersigned, British Indians residing in the  Transvaal  hereby approach you as the father of the Indian nation that is to be, with reference to the gigantic struggle in which we are engaged in this Colony. Through you we appeal to the whole of India.
 We will not go into the history of the struggle, but will state the question as it stand today.
 The Indian inhabitants of the Transvaal have asked for repeal of the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907, so that Indians possessing educational attainments, be they ever so few, even six per year, may enter the Transvaal on the same terms as the other immigrants. To-day, by reason of the Registration Act read together with the Immigration Act of the Colony, no British Indian can immigrate into the Colony unless he has been previously domiciled. The laws of  the  Colony,  therefore  constitute a colour bar. No other British Colony possesses such legislation. Indians have, therefore, publicly entered into a solemn covenant not to submit to the Registration Acts of the Colony but to suffer imprisonment and other hardships until the national insult is removed.
 Under the covenant, during the past two years and six months, over 2,500 Indians have suffered imprisonment mostly with hard labour. Many homes have been broken up, many families have been ruined, in the struggle. Fathers and sons have gone to goal at the same time, leaving behind them weeping wives and mothers. Many families are being supported from charitable funds raised by us. At the present moment, nearly two hundred Indians are suffering imprisonment for conscience’ sake.
 The hardship felt has been so great that many have succumbed owing to sheer exhaustion. Others have left the Colony and are probably today starving. A resolute band of over 300 continues an active struggle. Some have passed through the Transvaal goals five times.
 The covenanters are derived from all classes and strata of Indian society. Hindus, Mahomedans, Parsees, Sikhs and Christians are all fighting India’s battle. Merchants who have never undergone physical exertion and have been brought up in the lap of luxury are breaking stones, or doing scavenger’s work, or wheeling barrows of earth and living on coarse mealie meal and boiled potatoes or rice and ghee.
 We ask India to come to the rescue and demand from the Indian Government a removal of the bar sinister. Until the racial taint from the Transvaal legislation is
 removed, the little band of Indians referred to above will suffer unto death. We pray for relief.
 Indian Opinion, 3-7-1909
 PETITION 	TO BENGAL CHAMBER 	OF COMMERCE 
TO
THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 BENGAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CALCUTTA
SIR,
 We, the undersigned, British Indians residing in the  Transvaal,  beg  to approach you as the leader of Anglo-India. We approach you regarding the Asiatic struggle that has now been going on in this Colony for the past two years and a half.
 We do not desire to trouble you with the history of the question. The point of dispute between the local Government and the British Indians is whether, as regard immigration, the laws of the Colony are to contain a racial disqualification. The local Parliament has passed two laws— one called the Asiatic Registration Act of 1907, and the other the Immigration Act of the same year—whereby a British Indian, no matter what his educational attainments may be, becomes upon entering the Colony, unless previously domiciled, a prohibited immigrant by reason of his Indian birth or extraction. This legislation is without parallel in British Colonies. We have, therefore, after other efforts had become vain, publicly entered into a solemn covenant not to submit to the Registration Law above-named and another passed in the year 1908, whilst the struggle was yet going on, until the Registration Act of 1907 is repealed so as to remove the racial taint.
 By reason of the covenant, over 2,500 Indians, respresenting all  races, classes, and religions, have undergone imprisonment. Many Indians domiciled in the Transvaal or in some other South African Colony have been, by arrangement with  the Portuguese administration at the Province of Mozambique, deported direct to India, at a moment’s notice, in some cases leaving families and businesses behind uncared for and unattended. Many homes have been ruined. Many merchants have been reduced to poverty. Many families are being supported out of charitable funds collected by the Indian community.
 We do not desire unrestricted Indian immigration into the Colony. We accept the principle of white predominance in this sub-continent. All we claim is that the Transvaal cannot, unlike the other Colonies, impose a racial test and thus, in the words of Mr. Chamberlain, wound the susceptibilities of India’s millions.
 We have appealed to all parties—all British subjects. And we have received support from all of them. Even in the Transvaal, a small European Committee, composed of prominent members of the community, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Wm. Hosken, M.L.A., has been supporting us.
 The honour of India, we doubt not, is as dear to Anglo-Indians as it must be to Indians. Through you, therefore, we ask the whole of Anglo-India to help us, in any
 manner you may consider best, to end the unfortunate situation.
 Owing to the almost unbearable severity of the struggle, many have succumbed. But the heroic band still continues to court imprisonment again and again. They are determined to fight unto death. The Transvaal gaols contain, at the time of addressing this appeal, nearly 200 Indian conscientious objectors. The Government have, for the purpose evidently of gagging us, arrested five  such objectors, who were chosen as delegates to proceed to India and England. We pray for relief.

       CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX XXII  LORD AMPTHILL’S 	LETTER TO GANDHIJI         July 	29, 1909 
 DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  I 	have just returned home to find your letter of yesterday. I write 	hastily to reply in the midst of a local “tamasha”.  Nothing 	would be more unfortunate than that Sir Mancherjee and I should be 	at cross purposes and that must be avoided at all costs.  I 	cannot “insist”, as 	you tell me 	that Sir 	Mancherjee does; I 	can only advise. It is for you to choose 	between his advice 	and mine.  Your choice lies between the “diplomatic” and the “political” method.  If 	you choose 	the former, 	then you must 	leave the conduct 	of the 	business entirely 	to me just 	as the 	Cabinet leave their 	diplomacy entirely to Sir 	Edward Seely. 	Diplomacy is only possible through individual agency and by private action.  If, 	however, you 	choose the 	political method, 	then  I 	 will  stand  aside altogether 	so as to leave 	Sir Mancherjee 	a free 	hand.  I could 	not take 	part in a course of action which seems to me inappropriate and erroneous at the present juncture.  As 	the result of 	the past ten 	days’s work, I 	am in touch with Lord 	Crewe, Lord Morley, 	Lord Lansdowne 	and Lord Curzon 	on the 	one side and with Lord Selborne, 	General Smuts 	and Sir George 	Farrar on the 	other. I 	am to have 	a discussion 	with General 	Smuts next week, probably on 	Wednesday. All 	those I 	have named are 	open to 	a settlement.  My 	advice to you is that you should leave matters to me for the present 	seeing how far I have already gone, and that, if my negotiations 	should fail, you should then try Sir Mancherjee’s suggested course 	of action.  Please 	let me know as soon as possible what you decide.

       CONFIDENTIAL  APPENDIX XXIII  LORD AMPTHILL’S 	LETTER TO GANDHIJI         July 	28, 1909 
 DEAR 	MR. GANDHI,  I 	am away from home and have only just received your letter of the 	26th inst. I must reply 	hastily as it is past 	midnight and 	I am 	at the end of 	a long 	and tiring day, 	but as 	I am off again 	early tomorrow morning I 	shall lose much time if 	I do not write 	to you now. 	I have 	not been 	idle since I last 	wrote to you. 	I have 	had long 	talks with Lord 	Selborne, Lord Crewe, Sir George Farrar and I have also approached 	Lord Morley, General Smuts and others. Lord Curzon is working with me.  There 	is no fixed disinclination for a settlement on the part of any of 	the above-mentioned, but there is nothing to be gained by unduly 	pressing them or by any loud public action. Private negotiation is 	the only possible means.  In 	reply to 	your question, 	please let me 	see your “statement” 	and then I 	shall be 	better able to 	suggest what you 	should do 	with it. 	But I beg 	you not to publish 	or circulate 	anything without 	first consulting me. 	It would 	be fatal 	if any of the responsible 	statesmen were offended or 	put out at 	the present 	juncture. I may 	be too 	sanguine, but I 	really hope 	that they will agree upon 	a settlement 	if they 	are allowed to do so of their own accord. Now, I want an answer from you to this question:  If 	the Act of 1907 is repealed and if a promise is given that six 	Indians will be admitted to the Transvaal annually in the way you 	have proposed, will you be contented? Will that finally remove the 	sense of injustice and indignity under which the Indian community in 	the Transvaal is suffering?  Please 	let me know explicitly what I can say on this point, for the 	objection which I have to meet is the assertion that the Indians 	will never be contented, and that any concession will lead to fresh 	demands.  There 	is also much prejudice in high quarters on account of a belief that 	“Passive Resistance” in the Transvaal is being fomented and 	financed by the party of sedition in India who do not desire that 	the question should be settled. Please tell me how I am to meet this 	charge.  You 	may of course show this letter to your colleague and I should be 	obliged if you would show it to Mr. Ritch, as I have not time to 	write it all to him, but please do not show it to anyone else. 
      From 	a photostat of the handwritten original: S. N. 4965  Yours 	very faithfully,  AMPTHILL
