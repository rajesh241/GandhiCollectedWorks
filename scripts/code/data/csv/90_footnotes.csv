Gandhiji felt that 	this would largely defeat 	the end in 	view.

In the letter of invitation to the Conference to be held at Simla, the Congress and the Muslim League were asked to send representatives to enter into negotiation about a scheme based upon certain ‘fundamental principles’. Acceptance of the invitation thus implied acceptance of the proposed basis. This basis, Gandhiji felt, contained in it ‘the seeds of Pakistan’. When he expressed his apprehension about this, the members of the Cabinet Mission explained to him that by accepting the invitation the invitees committed themselves to nothing, but the Mission had to word the letter of invitation as they had done to bring in Jinnah. To Gandhiji this smacked of ‘double talk’. He immediately alerted his Congress colleagues and insisted upon their obtaining a clarification in writing from the Cabinet Mision before they accepted the invitation. This was done by an exchange of letters between the Maulana Saheb and Lord Pethick-Lawrence on the 28th and 29th April, 1946.”"
