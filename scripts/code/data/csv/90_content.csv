1,,"C. That of course is so;
but where differences of opinion of such a nature do crop up it is
quite possible for the two parties to come to an agreement if only
they will meet, sit down and try to arrive at a solution by a process
of give and take. From my experience I could tell you that the issue
is dispute and the difference to be reconciled cannot be considered
too difficult for arriving at an agreed solution. In international
affairs much bigger issues between Governments have been and are
being settled by that process. It will be necessary for the Congress
and the League each to come down a bit and meet.","
 G. Where are they to meet ? What is the half-way house that you want them to meet at ?"
2,,"C. There is something like
a confederation and a confederal Centre.","
 G. Would not a confederal Centre mean merely a gathering of representatives of Governments of Independent States ?"
3,,"C.
Yes.","
 G. And there would be no legislature of other auxiliary things which you find in a Centre of the usual type ?"
4,,"C.
No.","
 G. What about the sanction behind the decision which such a confederate machinery will take ?C. No doubt it will be a loose unit. But it is
 unnecessary for me to point out to you that the States of the American Union formed first a confederation which later on developed into a federation. There is no reason why a similar thing should not happen in India.
G. But you forget, however, some rather fundamental differences
 between the two cases. In the case of America the states were independent units which first formed a loose kind of union. They found that union did not satisfy their requirements and therefore developed the closer federal union that now exists. In India we have now a unitary state with a common Centre. You propose to scatter the units in this state.
 C. Oh, no. No, I am not scattering them.
 G. When I said you are now scattering them I did not intend to convey that you personally were doing or wanted to do so. I am only trying to put to you my understanding of the proposal that you apparently have under consideration, of forming a confederal union between the proposed Pakistan and the rest of India. To resume what I was saying, the units of the existing unitary Indian State will, if the Pakistan idea is accepted, be scattered and then given the option of grouping themselves as they like into two or more independent States and come together in a loose confederation in the hope that later on the deficiencies of such a confederal arrangement will compel them to convert the confederal into a closer federal union. In other words the ultimate development visualised is, so far as inter-relations between the units and the administration on common subjects are concerned, to bring them into more or less the condition in which they are today.
 C. I see your point, but if agreement has to be arrived at, we cannot altogether justify an acceptable or accepted solution on the basis of argument alone. We have got to take psychological considerations into account. All the same I do not wish you to take away from this conversation the idea that I am finally committed to the solution being found in the shape of a confederation.
G. I understand, but what psychological consideration are you
 thinking of ?
 C. Rightly or wrongly the Muslims have now very widespread amongst them the fear of Hindu domination and if India is to get on peacefully in the future they have  to be convinced that the political system that is to be set up will be one which will remove this fear.
G. I am all for doing everything that in reason is possible for
 removing this fear. But in the conditions of this country and taking into account the members of Muslims involved and the manner in which they are distributed it is difficult for anybody to agree that the removal of this fear can be accomplished only or even most successfully by setting up an independent State where, though the Muslims may be in a majority, there will be a very large population ofnon-Muslims to reckon with. What are the grounds for your hope that an agreement could be reached between the parties  and  how could the reaching of such an agreement be furthered ?
 C. Between you and me, I may tell you that in spite of all the violent speeches that have been made within the last two days at the Muslim Convention, leading representatives of the Muslim community are, even as we are talking now furiously thinking as to how best they could moderate their published demands so as to arrive at  a settlement with the other party and if a gentleman like you could go round Delhi and speak to your Muslim friends and bring them round to realise that if they did not show  a spirit of accommodation they stood the risk of the decision of the Mission going against them on the issue of Pakistan, it would be of great assistance.
G. All advice which may come from people like me is suspect in
 Muslim circles. Emotionally worked up as Muslim sentiment is today, the more effective method of making them climb down from their extravagantly high perch is for you or other members of the Mission giving to Jinnah as early as you can a broad hint that there was no likelihood of Pakistan being agreed to by the  Mission  or  His Majesty’s Government.
 C. No doubt that would be more effective, but the time is not yet for your making known even in an informal way what might be our ultimate decision even if we had reached one already.
G.  I should have thought that there could be no hesitation in  this
 matter. With all the background of your history in this country, your present position and the state system you have built up, it is impossible for a person like me to imagine that if you were put on  your conscience and asked to give a fair decision on the merits your judgment would be in favour of dividing the country into two or more
 
 independent States.
 C. I  quite appreciate  your point of view, but where agreement has to be arrived at, it may be necessary for the party even with the strongest case agreeing to accept something less than what it may rightly be considered entitled to in order to avoid a possible decision against them. Often in my practice at the Bar, parties with a very strong case for whom I  was appearing have come to me and said, “no doubt our  case  is very strong, but we do not know what the judge might finally decide. Meanwhile the other side is offering to compromise on terms which although less than what we are rightfully entitled to are still sure and certain. We have to place this against a possible adverse finding of the judge. Shall we accept those terms ?”
G. If the two main protagonists do come to a settlement, nothing
 could be more satisfactory. But the danger of a compromise is that the terms may be such, especially when they are dictated by pressure from a third party, as would not in the long run satisfy or be in the interests of the one party or the other or perhaps even both.
 C. There  is  that  point  no  doubt  but  has  not  it  happened  in Indian history already that the country has settled down to decisions which when given did not please any party, as the Communal Award for instance. G. The Communal Award has  no doubt been aquiesced in though everybody not  excluding  the Muslims have been loudly complaining against it. But its successful enforcement is due primarily to the fact that the British have been in power and also strong enough to force down even an unpopular decision of that sort. The conditions will, however, be very different if on the issue of Pakistan you give a decision of a similar nature. India will be declared independent. You will not be here to face the risk that will inevitably follow such a decision. You will not be doing a service to the country by giving a decision which will intensify communal conflict and lead perhaps to a civil war, the responsibility for tackling which will not be yours. So any decision that you give has more chance of being implemented successfully after you leave if it is one which is justifiable on the merits. If on the other hand it is one which attempts merely to decide the dispute between two antagonists by denying to each a portion of his claim, whatever the merits may be, it will leave a trail of trouble behind.
 C. I agree that there are risks but we are determined to see that a settlement is reached and if it is not reached by ageement between the parties, to give a decision ourselves.
G. I have always been a staunch supporter of the view that if the
 parties in this country do not come to an agreement, the British Government which is in power today cannot escape the responsibility of giving a decision. There are suggestions for arbitration.
 C. I know, but if the parties concerned agree to refer an issue like Pakistan for decision of a committee consisting of a Russain, a Turk and a Chinese, I cannot see why we should stand in the way. No doubt in view of all the connections that exist between us and India and the knowledge that we possess of conditions here there is justification for your view that the British should give a decision; but if the parties to the dispute themselves prefer to agree to abide by the decision  of  an  outside committee of the sort I mentioned, I cannot see why I should stand in the way. The main thing is the reaching of a settlement which both parties will accept.
G. Sir Stafford, as regards the constitution-making machinery, I
 presume you will agree that you cannot have two constitution-making bodies or I understand the suggestion has been made of two compartments of a single constitution-making body unless the decision is first taken in favour of Pakistan. Such a decision necessarily implies that provinces will have to  decide beforehand which constitution-making body or compartment of a single constitution-making body they will go into.
 C. Yes.
G. Similarly, Indian States will have to choose in a similar way.
 C. Yes, but we cannot rule out the possibility in that case of the Indian States wishing to have a constitution-making body of their own!
G. Are you contemplating seriously of these complications ?
 C. There are complications but the whole thing will depend  upon  the agreement reached on the question of Pakistan. That hurdle has to be crossed before everything else.
G. How do you propose to set up the constitution-making
 body? What is the authority which will constitute it ? By Act of Parliament ?
 C. (After some hesitation) I am afraid we have not thought this out. I should not think that an Act of Parliament is necessary for this purpose.
G. If not an Act of Parliament, there should be at least a
 proclamation of His Majesty. The matter is, you will agree,  big  enough not to be left to be provided for by a Press communique of the present Government of India or even by an announcement by the Viceroy.
 
 C. We shall no doubt go into this question. The main thing is that we should reach an agreement first on the issue of substance. When such agreement is reached we shall take the best advice that is available and implement it in the form most suitable.
G. What about the Indian States ? Do you think they will come
 in without standing out for things which it might be difficult to agree to ?
 C. I do not foresee any great difficulty from that quarter.
 G. What about Paramountcy ? Where will it rest after you  transfer power ?
 C. Paramountcy when we go will have to disappear. When India gets independence not only British India but every one of the Indian States will become independent.
G. All the 562 or 601 of them ?
 C. Yes, and when they so become independent it will be for each of them to negotiate fresh arrangement with the new Government of India.
G. This will be another additional complication which you will
 introduce as the result of your quitting power in India. It is difficult for me to think that you should expect 562 States each to negotiate seperately a new arrangement with the Government of India. Even now there are only about 40 States with treaties and they as well as the rest of the States are all really held together by the British power exercising paramountcy.
 C. But it is difficult to expect a State like Hyderabad with permanent treaty relations with the British Crown to agree to any arrangement over its head. It might well say whatever you and the new Government may do we refuse to recognise it.
 G. With such experience of Indian States as I possess, it is difficult for me to believe that an Indian State, even if it be Hydera-bad, could maintain the position that it will not acquiesce in the arrangements which are made by the paramount power. C. You are probably right in saying that even Hyderabad could not maintain such an attitude for long. But we cannot ignore our obligations. What is that you yourself would suggest ?
G. The natural thing. British power over Indian States is
 exercised through paramountcy. You are transferring power to Indian hands. The authority which takes your place in British India should exercise that paramountcy after you hand over power.
 C. That is not the law.
G. I cannot follow you. Was not it law in 1858 and in 1935 ?"
5,"April 10, 1946","C.
But surely if bad law was perpetrated in the past you would","
 not advise us to follow that example now.
 G. You are not squarely facing the problem. That bad law has been in force and all States have settled down to it for nearly  a century.
 C. We have certain obligations to States under paramountcy-protection for instance. We were able to discharge this obligation because there was the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force at our disposal. But the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force will not be available after India becomes independent. It would not be right for us to tell the States that as we are quitting India we are handing over our obligations to a new Indian Government which [do not] have such forces at its disposal and which therefore will not be in a position to implement those obligations. It is for the States to look out for themselves and if they are so minded, to make fresh trials with the new Government of India.
G. What do you mean when you say that the new Indian
 Government will not be in a position to implement their obligations of protection of Indian States ?
 C. It is obvious that the new Government will not have at its disposal a Navy and Air Force sufficient to defend even itself.
G. You are exaggerating the position. It is true that the Indian
 Navy and the Indian Air Force have to be greatly developed before they can be considered efficient parts of the armed forces of an independent India. But while they are being developed new India will certainly make other arrangements, for example by treaty with Britain, for having at its disposal their Naval and Air units to help her in defending the country. Defending the country will include defending the Indian States as well and it should not be impossible so to make arrangements with Britain that  the New  India Government  will be in a position to implement the obligations of paramountcy which it will inherit from the British power. Again, you surely do not think that in protecting Indian States British power had to place  any reliance worth mentioning on the Navy and Air Force. That protection was largely given by the Indian army and even from the commencement of the new regime, we shall have, according to the Commander-in-chief, an Indian Army which would be quite capable of providing fully for the internal defence requirements of the country.
 C. There is the other point that the treaties were made by the British Crown and therefore except with their consent the obligations could not be transferred by the Crown to any other authority.
 G. I have already said that you have effected these transfers twice in recent history. On the first occasion Rulers of States were not even consulted, I believe. That was in 1858 when the Crown took over the relations with Indian States from the East India Company and administered those relations through the  Governor-General  in Council, that is the Government of India. In 1935 this arrangement gave place to a new one under which the Crown withdrew the powers from the Governor-General in Council and vested them in a Crown Representative. Under independent India both the Governor-General in Council and the Crown Representative will presumably disappear. Their places will have to be taken by the new Government of what is now British India. If the transfer of paramountcy to this new Government could be effected with consent of Indian States and on terms, perhaps, which might be made more acceptable to them than those on which paramountcy is exercised today by the Crown Representative it will be to the good, but if all or some of the States should hesitate as regards this transfer it has to be made in spite of such hesitation, for otherwise not merely the defence and foreign policy of India, but even the efficient internal administration of common economic and other matters will become almost impossible.
 C. Formerly it was the Governor-General that was controlling the Indian
  States.    You are mistaken. The authority that was in law responsible  
  	for the conduct of relations with Indian States was, from 1858 to 	1935, the Governor-General in Council and not the  Governor- 	General.  C. 	But then the Governor-General under that system was an autocrat and 	exercised all powers. G. 	That may have been so but I thought you were placing  	insistence on the letter of the treaties and on the legal position 	as regards the obligations of paramountcy and you cannot deny that 	from those two points of view the authority concerned was the 	Governor-General in Council and not the Governor-General up to 1935.  C. 	Have nothing more to say on the subject of Indian States.  G. There is one point I 	would like to draw your attention to. The enormous proportions which 	communal tension has reached in the country are directly traceable 	to separate electorates. You cannot have healthy political life in 	any country where the electorates which 
 should exercise the sovereign controlling power are based upon religion, race, creed or caste. If in connection with the negotiations you are now engaged in, it is possible as part of the agreement which you propose to see arrived at between the parties you can put pressure on them for substituting joint electorates for separate electorates, it will be a service of incalculabe value to the future political development of India.
 C. I am all with you as regards separate electorates. But don’t you think that we should rather not touch that question but leave it to the Interim Government and the constitution-making body ?
G. The immediate matter for settlement no doubt is the issue of
 Pakistan, the formation of an Indian Government and the convening of a constitution-making body. But I thought it would be helpful to the Interim Government and the constitution-making body if while pressure is being applied on both parties for a settlement on the major issue of Pakistan this important problem of electorates is also tackled and that even if a final decision is not arrived at on it now the way could be paved for a fairly satisfactory solution at the proper time. Let me add that separate electorates are unhealthy not only to the Government of a united India; in fact if Jinnah has his way about Pakistan—which God forbid—separate electorates will prove a greater headache to Pakistan than to Hindustan. The Muslim minority in the Hindustan of Jinnah’s conception will be 20 millions against a Hindu population in the same area of about 150 millions. On the other hand the non-Muslim minority in Pakistan will be 44 millions against a Muslim population therein of about 70 millions.
 C. Oh ! That is Jinnah’s Pakistan ! It is an impossible idea. To think of setting up a new State of Pakistan with so heavy a Hindu minority of 44 millions which will always be in opposition to the Government of Pakistan ! It is inconceivable. I think you will agree that this question of electorates is left over for decision by the constitution-making body.
After a few final words of courtesy we parted. At the door Sir
 Stafford said he hoped he would have an opportunity of meeting me again and added with a twinkle in his eye “before we leave this country at the end of July”. I turned round to him and said, “July !” Sir Stafford then said, “I do hope we shall be able to leave earlier but  I thought I would mention a safe limit !”

   SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW  DELHIlibtech_551_footnote  
 April 10, 1946
 In that hymn there is an assurance that whom God protects, no power on earth can injure. The message of that hymn has a particular relevancy in the present times when the whole world is plunged in strife. Although the war has ended, the causes that bought it about still continue. This is not peace; it is only silent preparation for another war.
 Look at the mutual recrimination, abuse and threats of violence that poison the atmosphere in Delhi itself. But, if you have faith in God, you will remain unaffected by all these threats and abuse, and feel secure in the assurance that not a hair of your head will be injured so long as you are under God’s protecting care. There is a saying to the effect that the outer is only the reflection of the inner. If you are good, the whole world will be good to you. On the contrary, if you feel tempted to regard anybody as evil, the odds are that the evil is within you.
 The   Choudhari   Saheblibtech_552_footnotehas   had   great   regard   for   me.      If, therefore, somebody comes and tells me that he  has  abused  the Hindus and called them names, I must refuse to believe it or think ill of him. How can a person who till yesterday was like a blood-brother to me turn all of a sudden into a hater of Hindus? I would rather think that some Hindus has exasprated him by their behavior and made him lose his balance. Similarly I am quite sure that if the Choudhary Saheb were to meet me today and I were to ask him if he really believed that the whole mass of Hindus had turned bad overnight, he would laugh at the remarks attributed to him and dismiss them as absured. We must neither think evil about others nor suspect others of thinking evil about us. Proneness to lend ear to evil reports  is a sign of lack of faith.

Niranjan Singh Gill,  speaking for 	 the I.N.A. 	prisoners in the 	Red Fort, had told him that they were finally 	convinced that 	India could not win or 	retain her 	independence except 	through non-violence.       
 They had further assured him that after their release they would serve India as true soldiers of non-violence. “We shall disdain to depend on anybody’s charity for our support,” they had told him. “We would rather dig the ground and till the land than compromise our self-respect by living on subscriptions.” Gandhiji said :
I told them that they would be sadly disillusioned, if they
 thought that a free India would be able to provide them all those emoluments, honours and perquisites which a foreign Government gave to the army men by the exploitation of the masses, while education, public health and the allied nation-building activities were starved. India was a poor country, her children were born in poverty and grew up in poverty into anaemic, stunted specimens of humanity. If they wanted to become true soldiers of India, they must be prepared to share her destitution and try to ameliorate it to the best of their capacity, not expect to be pampered at the cost of the poor. A true soldier would prefer death to charity. In reply, they assured me that Netaji had inculcated upon them the twin lessons of poverty and equality.
 Among us, officers and men live together and dine together without any distinction. There is no high, no low.libtech_562_footnote
 Continuing, Mahatma Gandhi mentioned how he had asked the military officer-in-charge of the camp whether the I.N.A. personnel were well-behaved. The officer had replied that he was very pleased with their behaviour. The I.N.A. people on their part had no complaint to make about the treatment they were receiving. He considered all that to be a very healthy sign.  He interpreted it as indication of things  to come. A free India would not want to harbour bitter memories against anyone and would like to make friends with all including the Britishers.
 In conclusion, he referred to the labours of the Cabinet Mission and suggested that all should pray during the National Week so that God might guide them as well as the people into right at this critical juncture in India’s history.

   WHAT ABOUT WOMEN? libtech_563_footnote  
 I am glad to read your replylibtech_564_footnoteto the complaint that enough women have not been put up for elections or selected for official posts.	Neither in the
 ministries and legislatures nor in local bodies is merit given first cosideration in the matter of selection of candidates. Consideration in the matter of selection of candidates. Consideration of caste, community and province come into the picture and are the determinig factors. The argument proffered in favour of such action is that none of these interest can be ignored. If the argument holds, what about the interests of women ? . . .
The above is from the letterlibtech_565_footnotelibtech_566_footnoteof an esteemed sister.  The sister’s
 argument boils down to this, that where everything is on a wrong basis, another wrong will not matter. But, if we go on thus, the evil will grow and we shall be hopelessly caught in a vicious circle. My appeal to women, therefore, is that they should intelligently become the personi- fication of renunciation and thereby not only adorn but also raise the status of their sex and the nation.
 So long as considerations of caste and community continue to weigh with us and rule our choice, women will be well-advised to remain aloof and thereby build up their prestige. The question is as  to how best this can be done. Today few women take part in politics and most of these do not do independent thinking. They are content to carry out their parents’ or their husband’s behests. Realizing their dependence, they cry out for women’s rights. Instead of doing this, however, women workers should enrol womenas voters, impart or have imparted to them practical education, teach them to think indepen- dently, release them from the chains of caste that bind them so as to bring about a change in them which will compell men to realize women’s strength and capacity for sacrifice and give her places of honour. If they will do this, they will purify the present unclean atmosphere. So much for women.
 As to men, they should consider it their duty to come out of the impure atmosphere wherever it exists. They will not beguided by cosiderations of caste and community, if these are banished from their own minds. The best and easiest way to achieve this is for both men
 
 
 and women to stoop to conquer by becoming Harijans and that too of the last class., i.e., Bhangis or Mehtars.
 Where capable women have been left out, men should make amends. It is their duty to give such encouragement to women as will enable them to outshine men. If both parties act as suggested, the atmosphere will soon become pure. Whether men do so or not, women’s duty is, to my mind, clear.

   LETTER TO SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS  
 NEW  DELHI,
 April 12, 1946
 DEAR SIR STAFFORD,
 What I wanted to say and forgot last night was about the States of India. Pandit Nehru is the President of the States’ People’s Conference and Sheikh Abdullah of Kashmir its Vice-President. I met the committee of the Conference last Wednesday. Their complaint was that they were ignored by the Cabinet Delegation whereas the Princes were receiving more than their due attention. Of course this may be good policy. It may also be bad policy and morally indefensible. The ultimate result may be quite good, as it must be, if the whole of India becomes independent. It will then be bad to irrritate the people of the States by ignoring them. After all the people are everything and, the Princes apart from them nothing. They owe their artificial status to the Government of India but their existence to the people residing in the respective States. This may be shared with your colleagues or not as you wish. It is wholly unofficial as our talk last night was.
 Yours sincerely,
 M. K. GANDHI

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING, NEW DELHI  
 April 12, 1946
 When I look at you I find very few people wearing khaddar. It is a sign of our misfortune.  It is estimated that we pay over seven
 
 crores of rupees in purchasing foreign cloth. We used to supply cloth to the whole world, but today all of our trade in textiles is gone.
 Since 1919 we have been trying to revive it. The  Charkha Sangh has chalked out a programme for the revival of khadi. Some people sell away all the yarn they spin because they get money for it, and when asked if they have kept yarn for their own use, they say that they could get cheaper cloth made in Manchester or Japan. Khaddar should occupy a higher status, if we really want to attain swaraj through it. The yarn should be spun and woven into cloth in the villages.
 People should go to Khadi Bhandars and get the cloth in return for handspun yarn.

   FASTING  IN  THE 		 AIRlibtech_567_footnote  
 Fasting has become a veritable epidemic. The blame lies at your door.
So writes a correspondent and adds :
 One can understand the efficacy of a fast for purpose of inward purification as also for the outward. But fasts are undertaken nowadays for an increment in one’s own pay or in that of one’s group, for being selected as a candidate for the Assembly or for various other causes. You encourage one man for fasting for the removal of untouchability and yet you are willing to let another die who is doing the same for a different cause. Is this not injustice ? Should you not lay down rules as to when to fast and when not to, what should be its duration, should fruit-juices be taken or only water ? You talk of the inner voice where you are concerned. Would it not really be best, if you were to stop undertaking fasts yourself and stop others too?
 There is force in the above argument. It is, however, impossible to lay down rules. Experience alone can suggest rules. In particular cases it is open to a person to frame his own law or he can refer to me, if he believes me to be an authority. I have had the temerity to claim that fasting is an infallible weapon in the armoury of satyagraha. I have used it myself, being the author of satyagraha . Anyone whose fast is related to satyagraha should seek my permission and obtain it in writing before embarking on it. If this advice is followed, there is
 
 no need for framing rules, at any rate, in my lifetime.
 One general principle, however, I would like to enunciate. A satyagrahi should fast only as a last resort when all other avenues of redress have been explored and have failed. There is no room for imitation in fasts. He who has no inner strength should not dream of it, and never with attachment to success. But, if a satyagrahi once undertakes a fast from conviction, he must stick to his resolve whether there is a chance of his action bearing fruit or not. This does not mean that fasting cannot bear fruit [or is fruitless]libtech_568_footnote. He who fasts in the expectation of fruit generally fails. And even if he does not seemingly fail, he loses all the inner joy which a true fast holds.
 Whether one should take fruit-juice or not depends on one’s physical powers of endurance. But no more fruit-juice than is absol- utely necessary for the body should be taken. He probably has the greatest inner strength who takes only water.
 It is wrong to fast for selfish ends, e. g. for increase in one’s own salary. Under certain circumstances it is permissible to fast for an increase in wages on behalf of one’s group.
 Ridiculous fasts spread like plague and are harmful. But when fasting becomes a duty, it cannot be given up. Therefore I do fast when I consider it to be necessary and cannot abstain from it on any score. What I do myself I cannot prevent others from doing under similar circumstances. It is common kowledge that the best of good things are often abused. We see this happening every day.

  From 	a copy of the Gujarati : Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy : Pyarelal      SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETING,  NEW  DELHIlibtech_570_footnote    April 13, 1946 Today is the last 	day of the National Week which I have also called the Sacred Week.  	It was on this day that the tragedy of the Jallianwala 	Bagh was enacted.  The 6th of April [1919] saw the birth  	of satyagraha in India. The awakening among the masses resulting 	from it was so phenomenal that the Government could suppress it only 	by having recourse to the method of frightfulness. It culminated in 	the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, when Gen. Dyer with a party of fifty 	sepoys opened fire on an unarmed people and the wounding of thrice 	that number. There was only one exit and it was held by the firing 	party so that the innocent men and women who were trapped there     
 had no alternative but to be shot down like rabbits in a hole. It is true some excesses were committed by the mob before the massacre. But they were nothing as compared to the savage reprisals taken by the Government. That is the way of all imperialisms. In no other way could a handful of foreigners maintain their rule over a nation of 400 millions.
 Why have I recalled these incidents? Not to stir up bitter old memories or to keep alive the embers of hatred, but only to emphasize the distinction between the old order which they symbolized and the new that is in sight. I have not the slightest doubt as to the bona  fides of the Cabinet Mission. I am convinced that they have finally made up their mind to withdraw in toto. The question which is exercising their mind is how to effect the withdrawal in an orderly manner and to that end their energies are bent. This is not the occasion to rake up old sores.libtech_571_footnoteGentlemanliness requires that if a person is sincerely trying to make amends, he should be thanked and congratulated for it, not that his past should be flung in his face.
 You know Shri Jayaprakash Narayan and Dr. Lohialibtech_572_footnotelibtech_573_footnote.   Both  of them are daring men of action and scholars. They could easily have become rich. But they chose the way of renunciation and service. To break the chains of their country’s slavery was their one passion. Naturally the alien Government regarded them as dangerous to its existence and put them into prison. We, however, have different scales  to weigh merit, and we regard them as patriots who have sacrificed their all for the love of the country which has given them birth. That they would be found wanting in the scales of non-violence is irrelevant today. What is relevant is that independence of India is today common ground between the British and ourselves. Their freedom, therefore, is no longer considered dangerous by the Government. Viewed in that light, their release as also the release of the I.N.A. men yesterday, must be regarded as an earnest of  the honesty of the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy. We must be thankful to them for this earnest, and prayer of thankfulness should ascend to heaven for the wisdom with which God seems to be endowing them.
 The Satyagraha Week which is closing today is devoted always to communal unity and khaddar. Communal unity is not confined to Hindus and Muslims only, it extends to all including Englishmen. It
 
 must not become a menace to anybody or group. That is the message of non-violence.
The National Week is a week of self-introspection and prayer.
 Prayer is not for the impure in heart.

   DISCUSSION  WITH  WOODROW  WYATTlibtech_574_footnote  
 [April 13, 1946]libtech_575_footnote
 WOODROW WYATT : Do you think we are getting off your backs at last ?
 [GANDHIJI :] I have no doubt as to the sincerity of your intention. The question is whether you will have the strength and  courage needed for it. It is so difficult to get out of conventional groves of thought and action.
 We must not precipitate a solution. We must let India decide for herself. At the same time, one does not want to leave the country to chaos when an unprecedented famine threatens it.
Your difficulty will remain so long as you retain the belief that
your rule that benefited India. None of us believes it.
 One or two have testified to the contrary.
 That is neither here nor there. I too believed it once. Such benefit as has really accrued to India is not part of foreign rule but is the result of contact with a robust people. The good is incidental, the evil of foreign rule is inherent and far outweighs the good. Commual division in India can be demonstrably proved to be a British creation. Even famine as we know it today is your creation.libtech_576_footnote
 Mark the true meaning of my words. Famines may be said to be godsend. But a well-equipped country should be able to pull through a deficiency period and not helplessly succumb. Famines in India today are not due to rain or lack of it merely, but due to the fact that India is ill-equipped to tide over the dry periods. Nothing has been done to safeguard her population against the threat of recurring famines. Take south Africa. There they fight against the locusts, drought, etc., manfully and with infinite resourcefulness. Here famine
 
 
 is simply blamed on the rain gods, and there is nothing to be done for it.
 Would India have been better equipped, if Britain had not been here ?
 Yes,  there  would  have  been  no  railways.libtech_577_footnoteIf  there  were  no railways, etc., we would be living in a natural state as they used to in England and Europe in the Middle-Ages when every feudal baron had his castle with its stocks of grain and water. Before the advent of railways in India, every village had its granary. In that sense we were better equipped. Moreover we had our system of domestic crafts to fall backupon, if crops failed. Now railways have depleted the countryside of its stocks and killed the handicrafts. Whatever cash the cultivator gets in return for his produce runs through his fingers like water, thanks to the invasion of his economy by the revenue collector and the imported foreign goods without which he thinks he can no longer do. The British have told him : ‘Do not stock grain, do not hoard silver.’There is no provision made for a  deficit  period. Railways have become a snare, cheap transport, a trap. The Princes practised tyranny in olden times too. But it could not go far. The natural means of redress, viz. insurrection, retreat or migration, were still open to the people. They were not then disarmed or emasculated. Odds were even. Today the odds are so heavy that a handful of British soldiers can terrorize millions. That is what British rule has done to us. It is most domoralizing. The British must realize this and leave us in an exemplary manner. If the virus has gone so deep that it cannot be cured without applying a strong blister, even then they must go. A few lakhs might be killed in internecine warfare but, real peace will come at last.
 But it is a big responsibility to leave India with anarchy.
 Not a bigger responsibility than you were prepared to face during the war out of strategic cosiderations.libtech_578_footnote
 Supposing we imposed what we considered to be a just solution and went?
All would be upset.
 So it must be left to India’s decision ?
 
 
 Yes, leave it to the Congress and the League. Thanks to Jinnah’s genius and British co-operation, he had built up a powerful organization comprehending not all but the major part of the Muslims. I will advise you to try him and, if you feel he cannot deliver the goods, take the Congress into your confidence. But in
any case the British occupation must end forth with.
 And what happens after the British leave ?
 Probably there will be arbitration. . . . But there might be a blood-bath. It will be settled in two days by non-violence, if I can persuade India to go my way, or the ordeal may last longer. Even so it would not be worse than what it is under the British rule. .. .
 Suppose we set up an Interim Government and went ?	If the Congress
 concedes Pakistan, it will then be their job.
 That will be a good beginning. Even if the whole of India goes under the League in this way, it won’t matter. It won’t be the Pakistan of Jinnah’s conception. India would then have something to live for and die for.
 Whom shall we put in the place of the present Government?
 You can ask the elected legislators to nominate their represen- tatives. Supposing the Congress has an overwhelming majority, she will choose the names for the Interim Government. If the Congress can come to terms with the League, there will be no difficulty. But if Jinnah should ultimately choose not to come in, Congress and you must not be frightened. Or, as I have already said, you let Jinnah nominate out of the present legislators. Supposing the Muslim League starts
 destruction, will you jail them ?
 I won’t. But, maybe, the Congress will decide to fight. It will then be a clean fight, not the cowardly hit-and-run that you see today or taking of a hundred lives for one a la the British.libtech_579_footnote

   A MINISTER’S WOE  
 Dr.  Katjulibtech_581_footnotelibtech_582_footnotesends the following notelibtech_583_footnotelibtech_584_footnote:
 Owing to the comparative failure to winter crops. . . rationing has been introduced in many urban areas in the United Provinces. . . The Government of India has suggested to Provincial Governments that in order to ensure continuous supplies, it would be desirable to enforce compulsory levies on agricultural produce in surplus districts. . . This question of a compulsory levy is greatly agitating the public mind. It is said that the control price fixed by the Government is too low and should be raised. The answer to that is, that  the price structure is an all-India affair and it is not possible to raise the price  in any particular province without affecting the structure as a whole. . . There  is bound to be a black market where selfish people can buy foodstuffs at higher prices to satisfy their individual needs. No compulsion would be necessary if cultivators realize that it us their social and patriotic duty to do their utmost to feed their brothers and sisters. . . I ask you to appeal to him at this critical juncture not to hoard, not to sell in the black market but to supply in the greatest measure possible to the Government stores. . . We are doing our very best to encouragee the ‘Grow More Food’ and ‘Grow More Vegitables’ campaigns in the United Provinces. The various suggestionslibtech_585_footnotemade by you have all been adopted. . . .

   INDIAN PRESSMEN v. EUROPEAN  
 An Indian journalist complains that our great men have a weakness for foreign journalists to the extent of excluding Indians at their Press conferences, and wonders whether I am myself free from this weakness.  For myself, I can say without fear of contradiction that  I have never been guilty of such partiality. Having suffered to good deal for the crime of being an Asiatic, I am not likely to be guilty of such weakness. And I must say that I know of no such example as my friend adverts to, if only because pubic men can ill afford to face a boycott by Indian Pressmen. What has happened with me and, so far as I am aware, with others too is that they and I found it necessary at times to give special interviews to foreign journalists when it has been found necessary in the interest of the common cause to gate messages across the seas. It is impossible in the present circumstances to do otherwise. It would be as foolish to invite a boycott by foreign journalists as by Indian. Any industrious person will find out that Indian journalists have been more often than not preferred by Indian pubic men again for the sake of the common cause. As a fellow journalist I would urge journalists, whether Indian or foreign, to prefer their particular causes to their employers’ pockets or to descending to recriminations or personalities.

   WHAT A KHADI-LOVER SHOULD KNOW  
 The foregoing articlelibtech_593_footnoteis full of useful information.  Khadilovers will not have read it in vain.
 Every day I am getting more and more convinced that  we should as soon as possible stop using machine-made slivers. They present us from making the villages self-supporting and they will surely let us  down at  the time of  real  need.  Again,  it  is  not   in the least consistent with our  way  of  thinking  that  these  slivers should go to or be sold at Madras or Bombay. Neither the poor  nor  the  rich  are  benefited  thereby.  The only  purpose  served  is that somehow khadi is supplied to those who wear it. I do not think that this is the aim of the Charkha Sangh. The experiment being carried on by Shri Vinoba these days is signficant and is worth knowing. One of his experiments eliminates carding. In the cotton- growing areas the cotton pods are picked up directly from the fields, the shell is removed, the seeds are separated from the cotton with the help of a roller and the cotton is spun straightway. Shri Vinobaji has
 
 coined the expression punai libtech_594_footnoteto denote this process. But  hand- carding has to be there and wil remain. There also carding is eliminated, if desired. This process simplifies the work to a great extent. The results so far are encouraging. The yarn spun by this process has already been woven. If this thing works well, much time and labour will be saved. Whatever the count of yarn that is spun by this process, it is found to be strong to that extent. Wherever men like Shri Diwanji are making experiments we should, I think watch the results carefully. Every worker should decide for himself  how  speedily these improvements can be introduced in his area.
 As a general rule, machine-carding should cease immediately and slivers should not be sold beyond the taluka.
 The second experiment is to reel the yarn in double thread before weaving. This experiment has already proved a success. Shri Vinoba is examining what further improvements are possible in this direction. Double-thread reeling is an easy process and all should learn it. Vinobaji is of the opinion that weaving will become easier and less costly if people who exchange yarn for cloth will give double- reeled yarn. That means, the yarn reeled in this way can compare well with mill-yarn. Such yarn does not need any starching.

   QUESTION  BOXlibtech_595_footnote  
 
 Q. On what principle is the question of the salaries of ministers in Congress majoriy provinces going to be settled this time? Does the Karachi resolutionin this regard still hold? If the question is to be settled on the basis of the present high prices, is it possible, within the limits of their revenues, for the provincial budgets to increase the pays of all their servants threefold? If not, will it be proper for the ministers to be paid Rs. 1,500 while a chaprasi or a teacher is told to make the two ends meet on Rs. 15 and 12 p. m. and not make a fuss about it because Congress has  to run the administration?
 
 
 
 
 
 A. The question is apt. Why should a minister draw Rs. 1,500 and a chaprasi or a teacher Rs. 15 p. m.? But the question cannot be solved by the mere raising of it. Such differences have existed for ages. Why shoud an elephant require an enormous quantity of food and a mere grain suffice for the ant? The question carries its own answer. God gives to each one according to his need. If we could as definitely know the variations in the needs of men as those of the elephant and the ant, no doubts would arise. Experience tells us that differences in requirements do exist in societylibtech_596_footnotelibtech_597_footnote.  But we do not know the law governing them. All therefore that is possible today is to try to reduce the differences as far as possible. The reduction can be brought about by peacefu agitation and by the creation of public opinion. It cannot be done by force or by duragraha in the name of satyagraha. The ministers are the people’s men. Their wants even before they took office were not those of chaprasis. I would love to see a chaprasi become worthy of holding the office of a minister and yet not increase his needs. It should also be clearly understood that no minister need draw up to the maximum of the salary fixed.
 It is worth while pondering over one thing that  arise  out  of  the questions.  Is  it  possible  for  the  chaprasi  to  support  himself and his family on Rs. 15 p. m. without taking bribe?  Should  he  not be given enough to keep him above temptation? The remedy for this is that as far as possible we should we our own chaprasis. But even so if we need them we must pay them enough for their requirements. In this way the big gulf that exists between a minister and a chaprasi will be bridged.
 It is another matter as to why the pay of the ministers has been raised from Rs. 500 to 1,500 p.m. But this is nothing as compared with, and does not solve, the main problem. With the solution of the latter it will ipso facto be solved.

   		“ROMAN URDU”  
 If there is Roman Urdu, why nat Roman Hindi? The next step will be to Romanize the alphabets of all the languages of India. They have done this for Zulu which had no alphabet of its own. The attempt in India would be on a par with the attempt to foist Esperanto on the world. It cannot succeed in the near future. Believers in the Roman script in the place of all the known Indian scripts will have a circle of adherents but the movement cannot permeate the masses. It should not. Crores of people need not become so lazy as not to learn their own respective scripts. A laudable attempt is being made  not to replace the alphabets in vogue in India but to teach Nagari in addition in the hope that in course of time millions may learn to read the Indian languages in the Nagari character. And since Urdu characters cannot for well-known reasons be replaced by Nagari, it should be learnt by all the patriots who love their country too well to find the learning of the Urdu alphabet a burden. All these attempts seem to me to be worthy.
 With all my readiness to grasp new ideas, I have failed to find a substantial reason for inducing the spread of the Roman alphabet for the purpose of replacing the Nagari or Urdu script. It is true that in the Indian Army, the Roman alphabet has been largely used. I  should hope that the Indian soldier, if he is saturated with the national spirit , will not mind learning both Nagari and Urdu charachers. After all, amid the ocean of Indian humanity, the Indian soldier is a mere drop. He must shed the Eng-lish mode. Probably the reason for Romanizing Urdu will be found in the English officer being too lazy to learn to read Urdu or Nagari characters.

   MY  ADVICElibtech_599_footnote  
 NEW DELHI,
 April 15, 1946
 Shri Prakasamlibtech_600_footnoteI have known as a worker for many years. He has somehow developed a philosophy that a public worker is entitled to receive purses from the public for his expenses. In pursuance of that phiosophy he has received a considerable sum in the shape of purses. Those who collected them have wired or written to me that they saw nothing wrong in so doing or in Shri Prakasam receiving them. Some have gone so far as to say that Shri Prakasam should even became a member of the Madras ministry, if not the Prime Minister.
 With the greatest reluctance I must dissent from the whole view. I know that Shri Prakasam says that he has changed his mind. Sudden conversions are not unknown. But they are cast in a different mould.  A ministership cannot be the end of genuine repentance and conversion. My advice to Shri Prakasam is that he should retire even from the Legislative Assembly and brood over the bad example he has set. There is ample field open to everyone for silent service which  is often much greater than service done in the limelight.

   SWEEPERS’  STRIKElibtech_601_footnote  
 There are certain matters in which strikes would be wrong. Sweepers’ grievances come in this category. I do not want to go into others here. My opinion against sweepers’ strikes dates back to about 1897 when I waslibtech_602_footnotein Durban.  A general strike was mooted there and the question arose as to whether scavengers should join in it. My vote was registered against the proposal. Just as man cannot live
 
 
 without air so too he cannot exist for long if his home and surroundings are not clean. One or other epidemic is bound to break out especially when modern drainage is put out of action.
 Therefore I was perturbed when I read about the  sweepers’ strike in Bombay. Fortunately it has come to an end. I understand, however, that the sweepers, both men and women, refused to submit their case to  arbitration.libtech_603_footnote
 In spite of my close attachment to sweepers, better because of  it, I must denounce the coercive methods they are said to have employed. They will thereby be losers in the long run. City folk will not always be cowed down. If they were, it would mean the collapse of municipal administration. Coercion cannot but result in the end in chaos. An impartial tribunal for settling disputes should always be accepted. Refusal is a sign of weakness. A Bhangi may not give up his work even for a day. And there are many other ways open to him of securing justice.
 Towns people should on the other hand, forget that there is such a thing as untouchability and learn the art of cleaning their own and the city’s drains, so that if  a  similar  occasion  arises  they  are not nonplussed and can render the necessary temporary service. They may not be coerced. I go so far as to say that the military who know this work should be used for such emergency. If swaraj is round the bend, we can now look upon the military as ours and need have no hesitation in taking all the constructive work we can from them. Up till now they have only been employed in indiscriminate firing on us. Today they must plough the land, dig wells, clean latrines and do every other constructive work that they can, and thus turn the people’s hatred of them into love.
 Now that the hartal libtech_604_footnoteis at an end, it is the duty of everyone, to stretch out the hand of fellowship to the Bhangis, educate them, see that they are properly housed, permit them, like anyone else, to live wherever they choose, look into the matter of an equitable wage for them and see that justice is meted out to them without their having to
 
 
 demand it. If this is done throughout India we shall definitely prove ourselves worthy of swaraj and be able also to maintain it.

      NOTE  TO  BABA  RAGHAVDASlibtech_606_footnote        NEW 	DELHI, 
  April 	15, 1946  	The suggestion for not accepting office greatly appeals to me. Carry 	on silently whatever constructive work, you can. These are difficult 	times. If all want power who will render silent service? [From 	Hindi]  Hindustan, 	16-4-1946      SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_607_footnote    April 15, 1946libtech_608_footnote In 	a moment of introspection the poet asks himself:  	O man, why have you left off taking God’s name? You have not given 	up anger or lust or greed, but you have forgotton truth. What a 	tragedy to save worthless pennies and to let go the priceless gem of 	God’s love! Why would you not, O fool, renounce all vanities and 	throw yourself on the grace of God alone?  	This does not mean that if one has wealth, it should be thrown away 	and wife and children should be turned out of doors. It simply means 	that one must give up attachment to these things and dedicate one’s 	all to God and make use of His gifts to serve Him only. It also 	means that if we take His name with all our being we are 	automatically weaned from all lust, untruth and baser passions.       The 	addressee, who had just been released from jail, met Gandhiji and 	apprised him of 	the scramble 	for power 	among Congressmen. 	It being 	his silence day 	Gandhiji replied in writing.   
 In the first shloka libtech_609_footnoteof Ishopanishad that is repeated every day at the beginning of the prayer, one is asked to dedicate everything to God and then use it to the required extent. The principal condition laid down is that one must not covet what belongs to another. These two maxims contain the quintessence of the Hindu religion.
 In another shloka which is recited during the morning prayer it is said:
 I do not ask for temporal power, nor do I ask to go to heaven, nor  even to attain  nirvanalibtech_610_footnote.   What I ask for is that I may be able to relieve the pain of those who are in pain.
 The pain might be physical, mental or spiritual. Spiritual pain due to slavery to one’s passions is sometimes greater even than physical.
 But God does not come down in person to relieve suffering. He works through human agency. Therefore, prayer to God to enable one to relieve the sufferings of others must mean a longing and readiness on one’s part to labour for it.
 The prayer, you will note, is not exclusive. It is not restricted to one’s own caste or community. It is all-inclusive. It comprehends the whole of humanity. Its realization would thus mean the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on earth.

   MESSAGE  FOR  I. N. A.libtech_611_footnote  
 [Before  April 16, 1946]libtech_612_footnoteGandhiji’s reply covered not only the I. N. A. but all Indian army men. Although  the   I.   N.   A.   men   had   declared   open   rebellion   under   Netaji’slibtech_613_footnotelibtech_614_footnotelead
 the spirit of  rebellion was   not   confined to  them.	It	had  permeated   even  the
 
 Indian  Army  ranks.  Some  of  the   latter   had   seen   him   at   Poona   and   sought his advicelibtech_615_footnote. Gandhiji had told them that it was open to them to give notice to the authorities that though they were in their pay their loyalty was mortgaged to India, not to the King of England. Hitherto they had yielded obedience to military orders and been prepared even to shoot down their countrymen to order. But now that the spirit of independence had taken possession of them they would do so no more under a foreign Government’s order.
 For the I. N. A. men theref were two alternatives. They could serve free India as soldiers-in-arms or they could convert themselves into soldiers of non-violence if they were convinced that non-violence was the higher and the more efficacious way. They should make use of their training and discipline to introduce non-violent organization among the masses, learn spinning and become veteran constructive workers. If they did that, they would set a glorious example to the whole world.
The I.  N. A.  men	have shown great strength, heroism and
 resourcefulnes. But I must confess that their achievements have not dazzled my eyes. To die without killing  requires  more  heroism. There is nothing very wonderful in killing and being killed in the process. But the man who offers his neck to the enemy for execution but refuses to bend to his will shows courage of a far higher type.
 Troublous times lie ahead of us. Our non-violence has broght us o the gate of independence. Shall we renounce it after we have entered that gate? I for one am firmly convinced that non-violence of the brave, such as I have envisaged, provides the surest and the most efficacious means to face foreign aggression and internal disorder just as it has done for winning independence.
 The British were going to quit. What place would India have in the comity of nations? Would she be satisfied with being a fifth-rate power like China? China was independence only in name. India would have long to wait before she could become a first-class military power.
And for that she would have to go under the tutelage of some
 Western power. A trully non-violent India will have nothing to fear any foreign power nor will it look to British navy and air force for her defence. I know that we have not as yet the non-violence of the brave.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 April 16, 1946 Speaking after prayers on Tuesday evening Gandhiji explained the meaning of swadeshi. It hurt him deeply to see that after 25 years of repeeated exhortations the
 people had still not taken to swadeshi. Some people regarded Indian mill cloth as swadeshi. In his opinion, khadi alone was real swadeshi. The machinery in the mills was not made in India. Supposing in a free India they had their own engineers and were able to produce the machinery in India, he would still not call it swadeshi. He  did not want anything that might ruin the villages. Honest servants of the people would devote themselves to the service of the villages and to that purpose become poor with the poorest.
 Gandhiji expected all of them to take at least to khadi. What was the use of their attending the prayers, if they did not follow what they heard there? He had cried himself hoarse over khadi for the last 25 years.  But his non-violence taught him that he was to go on proclaiming what he considered to be the truth. It was not for him to lose temper or feel disappointed if the people did not listen to him.
 They might well ask him how they were to wear khadi when they could not get it in the khadi bhandars. Lack of khadi in the bhandars was of his doing. Just as foreign cloth even if it appeared to be cheap was not cheap in reality, similarly khadi produced at one place and sold at another could not serve the purpose that it was intended to serve. It was no use their wearing khadi without grasping the spirit behind it. Khadi had been called the livery of swaraj. It gave the wearer a certain respectable status.
 But if khadi was to be the symbol of non-violence and the livery of swaraj it had to be produced and used locally. Therefore he had asked the bhandars not to import khadi from other provinces. He had also asked them to sell it in exchange for yarn and to see that those who span for wages also wore khadi themselves. They were  not to accept the yarn from those spinners who span for wages but did not wear khadi themselves even though it might result in a temporary shortage of khadi. People were taking to the idea, but during the transition stage, some inconvenience might be experienced. The remedy was that they should spin for themselves and even engage handloom-weavers for weaving khaddar. There were many rich people in Delhi who could easily undertake this work.

 It was the fault of the parents, Gandhiji remarked.libtech_636_footnoteHe had never seen children playing in a church or a mosque.
 True culture requires that there should be perfect peace in the prayer ground at the time of the prayer.
 There should be an atmosphere of solemnity as in a church, a mosque or a temple. He knew that many of the temples were full of clamour. It had hurt him deeply.
 We go to the temple to worship not the stone or the metal image but God who resides in it. The image becomes what man makes of it.  It has no power independently of the sancitity with which it is invested by the worshipper. Therefore everyone, including children, should observe perfect silence at the time of prayer.libtech_637_footnote

  	I wrote the enclosed notelibtech_642_footnotefor  Harijan. It absolutely represents my 	confirmed view which I told you personally. But the members of the 	Working Committee were here last night, among them  Pandit Nehru and 	others. They had seen a copy of my note and they all thought that I 	should not publish it. I defended it strenuously but on turning it 	over in my mind last night I came to the conclusion that I would be 	taking perhaps an undue advantage of my public position to air my 	personal view. Instead, therefore, of allowing the note to be 	published in Harijan, I feel I should satisfy my conscience 	by sending a copy to you and letting you make what use you like of 	it. I would, however, like to emphasize the fact that if you allow 	yourself to be chosen as Prime Minister or hold any office or even 	be a member of Parliament, it will be bad for the country and of 	course for yourself.  	As I have said in the note, it will be apparent to you that your 	reconsideration against your minstership of your philosophy will be 	perfectly valueless and ludicrous.

   TALK  WITH  MADAN 		 MOHAN  MALAVIYAlibtech_650_footnote  
 April 18, 1946
 You would have covered me with shame if you had come to me instead of my going to you.
 Why do you lend a ready ear to such gossip?libtech_651_footnotelibtech_652_footnoteWhy can’t you take a leaf out of my book? If someone comes to me and talks to me about the Indian States, I send him off to Pandit Nehru. If it is about internal politics of the Congress, I give him Azad’s address. In this way I have rigorously restricted my ambit of work. Even so, I have hardly a moment’s respite. Unless I did that would have to give up the desire to live up to the age of 125 which I must not do, if any dream of non-violence as a world-conquering force is to be realized. You are a man of religion and purity of soul. It should need no argument on my part to convince you that if you completely empty your mind of outward things and fixing all your thoughts on Him inwardly pray, you will have more than contributed your share to the struggle for independence. You must complete your century. It  is  perfectly feasible if you will listen to my advice.
 Malaviya followed Gandhiji’s remarks with a. . . smile. . . “I must not engage you in talk any further,” he remarked, “I know you are always busy.“

   SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_653_footnote  
 April 18, 1946libtech_654_footnote
 As a result of his remarkslibtech_655_footnotechildren had ceased to play about in the prayer ground today and this quick response from parents and children evoked congratulations from Gandhiji and he emphasized the necessity of children coming to prayers in clean clothes and with clean bodies. Next he drew their attention to the growing number of newspapers and the undue importance that was being attached to
 
 
 them by the people.libtech_656_footnote
 The newspaper man has become a walking plague. In the East as in the West newspapers are fast becoming the people’s Bible,  Koran, Zend Avesta and Bhagavad Gita, rolled into one. All that appear in the papers is looked upon as God’s truth. For instance, a peper predicts that riots are coming, that all the stricks and knives in Delhi have been sold out and the news throws everybody into a panic. That is bed. Another newspaper reports the occurrence of riot here and there and blames the police of taking sides with the Hindus in one place and the Muslims in another. Again, the man in the street is upset. I want you all to shed this craven fear. It is not becoming of men and women, who believe in God and take part in the prayers, to be afraid of anyone.
 What if riots do actually take place  and  some  people  get killed? Everyone must die one  day.  I  will  expect  you  to  go  in the midst of the fracas and tell the rowdies to be sensible. A friend remarked in the course of the conversation the other day that whilst it was poor rowdies that killed and got killed in the riots, the real responsibility lay not with them but with educatad people, real responsibility lay not with them but with educated people, some of them occupying respectable places in society. It is they who incite others to violence from behind the scenes. It is for these educated and cultured people to stop the riots by laying down their lives in the process if necessary. Even a little girl can go up to the hooligans and tell them to desist. Most probably they will. But supposing they do not and kill her, it will be well with her all the same. She will live through her pure sacrifice. It is always well with those who believe in God and try to do His will to the best of their ability.
 Independence is coming. But our lungs appear to have lost the capacity to breathe the air freedom. But when  freedom  actually comes, you will find that the loss of the capacity was only apparent. Maybe, the first impact of freedom will give you a rude shock, and before you regain your equilibrium some undesirable things might take place. All that you need to do is to keep yourselves on the alert and undaunted and it will be well with you in the end.

   TALK  WITH  A  FRIENDlibtech_657_footnote  
 [Before April 19, 1946]libtech_658_footnote
 In talking to a friend the other day who was suggesting an expedient  to solve the political tangle, contrary to his inner conviction of the wrong of it, Gandhiji  told  him  that it  was  unworthy  for   a   man   of   faith   ever   to   believe that anything but  evil  could  be  born out  of  a  poisonous  germ.  The  friend replied, “The Cross was poisonous, full of hatred and ill will and yet redemption camed out of it.”
That is not my interpretation of the Cross. There was no poison
 there, no hatred, no fear. It was the way of self-suffering and therefore of love and hence the story of redemption.

   SOVEREIGN REMEDY  
 . . . Your new note in nature cure—reciting of Ramanama as the sure remedy—leaves me completely bewildered. The modern youth refrains from challenging some of your views out of toleration. Their attitude may be summed up in the following : ‘Well, Gandhiji has taught us a whole lot of things; he has elevated us to unimaginable heights; he has, above all, brought swaraj within our reach; why not ‘suffer’ his Ramanama ‘fad’?
 Inter alia you have said the following :
 “No matter what the ailment from which a man may be suffering, recitation of Ramanama from the heart is the sure cure” (Harijan, 3-3-’46)libtech_659_footnote
 “Man should seek out and be content to confine he means of cure to the five elements of which the body is composed, i. e., earth, water, akashalibtech_660_footnote, sun and air” (Harijan, 3-3-’46).libtech_661_footnote
 “And my claim is that the recitation of Ramanama is a sovereign remedy for our physical ailments also” (Harijan, 7-4-’46).libtech_662_footnote
 At first, when you introduced this new note in the system of nature cure, I thought you were merely putting in other words a kind of psycho-therapy or Christian Science based on faith. I interpreted my first quotation above in
 that light. The second sentence quoted above is difficult to grasp. After all, it
 
 is physically impossible for medicines to be composed of anything but the five elements to which you refer, and which you say must be the sole means of cure.
 If faith is what you insist on I have no quarrel; it is necessary for the patient to co-operate in getting well also by faith. But it is difficult to accept that faith alone would cure “our physical ailment also”. Two years ago, my little daughter was struck by infantile paralysis; it was the most modern treatment that saved the child from becoming a cripple for life. You would agree that it would not avail to ask a two-and-a-half-year-old child to recite Ramanama to be rid of infantile paralysis; and I would like to see you persuade any mother to do the recitation (and recitation alone) on her child’s behalf.
 The authority from Charkalibtech_663_footnotethat you have quoted in the issue of March 24,libtech_664_footnoteleaves me cold; you have taught me not to accept anything, however ancient and however authoritative it may be, if it does not appeal to my heart.
 Thus writes a teacher of youth.libtech_665_footnoteWhile I am eager to be in the good graces of the student world, my eagerness has well-defined limitations. For one, I must please them with the rest of the world, which is admittedly much larger. In no case should a servant of the public pander to any person or class.
 If those whom my correspondent represents really think that anything I have done has taken India to unimaginable heights, they should extend to my so-called fads slightly more than toleration. Toleration by itself will do them and me no good. It may easily promote lazineses in them, and false self-assurance in me. Let them think well before rejecting even a fad. Faddists are not always to be despised. Fads have before now made owners mount the gallows.
 Ramanama has the flavour of faith-healing and  Christian Science; yet, it is quite distinct from them. Recitation of Ramanama is  a mere symbol of the reality for which it stands. If one of knowingly filled with the presence of God within, one is that moment free from all ailments, physical, mental or moral. That we do not see the type in life is not to disprove the truth of the statement. My argument is admittedly useless for those who have no faith in God.
 Christian scientists, faith-healers and psychotherapists may, if they will, bear witness somewhat to the truth underlying Ramanama. I cannot take the reader a long way with me through reason. How is one to prove to a person who has never tasted sugar, that sugar is sweet, except by asking him to taste it?
I must not reiterate here the conditions attendant upon the heart
 
 
 recitation of the sacred syllable.
 The authority of Charka is good for those who have some belief in Ramanama. Other may dismiss the authority from their consi- deration.
 Children are irresponsible. Ramanama is undoubtedly not for them. They are helpless beings at the mercy of their parents. They show what tremendous responsibility parents bear to them and society. I have known parents who have trifled with their children’s diseases even to the extent of trusting them to their (the parent’s) recitation of Ramanama.
 Lastly, the argument about everything, even medicines, being from panch mahabhutaslibtech_666_footnotelibtech_667_footnotebetrays a hasty confusion of thought. I have only to point it out to remove it.

 DELHI,
 April 19, 1946
 CHI. BHANSALI,
 I have gone through your letter three times—twice word by word and the third time for dictating a reply. By clinging to the letter  of the pledge we often come to observe it only in form. The spirit is the real thing which alone makes us aware of our understanding of it. Flawless observance is possible only after we achieve a harmonious blend of the letter and the spirit. It has always been painful to me because I have expressed such an opinion in the context of my vow to abjure milk. I see there is a subtle pride in  being  content  with  the observance of a vow in its spirit. I therefore do  not  deceive  myself. Literally according to my vow I gave up  animal  milk  for  all time, but since by milk is generally meant buffalo’s or  cow’s  milk and also because at the time of taking the vow I was not at all aware of any other milk, I took advantage of my own ignorance and started taking goat’s milk. Even then it did hurt my soul but some how I consoled my mind. Had I been able to stick to my resolve of abjuring all animal milk, possibly I might have been freed of this body. Nevertheless, my heart bears testimony to the fact that I have fulfilled my vow in letter as well as in spirit. If I were to apply the same rule to you, and I ought to, you should observe your pledge literally and stick to the Ashram. And by staying on you will also be observing it in spirit.
 Whereas other people felt that  the movementlibtech_671_footnotelibtech_672_footnotehad been in vain I never had any such feeling. Failure has no place in the vocabulary of satyagraha. Satyagraha has endless time [to operate]. It may not therefore care for [any outside] help. There is much more to it than I have said here. If I begin to expound it I will have to devote a lot of time to it, which you also would not want me to do. Let me therefore be quite having shown you what your dhrama is.
 
 
 I think you have raised a very good point. I am not shocked by  it at all.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 April 19, 1946
 Speaking after prayers on Friday, Gandhiji referred to his latest love—nature cure. He had believed in it for years. He felt that what he had shared with his freind and close associates so far should be shared with the masses poor villagers. He had been thinking of  the  villagers  in  particular  in  connection  with  the Kasturbalibtech_680_footnotework.
 Medical help had become an elaborate and costly affair nowadays. Those who could afford it called in a doctor who wrote out a prescription in a language unintelligible to the layman. The latter carried the prescription to the chemist, took the medicine and counted upon it to cure him. Apart from the utility of this method of treatment, it was beyond the reach of the masses.
 During his recent tour of Bengal and Madras lots of people had joined the prayers and in the mass singing of Ramdhun. He had since introduced Ramanama in
 
   1944.     
 nature cure as a panacea for all ailments whether physical, mental or spiritual.
 Physical ailments, Gandhiji continued, were not always the most serious.
 Those born of anger, lust, greed, infatuation, etc., were worse.
 Bad as is the loss of a limb, the loss of reason would be worse. Ramanama when it is uttered not merely by the lips but proceeds from the heart is the sovereign remedy for the triple woeslibtech_681_footnotelibtech_682_footnoteto which man is subject. Reason follows the heart.  It does not guide it.  A pure heart  is thus the most essential requisite not only for mental health but for physical too, and that could be had only through waiting on God— repeating Ramanama.
 No remedy on earth, Mahatma Gandhi proceeded, could cure all physical ailments. But Ramanama enabled one to put up with suffering bravely and calmly when it could not cure. Ramanama also stood for the natural and right way of living. That was why he had taken to nature cure in the evening of his life and thereby added another to his numerous burdens.

   TALK  WITH  S. 		 A.  AYERlibtech_683_footnote  
 [Before  April 20, 1946]libtech_684_footnote
 Shri S. A. Ayer of the Azad Hind Government came to discuss with Gandhiji the other day the question of issuing a news bulletin in the Roman script for the I. N.
 A. as proposed by the central I. N. A. Relief Committee.	“The men had got used to
 the Roman script while they were in the Indian Army and so retained it when they were operating in South East Asia.”
 You forget that you are not working in South East Asia today, but in India. May I ask if these men ever write to their wives and children in the Roman script?
 Never, they write one and all in Hindi, Urdu, Tamil or any of the other Indian scripts.
 This means that they all know one or the other Indian script. I could understand your wanting to adopt the Roman script as a temporary makeshift if we had no script of our own. But to adopt the Roman script for Hindustani which has got two acknowledged scripts
 
 is only a sign of the psychological conquest that the English have made over us. In order to conquer the English who had conquered you, you adopted the English garb, i. e., Roman script, for your bulletins in South East Asia. You should have discarded this symbol of the cultural conquest and insisted on having your bulletin in the two Indian scripts rather than in Roman. The latter was primarilly adopted for the sake of the British officers and men who had to learn Hindustani in order to rule over us. They solved the  difficulty presented by the permutations and combinations of the Urdu alphabet and tempted us by their typerwriters, telegraph and printing machines which use Roman script. We succumbed. We may not hark back to the symbol of our cultural conques when we are out to end India’s slavery in toto. When you served in the British army it was with the prospect of getting rewards in the form of decorations, comfortable pay and pensions, grants of land, etc. But now you don’t want such temptations. You serve only for the independence and honour of your country. You do not want the easy way.
 India will soon have independence. Do not think that there will be one script for Hindustani all at once. It will come when you and I have honestly and diligently learnt both the scripts—not before. That is the least price we have to pay for independence.
 In support of his argument he cited the parallel of South Africa where they have everything in two languages. The Government gazette is published in two languages and so are the textbooks for use in schools.
And it is not called partition, but Union of South Africa. To
 maintain this union they have four capitals one for each province. That is the way of a free and freedom-living people.
 Shri Ayer agreed and said, “We shall have the Hindustani bulletin in Nagari and Urdu scripts, not in Roman.

   GOSHALAS AND PINJRAPOLES  
 The following condensation from a scheme propounded by Sardar Sir Datar Singhlibtech_685_footnotewill be of general interest:
 It is estimated that there are at present 3,000 goshalas in the country with a population of over six lakh head of cattle. These organizations, besides taking up the improvement of their institutions as envisaged by the Government of India, in the
 
 present threatened famine conditions can come to the country’s help by production of more milk in the  institutions.  The  number of well-organized gashalas and pinjrapoles can  be taken as half, i. e., 1,500. The cattle may be classified as:
 Good 	dairy type 20%	1,20,000 Fair 	type—good for 	breeding, though not 
highly productive 20%	1,20,000
  Old, 	infirm  and 	unfit for 	further breeding 60%	3,60,000 It is the first and second class that could be exploited for 
 milk production and breeding.  Out of these	2,40,000 half will be milch and half dry.
 Better feeding, management, organization, etc.,  would mean an increase in production of 1,20,000 seers or, say, 3,000 maunds of milk per day.
 In order to achieve this end immediately, a skeleton plan is suggested below:
   Productive 		animals should be 		separated  from 		 those that 		are aged, 		infirm or otherwise 		useless. The latter 		should be removed 		to rural 		areas, preferably to 		forest rakhs 		libtech_686_footnotein 		order to 		relieve congestion and 		allow better feeding of 		productive. Their 		care, as 		well as 		that of 		dry stock 		farms, may be 		in the hands 		of a committee.  For 		the achievement of 		this end, the 		stock should be 		divided in 		the following manner:  
 Milch 	animals about to calve 	should be kept 	at the 
 goshala premises.
  Dry 	animals fit 	for breeding should be 	kept on 	the lands, 	if any, 	belonging to the goshala 	in the 	neighbourhood or 	may provided 	for at 	a place 	from where 	they could 	be returned 	when about 	to calve, and 	the animals which go 	dry in  the goshala, 	should be 	sent there. 
   The 		congestion relieved, goshalas and 		pinjrapoles will 		have enough space to 		house cattle 		properly, feed them 		scientifically and 		carry out 		other improvements.  To 		further help, 		encourage and 		stimulate these 		institutions in this direction, it is suggested 		to help 		them financially 		by giving 		them 50% reduction 		on concentrates 		and fodder on the condition that these institution will increase their  
 
 
 milk production immediately either by keeping milch cattle of the owners who not able to keep them during the famine days or bybuying cattle where their finances permit. The Government will have the option of purchasing one-third of their milk supply for the needy people of the locality and in the neighbourhood, if required.
   Attempts 		should be made 		to feed 		cattle more on feeds 		which are not generally 		required for direct 		human consumption such 		as oil-cakes, cotton seeds, etc.  It 		may also be 		stated here 		that by feeding 		by-products of 		grains to 		the cattle, 		not only 		can the production 		of available 		food be 		increased the 		form of 		additional milk from these animals 		as compared 		to the 		food value of 		these by-products 		of food 		in case 		they are directly 		consumed, but it 		will also be 		more economical 		method of using the latter. Within limits, it will have double 		effect. It will 		help in the 		production of 		human food 		and will 		also protect the 		cattle from being 		underfed during 		the scarcity period.  All 		possible facilities 		should be provided 		for transport and 		supply of concentrates 		and other cattle-feeds 		to these institutions. 		Collection of data 		as to the requirements 		of the goshalas 		and the available 		stocks in these 		organizations should 		immediatey be 		taken in 		hand. Provision should 		be made 		well in advance 		for the 		supply of 		these essential 		requirements from 		surplus to 		deficit zones. All 		this must be done  in 		 advance through 		Goshala Development Officers, who 		will be 		responsible for 		the working of 		the whole scheme.  
 The Sardar suggests to every province the appointment of Goshala Development Officers, training of workers and the supply of bulls. He rightly says that for real success there must be genuine co- operation between Government and the public. He has no doubt that goshalas, humanitarian and cattle welfare and such other bodies will give the co-operation if approached.
 Another friend of cattle writes as follows: libtech_687_footnote
 I want you to consider one or two suggestions for saving our cattle during the coming famine. . . .
 My concrete suggestion is that well-to-do people.. . should be generous enough to permit cattle belonging to less fortunate people to graze
 
 in their compounds.
 Provincial government should establish a chain of goshalas where owners of cattle, who are unable to maintain them during the period of famine, may leave them to be fed and maintained at State expense unitl the crisis is over.

  NOTESlibtech_689_footnote 
 ‘SILK KHADI’
 If particle payment in yarn is necessary for buying cotton khadi why shoud the same not apply to ‘silk khadi’?
There can be only one answer to this question. Silk khadi too
 is khadi and its purchase should, therefore, also be contingent on the requisite payment of yarn.
 WHY  ONLY YARN?
 Since spinning is a part of the constructive programme, why should not all constructive workers be exempt from paying for khadi in yarn?
There   is   some   confusion   of   thought   in   this question.The
 reason for part payment in yarn, instead of in money, is to give khadi its rightful place, and in time make yarn current coin. That yarn is a part of the constructive work has no bearing on the present argument. Let us leave aside for the moment the fact that the wheel is the central
 
 
 sun of the solar system of our constructive programme. If we believe that swaraj hangs by the hand-spun thread, then it is clear that the value of yarn will be far greater than glad and silver currency. Constructive workers are not exempt from spinning. How can there be any such exemption from yajna? Spinning is the necessary yajna for everyone.

  WHY  NOT?libtech_690_footnote 
 You say that if Kasturba Agents are also  members  of  the  legis- latures, it will be setting a bad example to the villagerslibtech_691_footnote. I can under-  stand  this  being  applicable  to  the   present   Assembly,   but   when   we  have   swaraj   the   position  will be  changed.libtech_692_footnoteWill  it,  therefore,  not  be an advantage for us to be there? Will not such work as we want done be done in one session of the  legislature,  whereas  ordinarily  it  would  take years to do?
So writes a sister. But there seem to be three flaws in her line of
argument.
 Firstly, I have not made any distinction between the present and the future Assembly under swaraj. It is unnecessary for my argument.
 Secondly, it is an illusion to think that M. L. A.s are the guides of the voters. Voters do not send representatives to the Assemblies in order to be guided by them. On the contrary, they are sent there loyally to carry out the people’s wishes. The people are, therefore, the guides, not the M. L. A.s. The latter are servants, the former masters. The illusion is due to the present system of government. When the illusion disappears, the existing unseemly comptition to get into the legislature will also be much less. There will be a few whose duty it will be to go there, and they will go to do the people’s will. Today they go to the Assembly in order to fight there for swaraj, but  it has now dawned on most people that they cannot achieve much there even in this line.
 The third mistake in the argument is that Assemblies are best fitted to guide the people. If we look around the world we shall find
 
 that the best guidance is given by those outside. If that were not so, a rot would set in all governments, because the field for guidance is vast and the Assembly is a very small thing. Parliaments are, after all, a mere drop in the ocean of national life.

 RAJA SAHEB,
 Your letter is good but it is next to impossible for me to go anywhere for the present. Once the work here is finished I shall have to go directly to Poona. I am not in a condition any more to break journey anywhere on the way. The best course for you would be to read and ponder what I have written and then put into effect as much of it as you can digest in your own life and in the affairs of your state. The moment Ramarajya has been established in  Awagarh,  I  am certain it will attract me like a magnet. You should also have that faith.
 Yours sincerely,

 MAULANA SAHEB,
 Read the enclosed clippings. Whatever is written about me is without foundation. I have not expressed my opinion to anybody. When one or two members of the Committee asked me about it I told them that it is not proper to have the same president. In fact I feel unhappy that a Muslim should remain president at this juncture. If you agree with this view I would like you to read the enclosed clippings. You should issue a statement announcing that you do not wish to remain the president. It would be appropriate if some other person becomes the president. Badshah Khan’s name had already been proposed but I strongly opposed it. I even had a discussion with Badshah Khan.
 If my opinion were sought this time, I would prefer Jawaharlal.
There are several reasons for it. I do not want to go into them.
 Yours,

  SPEECH  AT  KASTURBA 	 BALIKA  ASHRAMlibtech_699_footnote 
 April 20, 1946
 I attach far more importanc to the cultural aspect of education than to  the  literarylibtech_700_footnote.  Culture  is  the  foundation,  the  primary  thing which the girls ought to get from here. It should show in the smallest detail of your conduct and personal behaviour, how you sit, how you walk, how you dress, etc., so that anybody might be able to see at a glance that you are the products of this institution. Inner culture must be reflected in your speech, the way in which you treat visitor and guests, and behave towards one another and your teachers and elders.
 I was pleased too that you walked all the distance to and from Bhangi Nivas, when you came to see me. But if you came only to please me, your trudging had no merit. It will do you no good. You must make it a rule to prefer walking to using a conveyance. Motor- car is not for the millions. You will therefore shun it. Million cannot afford even train journey. Their world is their village. It is a very small thing but if you faithfully adhere to this rule it will transform your entire life and fill it with a sweetness that natural simplicity carries with it.
 Education here won’t  qualify  you  for  luxurious  living.  I want  the  Harijan  girls  here to  show  such a  degree   of   culture that everybody should feel ashamed to regard  them as  untouch- ables. That is the  goal  of  the  Harijan  Sevak  Sangh’s activities.  This institution should demonstrate to the whole world the heights to which Harijans can rise, if they are free from the incubus of untouch- ability and conversely the sacrilege and inhumanity of the institution of untouchability itself. I look forward to the day when this institution will fill the whole country with its fragrance and become a centre of attraction for girls from near and far.

 I have proved my claim to being a member of the family by coming without previous notice,
 Gandhiji remarked, touched by the spontaneous welcome. He then invited questions.
 One student asked, “What can the students do to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity?”
 The way is simple. Even if all the Hindus turn rowdies and abuse you, you may not cease to regard them as your blood-brothers and vice versa. Is it imposible? No, rather the contrary. And what is possible for the individual is possible for the mass.
 Today the whole atmosphere is poisoned. All kinds of wild. rumours are circulated by the press and are indiscriminately swal- lowed by the people. Panic results and both Hindus and Muslmans forget their humanity and behave towards one another  like  wild brutes. It behoves men to act decently, irrespective of what the other party might or might not do. If one returns decency for decency, it is  a bargain. Even thieves and dacoits do that. There is no merit in it. Humanity disdains to calculate profits and losses. It enjoins on one a unilateral obligation to put up decent behaviour. If all the Hindus listened to my advice, or in the alternative the Muslims listened to me, there would be peace in India which neither daggers nor lathis would be able to shatter. The mischief-maker will soon be weary of the sorry business of stabbing, when there is no retaliation or counter- pro-vocation. An Unseen Power will arrest his uplifted arm and it will refuse to obey his wicked will. You may throw dust at the sun, it won’t dim his lustre. All it needs is to hold one’s soul in faith and patience. God is good and does not allow wickness to proced beyond a certain length.
I had a hand in the bulding up of this institution.libtech_703_footnotelibtech_704_footnoteIt, therefore,

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 April 20, 1946
 Addressing the gathering after the prayers on Saturday evening Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the fact that Ramanama recited from the heart was the never- failing remedy for all the ills—physical, mental of spiritual. He watched them taking part in the Ramdhun but whether they did it from the heart God alone knew. They themselves might know. But self-deception was quite possible. It was so very easy. One thing was clear. If a man or a woman who claimed to recite Ramanama from the heart was always ailing or was given to outbursts of anger the claim was eventually unproved.
 Tolstoy had said that if man dismissed God from his heart even for a single moment Satan occupied the vacancy. Ramanama would expel Satan. Honest men and women had said to him that with all their efforts they could not say tha Ramanama came to them from the heart. His reply to them was that they must go on and have infinite patience. A boy required at least 16 years’ hard study in order to become a doctor. How mcuh more time must be necessary to establish Ramanama in the heart?
 While he was endeavouring to enthrone God in the heart and believed in nature’s way he would confine to the five elements as curative means. He would give first place to pure air. It was the prime necessity. That implied that their houses and social surroundings should be perfectly clean. They must not live in air-tight boxes miscalled houses. They should live as free practically as they were on the prayer ground.

  DEPLORABLE 
 Shri J. C. Kumarappa, writing in the Gram Udyog Patrika, says that to rely on or encourage imports from abroad is wholly wrong in principle. In the matter of the expected shortage of sugar owing to the failure of winter rains in the U. P. and Bihar and by frost in the Punjab and N. W. F. P., he suggests that the deficit in sugar should be made  good  by   tapping    palm  trees  in  jungle  areas  for  niralibtech_705_footnoteand
 
 
 preparing gurlibtech_706_footnotelibtech_707_footnoteand sugar from it.
 In regard to the import of a primary necessity like kerasne oil, he suggests further extraction of vegetable oils to meet our needs. Imports will entail export of some of our own production to pay for them, and will only cause further distress in the long run.
 He also draws attention to the insidious scheme for the development of Virginia cigarette tobacco in Bihar sponsored by Sir Herbert Stewart (Vice-Chairman of the Imperial Council of Agricul- tural Research). Under the scheme a nember of research stations on tobacco are to be opened in various places and the places and the Imperial Tobacco Company have given two studentships of £500 per annum for training in tobacco cultivation abroad. At such a time the obvious duty of a government should have been not to waste good money or time on tobacco research, but to devote both to reclaim all available land for food cultivation. But Imperial Councial can only think in terms of either tobacco, long staple cotton or thick rind sugar-cane for mills and ground-nut for export, and  thus  serve  foreign business masquerading as “India, Ltd.”.

  	“HARIJAN” IN URDU SCRIPT 
 Harijan is variously described as ‘Harijan Sevak’ when it is the Hindustani and Harijanbandhu when it is the Gujarati edition. Hindustani was Hindi when it was Nagari type only. Now, for reasons already known, it is Hindustani in the two scripts—Nagari and Urdu. The Urdu edition would have been published simultaneously, if the arrangement could have been completed. But there were difficulties of official permission and type to be surmounted. Litho printing became well-nigh impossible, and expert advice favoured Urdu type. The type could not be had for the wanting. But it is now hoped definitely to bring out the Urdu edition on 5th May next.
 Whilst the matter in the three editions is not as a rule mere translation, one of another, and to an extent differs in the three editions, the Nagari and Urdu will be the same, word for word. An endeavour will be made to produce Hindustani which will neither be Sanskritized Hindi nor Persianized Urdu. Whether the Hindustani will be popular or not will depend as much upon the writers for the Hindustani Harijan as upon its readers.

  IS IT GENUINE? 
 Q. In one of your post-prayer discourese last week you stressed the use of khadi to the exclusion of all other cloth.libtech_708_footnoteI love the very touch of khadi as it links me, in my heart and thoughts, to my poor sisters and brothers, to whom it brings a well-earned morsel of food. I love it from every point of view—on hygienic, aesthetic, humanitarian, moral and spiritual grounds. But I have so far never been able to take to spinning, much as I like the soothing hum of the wheel, and thanks to our system of education, my hands are utterly untrained and unfit to learn spinning at this stage. I am, therefore, unable to comply in a straightforward manner with the
 condition now imposed on the sale of khadi, and it is galling to me to have to go in for mill cloth.
 A. If the love for khadi is so genuine as to cover moral and spiritual values, surely the writer should be able to learn spinning easily at his age. The late Pandit Motilal Nehru learnt it, after he was
 
 fifty. The late Ali Brothers learnt it, though they did not practise it regularly. And all these three learnt it for its national and political value in the highest sense of the term. As a matter of fact most of the public workers learnet it late in life.
 The writer should learn spinning without delay. There is nothing wrong with his fingers. All who can write can spin. And spinning for swaraj is any day more valuable than writing.
 I agree that for one like the writer the only straight forward way to give his quota of yarn for buying khadi is self-spinning. If he was incapable for any cause, it would be perfectly right for him to get his many friends or relations to spin the required quota for him.
 As an earnest student of affairs, he shold know, too, that while khadi is good for the poor as an honourable occupation for earning bread, it has an additional and far greater value as an instrument of winning swaraj through non-violent means. Let it not be said of men like him that they could write eloquently about moral values without realizing the implications of the statement.

  MERCY v. 	 RUTHLESSNESSlibtech_709_footnote 
 The virtues of mercy, non-violence, love and truth in any man can be truly tested only when they are pitted against ruthlessness, violence, hate and untruth.
 If this  is  true,  then  it  is  incorrect  to  say  that  ahimsa  is  of  no avail before a murderer. It can certainly be said that to expe- riment with ahimsa in the face of a murderer is to seek self-destruc- tion. But this is the real test of ahimsa. He who gets himself killed out of sheer helplessness, however, can in nowise be said to have passed the test. He who when being killed bears no anger against  his  murderer and even ask God to forgive him is trulymnon-violent. History relates this of Jesus Christ. With his dying breath on the cross, he is reported to have said: “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” We can get similar instances from other religions but the quotation is given because it is world-famous.
 It is another matter that our non-violence has not reached such heights. It would be wholly wrong for us to lower the standard of
 
 ahimsa by reason of our own frailty or lack of experience. Without true understanding of the ideal, we can never hope to reach it. It is necessary for us, therefore, to apply our reason to understand the power of non-violence.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 April 21, 1946
 Gandhiji had noticed that several men and women did  not  take  part  in  beating time with Ramdhun. He pulled them up in his after-prayer discourses on Sunday. There was nothing to be ashamed of in repeating the name of God and in beating time with it.  Modesty was an admirable virtue, but out of place it became   a fault.
 Reverting to the subject of the previous evening, i. e., nature cure, Gandhiji spoke about pure water, the second in importance among the five natural elements, the first one being air about which he had spoken on Saturdaylibtech_713_footnote. Large numbers of men and women in this country drank impure water and washed their clothes with and bathed in water which made the body and the clothes dirtier than before.
 
 
 Will any of you care to bathe or  wash  your  clothes  in  the gutter water? Yet many of the small tanks where people bathe and wash and even drink from are no cleaner than the gutter. Nature is lenient. If often does not punish us for our sins immediately. Thus we can go on breathing impure air and drinking impure water over long periods without any dramatic ill effects. But there is not the slightest doubt that such a thing lowers the vitality and makes one fall an easy prey to disease.
 Gandhiji  told the audience what he had seen on the banks of the sacred Ganges  at Hardwar. People went there to wast off their sins, but they made the place so dirty that it could not even wash their bodies clean. He used to find it difficult to bathe at Har-ki-Pauri if he was at all late.  People evacuated on the banks and did not even care   to cover it up with sand. They made the bathing-ghat filthy, strewing flowers were trampled under the feet and so on. It was a painful state of affairs, a thing of which Indains had real cause to be ashamed.
 He  had  taken  up  the  new  job  of  advising  people  on  nature  cure.   A doctor had to go through  five  years  of  hard  studies  before   he   could  begin  to treat  patients.  Not  so  the   nature-cure   man.   Speaking   about   himself   he   said he had picked  up  the  essentials  of  nature  cure  by  reading  a  few  books  and talking to  experts  in   the   line.   Experience   and  experimentation  had  made  up the  rest.  They  could  all  do  the  same  and  became  their   own   doctors.   People  had  a  notion  that what  was  simple  was  no  good.  A  spinning-wheel  was   simple. It was, therefore, condemned as primitive and crude. A mill cost a lot and  was elaborate. It was an indication of progress. If this was their view, he was afraid they would have no use for him as he was but a simple-minded villager and a believer in the philosophy of simplicity. But he knew that most of them were simple-minded men and women like him and though they lived in a city, they had not lost all contact with the villages. Therefore, he felt emboldened to place nature cure before them.
 Pure air and pure water were the first essentials, and of course Ramanama was there all the time. A man who repeated Ramanama and thereby cleansed his inner being could not tolerate the filth outside. If millions took to Ramanama in real earnest there would be no riots, which were a social malady, and there would be no illnesses. The Kingdom of Heaven would come on earth.

  MINISTERS’ DUTY 
 It is legitimate to ask what Congress ministers will do for  khaddar and other village industries now that they are in office. I should broaden the question and apply it to all the Provincial Government of India. Poverty is common to all the provinces and so are means of alleviation in terms of the masses. Such is the experience of both the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A. A suggestion has been made that there should be a separate minister for the work, as, for proper organization, it will occupy all the time of one minister.I dread to make the suggestion, for we have not yet outlived the English scale of expenditure. Whether a minister is separately appointed or not, a department for the work is surely necessary. In these times of scarcity of food and clothing, this department can render the greatest help. The ministers have experts at their disposal through the A. I. S. A. and the A. I. V. I. A. It is possible to clothe today the whole of India  in khadi on the smallest outlay and in the shortest time possible. Each Provincial Government has to tell the villagers that they must manu- facture their own khaddar for their own use. This there will undoub- tedly be a surplus for the cities at least to a certain extent which, in its turn, will reduce the pressure on the local mills. The latter will then be able to take part in supplying the want of cloth in other parts of the world. How can this result be brought about?
 The Governments should notify the villagers that they will be expected to manufacture khaddar for the needs of their villages within a fixed date after which no cloth will be supplied to them.The Govern- ments in their turn will supply the villagers with cotton seed or cotton wherever required, at cost price and the tools of manufacture also at cost, to be recovered in easy instalments payable in, say five years or more. They will supply them with instructors wherever necessary and undertake to buy surplus stock of khaddar, provided that the villagers in question have their cloth requirement supplied from their own manufacture. This should do away with cloth shortage without fuss and with very little overhead charges.
 The villages will be surveyed and a list prepared of things that can be manufactured locally with little or no help and which may be required for village use or for sale outside, such for instance, as ghanilibtech_714_footnotepressed oil and cakes, burning oil prepared through ghanis, hand-
 
 
 pounded rice,  tad gudlibtech_715_footnotelibtech_716_footnote,  honey, toys, mats, hand-made paper, village soap, etc. If enough care is thus taken, the villages, most of them as good as dead or dying, will hum with life and exhibit the immense possibilities they have of supplying most of their wants themselves and of the cities and towns of India.
 Then there is the limitless cattle wealth of India suffering from criminal neglect. Goseva Sangh, as yet not properly experienced, can still supply valuable aid.
 Without the basic training the villagers are being starved for education. This desideretum can be supplied by the Hindustani Tamil Sangh. The experiment was already commenced by Congress Govern- ments but it was interrupted by the resignations of the Congress ministries.libtech_717_footnoteThe thread can be  easily resumed now.

  QUESTION  BOXlibtech_718_footnote 
 SUGAR AND SWEETMEATS
 Q.    The suggar ration in Bombay has just been reduced by 25 per cent.   Would  it not have been fairer to reduce sweetmeat shops’ rations rather than cut down the individual’s?
 A. It is always well to cut down the ration of sweet vendors rather than that of individuals. In these hard times I would not mind if sweet-making were even prohibited. Sweetmeats are not a necessary part of a wholesome diet.
 WHITE BREAD AND BROWN
 Q. Up till January it was obligatory to mix ten per cent of bran with wheat flour. Later the rule was obolished. Should it not be reinforced?
A.   I  am a   witness  to  the  age-old  rivalry  between  white  and
 whole-meal brown bread. People are attracted by whiteness. I nurse the belief that Negro is not drawn by it. Be that as it may, it is a fact that special effort is made to make bread look white. Fortunately, only city-dwellers indulge in such fads. Doctors say that one chapati  of whole-meal flour is more tasty and contains more nourishment than two to  five  chapatis made out of refined  flour.  And in these days   it
 
 is our duty to use whole-meal, because all flour saved is flour gained. From one point of view it is even more than that. Wheat stored in villages is far more useful than sacks of it lying in ports. Therefore, it is desirable to make the mixing of bran with wheat flour compu- lsory. The war is over but post-war conditions are worse for us than during the war, and the situation is daily deteriorating. God alone knows when it will improve.
 ROWDYISM IN ELECTIONS
 Q. You are no doubt aware of the rowdyism resulting in severe damage during one of the recent elections in Bombay.  Does it become the teacher of ahimsa  to keep silent on such an occasion?
 I do not want to enter into the question of whether silence 
 becomes me or not. If the rowdyism is not a forerunner of what the future holds, it will be wrong to take note of it. Such sporadic clashes should not worry us. The education of the masses in ahimsa can make way gradually. It may be that it will develop from the lessons learnt from such happenings. But it may be that this rowdyism is symptomatic of an epidemic. Many people imagine that they alone are right and everyone else wrong, and they do not consider that there is anything unworthy in forcing their point of view down others’ throats. This error has to be rectified. If we are in the right we must have infinite patience.
 Just now we seem unable to see our own mistakes. Those who lack the faculty of reason, or who desire to live for the sake of enjoy- ment, can never see the error. If there are many such, then we must conclude that our non-violence has been a weapon of the weak, himsa masquerading in the guise of ahimsa. If this weakness conti-nue we shall have to go through rivers of blood once the British rule goes. We may even come under the sway of some other foreign power or it may be that with internecine warfare the weaker side will have to submit to the one that has the mightier weapons. If we are unfortunate enough to witness such streif, believers in non-violence will joyfully die in the effort to stop it and thereby live.
 My hope is that the masses have sufficiently imbibed the spirit of ahimsa and that when the British go there may be a little fight here and there and then we shall settle down as brothers giving a lesson of peace to the world.
 Only those who fought in Bombay know what good they achieved by fighting. I am ignorant of who fought and what the fight was about and what were the gains if any.

 the person who has become the symbol of your goal. But the diffi- culty is that the person himself has become your goal. That happens to many and they suffer in consequence. When we make the person symbolizing our goal himself our goal, the result is that we feel happy when his actions and words are such as please us, but get offended when they are otherwise. One should, therefore, keep one’s goal independent. Until you can do that, you will suffer, and so will your work. You have been educated, but learnt no wisdom!!! Learn it now. Learn it from me if you don’t have it. In doing this there will be no conflict at all between your goal and the syambol of your goal, for learning wisdom means acquiring knowledge of practical affairs. But remember that practical affairs may be conducted either truthfully or untruthfully. Wake up.

 We realize that we shall secure our salvation at the hands of Indian leaders, not the British Government.
 Everybody believes that today. Even the British Government feel that they cannot do otherwise than to leave India to settle her own affairs.
 The landholders derived their charter of rights and privileges from the Permanent Settlement which was of the nature of a contract between the British and the zamindars, but they are quite willing to negotiate an agreement with the leaders of the country on the future of their rights.
 Being a non-violent man by nature I cannot countenance the usurpation of anybody’s just rights. But some of the extraordinary privileg that pass muster under the British rule are themselves in the nature of an usurpation. The history of British rule is a history of usurpation. Those who helped the British Government in this process got certain rights as a reward for their services. These cannot be insisted upon.
 Many ancient zamindaris libtech_727_footnoteexisted long before the advent of the British and were exercising sovereign power, as a produce of indigenous social and economic system of long standing. Don’t you think they have a title to continue their existence? They are trying their best to discharge a philanthropic function in the shape of founding educational and social institutions.
 Anything that is ancient and consistent with moral values has a title to be retained. Per contra anything that does not conform to more values has to go. Wrong has no prescriptive right to exist merely because it is of long standing. If those who are on your zamindaris feel one with you and you with them, like members of a family, you have nothing to fear from anybody.
 We want even-handed justice. We have no objection to an indepedent Indian Government abolishing all manner of vested interests. But let there be no discrimin- ation against the zamindars especially. We only want a conciliatory gest-ure, an assurance that you won’t wipe us out as a class, without giving us a sporting chance to vindicate our existence.
 A just man need have no fear of any kind from an independent. India may, however, fall into unjust hands. Every Congressman is not an angel, nor is everyone who is not a Congressman a devil. Let us hope that, if Congress comes into power, it will try to be more than just. Otherwise all the good that it might have done would disappear in the twinkling of an eye.
 I do not deny that there are bad boys amongst us. But you can cure us. We
 
 only wish that nothing should be done without consulting us.
That goes without saying.libtech_728_footnote

  TALK WITH MISSIONARIES 
 [Before April 23, 1946] Another group of friends presented Gandhiji with a poser: “Could  he guaranteed that under independence the right of proselytization would be guaranteed
 by a statue?” This provoked the counter question, “Did they really believe in the ideal
 of independence or was their support to the independence ideal only for a consideration?” In the latter case, he would say, remarked Gandhiji, that they believed neither in independence nor in religion. Who could suppress the voice of truth if it filled one’s being? And of what avail was a statutory gurantee if there was not the fire within to bear witness to truth?
 “It is true, no one can suppress the voice of truth,” interpolated one of them. “We want a guarantee from you that no attempt would be made to suppress it.”
I cannot give you that guarantee because I have no authority.
 It was the function of religion, he continued, to save the temporal power from losing its soul; religion did not depend upon it for protection. And he cited to them the illustraction of Daniel, the servant of God, who used to pray behind closed doors. But when Darius the King issued a decree prohibiting the worship of any God or man save himself under a penalty, he began to pray to God publicly, the windows of his chamber being open so that all could see him praying. He was thrown into the hungry lion’s den but came out unscathed. The result was that the King rescinded his former decree which was ‘unalterable’ under the laws of Medes and Persians and made another decree to the effect that in every dominion of his kingdom, “men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God and steadfast as ever.” And “so Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus.” That was the only true way of proselytization and it needed no guarantee, statutory or otherwise. It was  its own seal and sanction.
 To take a leaf from the history of our own times, remember the words of the late Lord Salisbury who, when in office, had told a missionary deputation about [sic] China that they were a poor specimen if for their mission they sought the protection of British guns.

  From 	a copy of the Gujarati : Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy : Pyarelal     SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING   April 23, 1946 Speaking 	after the prayers, 	Gandhiji thanked 	the Maulvi Saheb for the recitation.libtech_738_footnoteThe 	selectionslibtech_739_footnotewere not 	all made by 	him.  For 	instance,  the   Koranic  prayer 	had been introduced by Raihanabehn Tyabjilibtech_740_footnote.   She came 	    and recited 	it  herself  in 	the beginning 	and then taught 	it to others. 	The prayer 	from Zend 	Avesta was 	introduced by 	Dr. Gilderlibtech_741_footnote. May 	be there 	were mistakes in 	the recitation. 	But God 	cared for 	what was 	in men’s hearts rather 	than what was produced 	from their mouths. It would 	be best 	if a 	Muslim recited the 	Koranic prayer and 	a Parsi 	recited the Parsi 	prayer and so 	on. But in 	the absence 	of such 	an arrangement 	one did the best 	one could.        
 Next he drew the attention of the people to the need for discipline. Shri Kanu Gandhi had made it his profession to teach people Ramdhun and through it discipline in every walk of life. They should all sit in regular rows instead of in a disorderly and haphazard fashion.
 He had come to know that Harijan collections at the prayer meetings were very meagre nowadays. That was bad. They should all contribute their bit according to their capacity.
 Finally, he reverted to the question of nature cure. He had talked to them about  air and water. libtech_742_footnoteToday he wanted to talk about earth, the earth which the human body is made of and to which it must return.
Whether the dead are buried or cremated, dust returns to dust.
Like air and water, earth is God’s creation and we must not soil it.
 People were in the habit of spitting anywhere, throwing orange skins and bits of paper here and there.  All that was sin.  To put anything out of place was equivalent   to soiling the earth. A man of prayer could never do that.
Death might claim us at any moment. Let us then be on the
 alert and recite Ramanama all the time. We must cleanse if we can, never soil, His creation.

If you tie bamboo poles together, they make a sort of bridge. Without a support for the feet made of boards or bamboo poles, you may be sure that the pits will be useless.

 BHAI BHAGWADACHARYA,
 I have your letter after many days. I must admit that I don’t like it. Firstly, why should you involve yourself in the ritual sacrifice which is more or less a fraud? I can understand those who  are  ignorant of the true nature of dharma or are downright hypocrites busying themselves with it, but why a man like you should concern himself with it is something beyond my comprehension, especially because I don’t want to look upon you as a hypocrite and because I am not prepared to believe that you are so sunk in abysmal ignorance. And if there was a sacrifice, wherefore all the discrimination? Those who do not want to come may not; those who want may come. Hence, in no way can my heart accept either your act or your justification of it. I would wish you to devote yourself single-heartedly to what is straightforward and truthful, rather than indulge in mere casuistry.
 I am strongly opposed to sacrifice as it is currently interpret- ed. I consider it a sin to throw ghee into the sacrificial [fire] in our age. Sacrifice really means an act of service. I had thefefore hoped that you would follow only that which is truthful even by giving up your position as a swami.

  SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_754_footnote 
 April 24, 1946
 Speaking after the prayers on Wednesday evening Gandhiji reverted to the place of earth, which in nature cure was only next to air and water. One of the curative uses of earth was an earth-bath. Dry, finely powdered earth rubbed on the body cleansed the skin. Mud applied to the body and allowed to dry could cure many skin diseases. More than 40 years ago a little nephew of his had boils all over the body. They were slow to respond to any treatment. Finally he took the case in his hands, covered the boy’s body with mud and made him run about naked. The boy was cured in eight to ten days.
 Gandhiji said that earth was full of miraculous properties and it was as useful in man’s life as any other thing could be.
We are born of earth and return to earth after life’s journey.  In
the morning prayers there is a  shloka in which the devotee invokes
 
 mother earth and asks her forgiveness for treading upon her. If we expect our prayer to be heard, we must show our reverence in  practice. We must not soil the earth or dirty it as many of us do today. If somebody soils the earth through ignorance or oversight by spitting or in any other manner, we should cover up the filth with dry earth.

  THE MONKEY  NUISANCElibtech_755_footnote 
 People get weary of the trouble caused to them by monkeys. In their hearts they wish them dead. They  are  inwardly  pleased  if anyone kills them. At the same time they will oppose their slaughter. A friend who is well acquainted with the scriptures  writes  that monkeys ruin the crops, they even kidnap children, carry away  articles, and eat up fruit, etc. Their number is daily increasing. I am asked as to what non-violence dictates in the matter.
 My ahimsa is my own. I am not able to accept in its entirety the doctrine of non-killing of animals. I have no feeling in me to save the lives of animals which devour or cause hurt to man. I consider it wrong to help in the increase of their progeny. Therefore, I will not feed ants, monkeys or dogs. I will never sacrifice a man’s life in order to save theirs.
 Thinking along these lines I have come to the conclusion that to do away with monkeys where they have become a menace to the well- being of man is pardonable. Such killing becomes a duty. The question may arise as to why this rule should not also apply to human beings. It cannot because, however bad, they are as we are. Unlike the animal, man has been given the faculty of reason.

  DRAFT AND NOTE ON PROPOSED PROCLAMATION ON  SALTlibtech_756_footnote  THE PROCLAMATION  
 In order that the poorest in the land may feel that independence is coming and as an earnest of their bona fides, the Government of India declare that the Salt Tax is abolished from today. To that end the inspectors of . . .libtech_757_footnotelibtech_758_footnoteshall withdraw from their scenes of activity and the villagers will be notified by beat of drum and otherwise that they are at liberty to manufacture salt wherever they can for themselves or for sale. Other instructions about the State manufacture and sale of salt will be issued in due course.
  NOTE 		ON THE 		PROPOSED PROCLAMATION 		ON SALT  
 When the Salt Tax is abolished the monopoly goes likewise. Individuals should be free to manufacture salt for consumption or sale. Therefore, while there would be no monopoly in law, the Government will by their better organizing power and scientific skill be able to create a virtual monopoly. They will not allow private corporations to make manufacture and sale of salt a source of profiteering. It will be a legitimate paying business in the hands of the State. Consumption of the article is so universal that the profit of even a pie on every seer would bring in a natural income to the State. Every dealer in salt will be required to take out a licence for selling salt in his shop. [A] dealer is not to be confused with a hawker. A hawker who carried salt on his person will be free to sell without a licence. This will free the individual manufacturer and seller from interference.
 Government will add to the revenue also by putting a heavy, though not a prohibitive, customs duty on foreign salt, whether British or otherwise.
 Whilst anxiety has been shown in this note to show how salt may be made to yield legitimate revenue to the State, equal if not greater
 
 care has been taken no make salt free like air and water for the individual who wants to labour for its manufacture and sale.

  SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING 
 April 25, 1946
 Speaking after the prayers, Gandhiji introduced Badshah Khan as a fakir and a man of God. He had come to Delhi in connection with the meeting of the Working Committee of which he was a member. But he was essentially a man of God. His company was satsang, hallowed company for them as it was for him.
 Gandhiji told the audience of a letter he had received from a correspondent criticizing Mr. Kanu Gandhi and the way he led Ramdhun. Ramdhun should be in the heart; where was the need for all the external show, the correspondent had asked. There was no doubt, observed Gandhiji, that Ramanama should come from the heart. But the external things were an indication of what was within. Supposing everyone struck a different note while reciting prayers in the mosque or during the chanting of hymns in the church, it would utterly ruin the solemnity of the service. There was a right way of doing everything and prayers were no exception.
 A gentleman, Gandhiji proceeded, had sent him a book describing how namazlibtech_761_footnoteshould be offered. While turning over the pages of that book he came across a sentence in it which was to the effect that prayer said in  congregation  was  27 times as effective as prayer said by oneself. If they all joined in the prayer whole-heartedly and methodically it would gather momentum in  geometric progression and so transform the atmosphere that riots in Delhi would become an impossibility.

  STATEMENT TO THE PRESS 
 NEW DELHI,
 April 26, 1946
 Mr.  Hoover’slibtech_762_footnotelibtech_763_footnoteflying  visit  to  India  has  excited   considerable interest and possibly hope. Whilst all the  help  that  America  and other countries  can  send  to  India,  struggling against  starvation, must be welcome, my endeavour has been to find ways and means to make ourselves self-supporting. the moment people give way to panic, starvation is a certainty in spite of a continuous line of steamers off-loading grain from outside on India’s wharves. Conversely, every grain from abroad sent as a matter of duty to self-reliant  India, honestly and manfully braving the threatening danger, will be twice blessed. Let Mr. Hoover’s visit serve as a reminder to Government servants, monied men and grain merchants that they must think all the time of their duty to the masses. Nature never fails those who will help themselves.

  NON-VIOLENT  VOLUNTEER  CORPSlibtech_764_footnote 
 Some time ago an attempt was made, at my instance, to form shanti dalslibtech_765_footnotelibtech_766_footnotebut nothing came of it.  This lesson, however, was learnt, that the membership, in its very nature, of such organizations could not be large. Ordinarily, the efficient running of a large volunteer corps based on force implies the possibility of the use of force in the event of breach of discipline. In such bodies little or no stress is laid on a man’s character. Physique is the chief factor. The contrary must obtain in non-violent bodies in which character or soul force must mean everything and physique must take second place. It is difficult to find many such persons. That is why non-violent corps must be small, if they are to be efficient. Such brigades may be scattered all over; there may be one each for a village or a  mohallalibtech_767_footnotelibtech_768_footnote. The members must know one another well. Each corps will select its own head.  All the members  will  have  the   same   status,  but  where
 
 everyone is doing the same work there must be one person under whose discipline all must come, or else the work will suffer. Where there are two or more brigades the leaders must consult among themselves and decide on a common line of action. In that way alone lies success.
 If non-violent volunteer corps are formed on the above lines, they can easily stop trouble. These corps will not require all the physical training given in  akhadaslibtech_769_footnotebut a certain part of it   will  be necessary.
 One thing, however, should be common to members of all such organizations and that is implicit faith in God. He is the only Companion and Doer. Without faith in Him these peace brigades will be lifeless. By whatever name one calls God, one must realize that one can only work through His strength. Such a man will never take another’s life. He will allow himself, if need be, to be killed and thereby live through his victory over death.
 The mind of the man in whose life the realization of this law has become a living reality will not be bewildered in a crisis. He will instinctively know the right way to act.
 In spite, however, of what I have said above I would like to give some rules culled from my own experience :
 A 	volunteer may 	not carry any weapons. The 	members of 	a corps must be 	easily recognizable.  Every 	volunteer must 	carry bandages, 	scissors, needle and 	thread, surgical knife, 	etc., for rendering first-aid. He 	should know how 	to carry 	and remove 	the wounded.  He 	should know how 	to put out fires, how 	to enter a 	fire area 	without getting 	burnt, how 	to climb heights 	for rescue 	work and 	descend safely with or 	without his charge.  He 	should be 	well-acquainted with 	all the residents of 	his locality. This is a 	service in itself.  He 	should recite 	Ramanama ceaselessly 	in his heart and 	persuade others who 	believe in it to do likewise. 
 There are many who, whether from mental laziness or from having fallen into a bad habit believe that God is and will help us unasked. Why then is it necessary to recite His name? It is true that if
 
 God is, He is, irrespective of our belief. But realization of God is infinitely more than mere belief. That can come only by constant practice. This is true of all science. How much more true of the science of all sciences !
 Man often repeats the name of God parrot-wise and expects fruit from so doing. The true seeker must have that living faith which will not only dispel the untruth of parrot-wise repetition from within him but also from the hearts of others.

 brought a car and asked me if I had ever been in one and if not, would I not go with him for an outing? It never entered my head to suspect him and I acceded to his request.  I was first taken to        where I was gagged and later we proceeded to a house
 in. . . . For some days every effort was made to commit an outrage on me. Then
 one day a wealthy merchant and Congress leader of came and asked me to go and
 enjoy life with him in . . . .
 Later one day I was rescued by a friend of my father’s with the help of the police.
 I  have   received   more   than   one   such   letterlibtech_771_footnoteaccusing   some Congressmen of immorality. It would not be wisdom to believe that they are all untrue and ignore the complaint. It has never been claimed that every Congressman is a model of virtue. But it is a matter of pride that the public expect a high standard of morality from Congressmen. All kinds of immorality are prevalent among us. It is a reformer’s duty to try to wean from error those who  are  justly  accused of misbehaviour. There are limits to immorality, if any can be claimed to pass muster. If what has been related is true, every man has to ask himself how far he is justified in seeking to satisfy his lust at the expense of innocent girls.

   SWARAJ  THROUGH  SPINNINGlibtech_772_footnote  
 An A. I. S. A. worker writes thus :libtech_773_footnote
 You have said that we must make the spinners self-sufficient and that to obtain swaraj through their activity is  the aim of  the A.  I. S. A.	This
 way lies swaraj, you say. I admit it is right for spinners to learn well all the processes. . . . The quality of yarn and cloth will also improve. But how can we win our freedom this way? How are we to bring home this lesson to the spinners?
Imagine, if all the spinners understood the inner meaning of the
 wheel and span willingly and not under pressure, what an India there would be! The awakening of crores of women spinners would ipso facto produce lakhs of khadi-weavers. Imagine too the numbers of men and women workers needed to bring about this awakening! If such a time comes, textile mills, even if any were working, would have to rely on foreign countries for the sale of their produce. They would not, as they do today, hold imperialistic sway over the villages and cities. There would be Hindu-Muslim unity, all would be truthful, there would be no need to tell anyone to wear khadi, for no cloth other than home-spun would be available. That swaraj is hidden in this revolutionary change should be self-evident to seeing eyes. The question may imply that such a consummation is impossible. If such is the question, it means that swaraj through non-violent means is impossible.libtech_774_footnote
 Another question asked is how the spinners are to be given the requisite education. To seek out the right answer is the main work of the A. I. S. A. Enough research has not so far been done. It is the duty of every A. I. S. A. worker to try to solve the puzzle. Now that we have Congress ministries in several provinces the work should be easy. Let the workers throw themselves heart and soul into it. They will never succeed if they look all the time to the Central Office for help and guidance.

 CHI. PREMA,
 I have gone through your long letter. there is nothing private in it. I have given it to Sushila Pai to read.
 I was not pained by your letter. I see, however, that my vanity is disappearing.  I thought I understood a large number of people.  But  I can now see my ignorance more clearly. I welcome this.
 I do not know when I shall be able to see your activities with my own eyes.libtech_775_footnoteBut I do wish to see them some time.
 It seems to me that you remain excited and tense. If so, that must cease.
 I had written a letterlibtech_776_footnoteto you, but Sushila had held it back.  Now that also will go with this.
 I have put no pressure on you or anybody else, nor wish to. If I have made any mistake in regard to your work, I am ready to rectify it.  Keep your promiseslibtech_777_footnote.  I will discuss this subject with Bapa.

   SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_778_footnote  
 April 26, 1946
 Nobody knew who the miscreantlibtech_779_footnotewas, said Gandhiji, nor would it be right to venture a guess.
 It might be presumed at first flush, that because the victim in this case was a Hindu boy the assailant must be a Muslim and vice versa.
 
 Such speculation, in my opinion, is not only idle but mischievous. We should rather ask ourselves as to how we would have or should have acted, if we were present on the scene.
 To remain passive witnesses to the dastardly attack would cowardly. Should they, then, whip out a knife and pay back the miscreant in his own coin? Both these courses would be wrong, observed Gandhiji. The only becoming course, he told them, would be to plead with the miscreant not to stain his hands with innocent blood. If in doing so they themselves become victims of the miscreant’s anger, they should not mind but should rather welcome it. Such an occasion should provide them with an opportunity to test the sincerity of their daily attendance at the prayer meetings.
 When passions rise high and panic and mass hysteria lay hold on the people, it is up to the man of prayer to keep his head above the storm and refuse to sink to the level of the brute. We should pray to God to help us to keep down the hatred and anger in the heart. To be able to conquer anger and hatred and all other baser passions is the fruit of prayer. It is braver far to disarm the miscreant with cool determination devoid of anger than to counter him with a dagger, to prevent an angry word from escaping one’s lips than to indulge in abuse.
 He recalled another instance of assault on a harmless German during the Victory Day disturbances in Delhi that had been brought to his notice the day before. The madness at the time was directed against Englishmen and Europeans. In his opinion, it was not less cowardly.
 We should pity the ruffian. A Maulana  who  saw  me  just  before I started for the prayer was telling me how a number of newspapers were fanning the flames of communal hatred day after day and week after week. They are the real culprits. To incite murder  is as bad if not worse than the murder itself. The actual murderer is very often an ignorant tool, victim of mischievous propaganda.
 But even such propaganda could take effect only in a vitiated atmosphere. In a healthy atmosphere it would be sterilized.
Panic is the result of fear after all. But a man of prayer knows
 no fear. Your prayer is vain repetition if it does not clear the atmosphere of fear, panic and mass hysteria.

   LETTER TO PREMA KANTAK  
 DELHI,
 April 27, 1946
 CHI. PREMA,
You have raised three issues in your letter.
  After 	completing their 	training in 	the camp 	the women 	are bound 	to give 	their services to the 	Kasturba Trust. The Trust is bound to give them work and pay them.  In 	every district one 	mature and 	experienced woman 	and one comparatively 	younger woman should be posted. 
 Though these points are not included in the rules of the Trust, as I had promised you before the rules were framed, all the  three demands have been accepted.
At the same time it is also recommended that :
  Efforts 	should be 	made to 	collect as much money as possible 	from the place 	concerned and the district.  Where 	work can be done through one mature 	and experienced 	woman, only 	one should be posted, 	for, posting two 	women of 	the same 	age and experience 	at the 	same place is 	likely to 	result in conflict 	between them. 	There should be no 	 objection, however, 	to posting 	two women 	if one 	of them 	is elderly 	and the other 	young. This should 	be treated 	as an exception. 	Care should 	be taken 	 to see 	that the 	exception does not 	become the rule.

   SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_780_footnote  
 April 27, 1946
 Speaking after the prayers . . . Gandhiji dwelt on the danger of giving credence to panicky reports. Newspapers had reported that Bombay was full of panic, Hindus dared not go into Muslim quarters and vice versa, the shops were closed early in the evenings, the streets deserted and the people did not venture out at night for fear of riots breaking out.  All that had proved to be a Press canard.  Gandhiji said that these
 
 
 
 false reports had reached him only today. There was neither any panic nor disturbance worth nothing in Bombay. Hindu women and children freely visited and went about  in Muslim quarters and vice versa. The whole story was faked. In Delhi itself a Hindu woman was being driven by a Muslim tonga-driver only the day before. The driver had expressed amazement and horror at what taking place. “Why should there be any quarrel between Hindus and Muslims?” he had asked, and added, “God turns his back on those who quarrel amongst themselves.” That showed, remarked Gandhiji, how dangerous it was to give credence to panicky rumours.
 The lesson to be learnt from all this is, that we should not be afraid, because people will always frighten the timid, not the brave.
 But it was no use making a show of bravery when there was fear in  the  heart. Probably they had all heard about a child playing with a snake without coming to harm. But if a grown-up person who was afraid of snakes tried to play with one, it would detect fear in the very touch and probably bite him. But suppos- ing they were afraid and wanted to shed fear, the first condition was that they must not carry any arms. They should put faith in God and depend upon Him to protect them. The man who was afraid and carried arms repudiated God and made the arms  his God.
 Later, Gandhiji reverted to the theme of nature cure and talked about ether. Man was made of clay but even clay was prevaded by ether. The cavities in the human body, the pores in the human skin were all filled by ether. The stars, the sun and the moon were suspended in the void. The astronomers said there were many a heavenly body, like the sun and the stars which the human eye could not see. Gandhiji wanted them to stretch their mental vision so as to grasp the infinity of ethereal space. Ether was the most intangible thing known to man, but it was occupied by something still more intangible, namely, God.
 In nature cure they had to establish contact with ether as with the earth. They could sleep under the sky and have as much empty space around them as possible. If they attuned themselves to ether they would realize what insignificant little creatures they were and how ill-becoming it was for them to quarrel amongst themselves.
 Gandhiji referred to his visit to the Bhangi quarters on Saturday morning. He lived on the outskirts of the Bhangi quarters. But his was a clean and airy place, where he could live all his life. The Bhangi quarters were dirty and filthy. Their rooms were dark and ill-ventilated. There was just one little vantilator in the room,  so that he felt suffocated as he entered it. It was a shame that their brethren should live in that state. Gandhiji told the gathering to visit the Bhangi quarters. The Harijans had a right to feel that his claim to be one of them was more than mere idle talk.
We are all made of earth, ether and the rest of the five elements.
 God makes no distinction between man and man. By ourselves we are insignificant worms. We become great when we reflect His greatness. If we are attuned to Him, illness will not touch us. And if perchance we do fall ill, we shall be content to seek cure only through His grace by the application of the simplest means provided by nature and not run about hither and thither to find ways and means to prolong our lives.

   QUESTION BOX  
 CRIMINALS AND NON-VIOLENCE
 Q.	What whould be the treatment meted out to criminals in free India in the light of your non-violence?
A. In independent India of the non-violent type, there will be
 crime but no criminals. They will not be punished. Crime is a disease like any other malady and is a product of the prevalent social system. Therefore, all crime including murder will be treated as a disease. Whether such an India will ever come into being is another question.

   ADDRESS  TO  CONGRESS 		 SEVA  DAL  VOLUNTEERSlibtech_784_footnote  
 NEW DELHI,
 April 28, 1946
 Gandhiji said that it would have been better if the report had been sent to the Congress leaders.
 The volunteers had been in attendance in his camp. Mahtma Gandhi thanked them for the service they had rendered him and his party. He knew the volunteers had worked hard and had been doing night-and-day duty. He felt grateful for the love and diligence with which they had served him and his party. But what was the use of their serving him if they served not the lowest among the low who were his next-door neighbours. They kept his place spotlessly clean but the sweepers’ quarters next door were extremely dirty. It was their shame as it was his. He would not be satisfied till they served the sweepers as they had served him. They should rather go and serve the Bhangis who lived next door to him in filth and squalor. Such service carried with it its own reward. He had come to live in the filth in which they lived. The fault was not theirs but of those who had reduced them to that state. The quarters provided for them were worse than the worst prison cell that he had seen in India or in South Africa.
 Mahatma Gandhi recalled how he had written to Mr. Birlalibtech_785_footnote, Mr. Viyogi Hari
 and Mr. Brijkrishna Chandiwala to make arrangements for his stay in sweepers’ quarters. They had done it. He was Mr. Birla’s guest even here, as the management and the expenses were Mr. Birla’s. The result was that he was neither in Birla House nor in the Bhangi quarters.
 Gandhiji said he had identified himself with the Bhangis mentally, but he could not live like them. The Bhangis had a right to feel that his claim was an idle one. He would like them to go and work in the Bhangi quarters so that the place became as clean as where he was staying.
 If they went to the Bhangi quarters, not as  their patrons  or   teachers   but as  their true  servants,  they would  be  able  to   reach   their   hearts   and   trans- form  the  look  of  things  in  no  time.  The  volunteers were  not  do  this  by ordering  the  Bhangis.  They  were  to  be   their   humble   and   silent   servants. Today those who became volunteers had a lurking desire to be counted as leaders. This, he added, was bad. Their one ambition should be to serve those whom we have made the lowest of the low.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
 NEW DELHI,
  April 	28, 1946  Gandhiji 	reminded the gathering that that was the last Sunday of the month. 	It was customary to have flag salutation on that day and render more 	service than usual. Those who believed in spinning span more than 	usual on that day. He had been to see the volunteers in the morning. 	From the report that was read out he had gathered that they were 	doing a lot of good work. Volunteers who would really and truly be 	servants of the people were required in their millions.  There 	was hardly any merit in their serving him. To serve the so-called 	big people in order to gain importance or in order to earn their 	blessings should not be their ideal. Real selfless service carried 	with it its own reward. They should go and serve the Bhangis who 	lived next door to him in filth and squalor.  If 	sincere selfless 	workers came forth in 	their thousands, 	swaraj would be 	theirs for 	the having. The 	Cabinet Mission would 	find itself 	without any 	job. Britons 	would quit India or 	decide to 	stay on 	as her servants. Two 	hundred spinning- 	wheels were plied on the 	prayer grounds for one and a quarter hours. But Gandhiji said that 	this demonstration did 	not come up to his 	requirements. If 	swaraj was 	to come 	through the 	spinning-wheel, everyone 	of them, 	young and old, 	had to 	spin regularly. 	To those who easily lost their temper his prescription was to spin in silence.  The 	late Sir Prabhashanker 	Pattanilibtech_786_footnoteused 	to suffer 	from insomnia. Gandhiji 	advised him 	to spin 	before going to 	bed, avoiding 	all talk of 	politics. He 	did it 	for a 	year round and wrote to him saying the prescription worked wonderfully well.  The 	Hindustan Times, 	19-4-1946      CASTE  CORROSION    	Soil corrosion eats up good soil. It is bad enough. Caste corrosion 	is worse, it eats up men and divides men from men. Letters continue 	to come from Christians, Parsis, naturally, from Scheduled Castes 	and women.They require representation in the ministry. Provincial 	competition is already there. The makers of ministries are not free 	from the taint and even when they do not favour it, they will lose 	caste if they dare to do the right thing and restrict their choice 	to merit only. Democracy can only represent the average, if not less 	than the average. Therefore, a democratic institution to be pure has 	to attend to the all-round education of the humblest and the 	lowliest.  It    
 must take in its sweep all superstition and social abuse. In such a society there will be no Christian and non-Christian, there will be no distinction of sex. If best persons are women all ministers will belong to that sex, if Parsis they will be all Parsis. That good day may be far off. What is to be done in the meanwhile? Those who feel that they are left out should have patience and rise by dint of service and merit. Those who happen to be ministers should mete out even justice which must include extra effort to raise the neglected and the downtrodden. They should make all feel at every step that they are servants, not masters, of the nation.

   MARCH OF CIVILIZATION  
 Q. On page 91 of Harijan 14-4-’46,libtech_787_footnoteit has been argued that the bullock is a living machine and that contact  with  such  harmless  animals  is   a  potent  factor   in the onward march of human civilization. The animals are however,  made ‘harmless’ by making them ‘impotent’. Is this the correct method of the onward march of civilization? If we have cows, we must have bulls. The bullock is a creation of human selfishness and cruelty. If not in thinking man, in the lower animals at any rate, all the force of their nature rages in the fury of the generative desire. Therefore, to turn the noble animal, the ‘Vahana of Mahadev’libtech_788_footnote, into a beat of burden is sad.
 A. The writer is logical. But such logic would prevent the domestication of the cow. For there is probably more cruelty in domesticating the cow than in castrating the bull. It is a question of degree. Further march of civilization seems to imply increasing domination of man over beast, together with a growingly humane method of using them.
 There are three schools of humanitarians. One believes in replacing animal power by the use of any other. Another believes in treating animals as fellow-beings and making such use of them as a brotherly spirit will permit. The third will not make use of lower animals for man’s selfish purpose but will employ  instead  one’s power and that of fellow-beings to the extent that the latter give intelligent and willing use. I belong to the third school. It is possible
 
 by human labour, judiciously and humanely employed, to do fruit culture to a large extent and even corn culture. Indeed, as prisoners we civil resisters in the Transvaal dug up stony ground for converting it into a municipal garden. No ploughing would have answered the purpose. The ground could yield only to the pickaxe.
 The first I hold to be useless and even injurious in the end to mankind. A judicious combination of the other two seems to me to be the goal. I can see no escape from castration. The only thing to  be done is to make it progressively humane.
 A correspondent has brought forward in this connection the question of branding animals. Does the pain caused by branding compensate for the benefit it confers upon the  owner  and  the  animal? If it confers none on the animal, naturally, branding must be taboo.

 Harijan, 5-5-1946
 
   INDEPENDENCE  
 Friends have repeatedly challenged me to define independence. At the risk of repetition, I must say that the independence of my dream means Ramarajya, i.e., the Kingdom of God on Earth. I do not know what it will be like in Heaven. I have no desire to know the distant scene. If the present is attractive enough, the future cannot be very unlike.
 In concrete terms, then, the independence should be political, economic and moral.
 ‘Political’ necessarily means the removal of the control of the British army in every shape and form.
 ‘Economic’ means entire freedom from British capitalists and capital, as also their Indian counterparts. In other words, the humblest must feel eqaul to  the tallest.  This can take place only by  capital or capitalists  sharing  their  skill  and  capital  with  the  lowliest  and the least.
 ‘Moral’ means freedom from armed defence forces. My conception of Ramarajya excludes replacement of the British army by a national army of occupation. A country that is governed by even its national army can never be morally free and, therefore, its so-called weakest member can never rise to his full moral height.
 Though Mr. Churchill is claimed to have won the war for the British, he has in his Aberdeen speech uttereed words of wisdom from the standpoint of a radical non-violent reformer. He knows, if any panoplied warrior knows, what havoc the two wars of our generation have wrought. In another column I reproduce the summary of his speech as reported in the public Press.libtech_789_footnoteOnly I must warn the public against the pessimistic note underlying the speech. Nothing will be found to have gone wrong if mankind recoils from the horrors of war. The bloodletting that men have undergone to the point of whiteness will not have been in vain, if it has taught us that we must freely give our own blood in the place of taking other people’s blood, be the cause ever so noble or ignoble.
 If the Cabinet Mission ‘delivers the goods’, India will have to decide whether attempting to become a military power she would be content to become, at least for some years, a fifth-rate power in the world without a message in answer to the pessimism described above, or whether she will by further refining and continuing her non-violent policy prove herself worthy of being the first nation in the world using her hard-won freedom for the delivery of the earth from the burden which is crushing her in spite of the so-called victory.,

   KANU  GANDHI’S  CAMPlibtech_790_footnote  
 This issue contains an abridged account of Kanu Gandhi’s second camplibtech_791_footnote.  How the candidateslibtech_792_footnotewere selected, how there was no financial loss, how beginning with cleaning latrines they carried out all the other work, what they ate, etc., are all matters worthy of attention. The smallest detail was not neglected. The running of this camp will serve as a guide to others who wish to organize or attend training camps.
 The secret of Kanu Gandhi’s camp lay, in my opinion, in the fact that the organizers knew their job and were there as workers rather than for issuing orders. Where the organizers are mere superintendents the work is often apt to be lifeless or slack.
 
 It is sad that the camp had to be of short durationlibtech_793_footnote.  There were strong reasons for this being so. Let us hope that those who came for training will utilize in their own lives the lessons they learnt and thus make progress towards becoming perfect servants of the people.

  	Lawrence told me last night that you had written to him suggesting 	some alterations in his letter and that he had sent you a reply.libtech_811_footnoteWhat is all this ? I could not say much in the matter 	but I did not like it. I am perplexed. It looks like I shall have to 	go to Simla. The mind shrinks from the thought. I feel somewhere in 	some way we    
 are committing a mistake.
 You must also consider what you intend to do after the British army withdraws. I cannot quite see what you could do.
 You have announced that the present Working Committee will continue till November and you will continue as president till then. If you must continue, it does not seem proper that you should do so by  a ruling. Giving such a ruling seems to me dangerous thing to do. If it becomes a duty to continue this can be done only through fresh elections. This matter deserves consideration.
 Yours sincerely,

   TALK  WITH  MADAN 		 MOHAN  MALVIYAlibtech_812_footnote  
 [April 29, 1946]libtech_813_footnote
 In reply to Gandhiji’s question as to what he proposed to  do  since  the  venue  of  the  Cabinet Mission  talks  was  going  to  be  shifted  to   Simla, Malaviyaji said he would be returning to Benares. That relieved Gandhiji as he was half afraid lest in his irrespressible enthusiasm this enfant terrible  should decide  to venture up the heights of Simla.  That would be courting disaster at his age and  in his present state of health. Gandhiji asked him, marvelling at his perennial freshness :
 How long are you to continue to worry over  the  country’s affairs ?
 “So long as the country’s affairs continue to cause worry,” he replied, with a merry twinkle in his eyes.
 Won’t you leave something to a youth like myself ? It will make me even younger.
 “This young man,” replied Malaviyaji in an audible whisper, his eyes beaming at his visitor, “is going to remain young for many a day yet.”
 You can entrust any of your burdens to me. The only condition is that you must cease worrying and bless me with some of your strength.
 
 The name of God is the strength of our strength.
 That is true. The recitation of Ramanama is there all the time. But where from shall I bring your learning ? I am not flattering. I have neither your erudition nor your knowledge of the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata lore.
 But you have God’s name which is the quintessence of all knowledge. Is it
  not 	?   That 	is true, but all the same I do feel jealous of your learning. 
  	But now you must get well and make use of all your learning to that 	end.  I 	will get well.libtech_814_footnote  It 	is a national menace, this spread of vegetable ghee, on the one 	hand, and the slaughter of the cows on the other. Between the two 	the vitality of the people is being sapped. I feel so happy over 	what you have done and are doing for the milk supply.  Gandhiji 	agreed with him as regards the menance of vegetable ghee and added :  	My efforts to solve the milk problem, of course continue, but 	success is not possible without the full co-operation  of our 	commercial and trading class. But I must now take leave of you.  Malaviyaji 	smiled leave and blessings in reply, making namaskara 	at the same time. As 	Gandhiji rose from his seat he (Malaviyaji) slowly recited the 	following verse :  Forget 	not yourself,  But 	continue to spread your fragrance wherever you are, Even like the 	rose.  Harijan, 	12-5-1946      A  TALKlibtech_815_footnote    May 1, 1946libtech_816_footnote  The 	Government had 	thoughtfully placed 	at Gandhiji’s disposal 	a  big 	bungalow at 	Simla and 	made transport 	arrangements for him and 	his party. Should he 	avail himself 	of these 	without stint? 	His faith 	in God 	and his detachment, he 	felt, were on trial.  Further reduction in the staff seemed hardly feasible.  But did he hope to      
 cope with the situation through unaided human effort? And if he was to be merely an instrument for carrying out the Divine Will, were outward trappings necessary for his purpose ?
We are up against heavy odds. There is so much corruption,
 falsehood and deceit all round. How can I cut my way through it and come out of it unscathed, except by the use of the sharp axe of detachment. In this hour of trial I wish to put myself entirely in God’s hands and proceed to Simla all alone. But I do not want to do so unless I can carry you with me. To force my will upon you would be the negation of detachment.
 None or all, faith cannot be divided. You cannot trust me to God in part. As the poet says, “What of faith in aught is want of faith in all.”libtech_817_footnote

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 NEW DELHI,
 May 1, 1946
 
 Mahatma Gandhi referred to the British Cabinet Mission and said that the Mission had come with good intentions, but that the extent of the Mission’s success would depend on the people’s own strength and purity. If they did not have these, they were bound to be disappointed.
 Mahatma Gandhi expressed regret that he had to leave for Simla. Human nature was such that one became attached to the environment. The people of Delhi had been very good and had joined the prayers whole-heartedly. He said he was going to Simla out of a sense of duty. During summer his heart was at Mahabaleshwar. Doctors had advised him to spend two or three months in the hot weather at Mahabaleshwar or Panchagani. But he had to go to Simla instead, and he had to go by a special train which was a matter of shame for him and for them.
 Gandhiji said people crowded at stations, and their noisy  affection  embarrassed him. He wished to live up to the age of 125 years, yet he was an old man and could not bear the din and the noise. What did it matter if the Government paid
 
 the fare for the special train? The money came from the pockets of the poor. Special trains were used for high officials or dangerous prisoners. He had to use them to escape the loud expressions of affection.  It was their duty perhaps to go to stations  to see their leaders, but their affection must be subdued and disciplined.

   CERTAIN QUESTIONS  
 A London friend has put seven questions on the working of non-violence. Though similar questions have been dealt with in Young India or Harijan, it is profitable to answer them in a single article, if perchance the answers may prove helpful.
 Q. 1. Is it possible for a modern State (which is essentially based on force) to offer non-violent resistance for countering internal as well as external forces of disorder? Or is it necessary that people wanting to offer non-violent resistance should first of all divest themselves of State-authority and place themselves vis-a-vis the opponent entirely in a private capacity?
A. It is not possible for a modern State based on force, non-
 violently to resist forces of disorder, whether external or internal.A man cannot serve God and Mammon, nor be ‘temperate and furious’ at the same time. It is claimed that a State can be based on non- violence, i. e., it can offer non-violent resistance against a world combination based on armed force. Such a State was Ashoka’s. The example can be repeated. But the case does not become weak even if it be shown that Ashoka’s State was not based on non-violence. It has to be examined on its merits.
 Q. 2.  Do you think that it would be possible for a  Congress government  to deal with foreign aggression or  internal  riots  in  an  entirely  non-violent manner?
A. It is certainly possible for a Congress government to deal
 with “foreign aggression or internal riots” in a non-violent manner. That the Congress may not share my belief is quite possible. If the Congress changes its course, the change will prove nothing save that the non-violence hitherto offered was of the weak and that the  Congress has no faith in State non-violence.
 Q. 3. Does not the knowledge that the opponent is wedded to non-violence often encourage the bully?
A.    The bully has his opportunity when he  has   to   face   non-
 violence of the weak.  Non-violence of the strong is any day stronger
 than that of the bravest soldier fully armed or a whole host.
 Q. 4. What policy would you advocate if a section of the Indian people tries to enforce by sword a selfish measure which is not only repugnant to others but also basically unjust? While it is possible for an unofficial organization to offer non- violent resistance in such a case, is it also possible for the government of the day to do so?
A. The question assumes a case which can never exist. A non-
 violent State must be broad-based on the will of an intelligent people, well able to know its mind and act up to it. In such a State the assumed section can only be negligible. It can never stand against the delibe- rate will of the overwhelming majority represented by the State. The government of the day is not outside the people. It is the will of the overwhelming majority. It it is expressed non-violently, it cannot be majority of one but nearer 99 against one in a hundred.
 Q. 5. Is not non-violent resistance by the militarily strong more effective than that by the militarily weak?
A.    This is a  contradiction in terms.	There can be no non-
 violence offered by the militarily strong. Thus, Russia in order to express non-violence has to discard all her power of doing violence. What is true is that if those, who were at one time strong in armed might, change their mind, they will be better able to demonstrate their non-violence to the world and, therefore, also to their opponents. Those who are strong in non-violence will not mind whether they are opposed by the militarily weak people or the strongest.
 Q. 6. What should be the training and discipline for a non-violent army? Should not certain aspects of conventional military training form a part of the syllabus?
A. A very small part of the preliminary training received by the
 military is common to the non-violent army. These are discipline, drill, singing in chorus, flag-hoisting, signalling and the like. Even this is not absolutely necessary and the basis is different. The positively necessary training for a non-violent army is an immovable faith in God, willing and perfect obedience to the chief of the non-violent army and perfect inward and outward co-operation between the units of the army.
 Q. 7. Is it not better under the existing circumstances that countries like India and England should maintain full military efficiency while resolving to give non- violent resistance a reasonable trial before taking any military step?
A. The foregoing answers should make it clear that under no
 circumstance can India and England give non-violent resistance a reasonable chance whilst they are both maintaining full military efficiency. At the same time it is perfectly true that all military powers carry on negotiations for peaceful adjustment of rival disputes. But here we are not discussing preliminary peace parleys before appealing to the arbitrament of war. We are discussing a final substitute for armed conflict called war, in naked terms, mass murder.

   A SURE AID  
 A correspondent suggests three aids to self-control, of which two are outward and one is inward. The inward help he describes as follows :libtech_818_footnote
 There is no doubt that Ramanama is the surest aid. If recited from the heart it charms away every evil thought, and evil thought gone, no corresponding action is possible. The outward helps are all useless if the mind is weak. They are super-fluous if the mind is pure. This must not be taken to mean that a pure-minded man can take all the liberties and still keep safe. Such a man simply will not take any liberties with himself. His whole life will be an infallible testimony to the inward purity. The Gita truly says that the mind makes the man and unmakes him. Milton paraphrases the same thought when he says:
 The mind is its own place and in itself
 Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.libtech_819_footnote

   RAMANAVAMI  CELEBRATIONSlibtech_820_footnote  
 They get the best talent from the South at enormous cost for the sake of amusement. The artists who preside are of questionable morals. All this at a religious festival.
 This is a condensation of a correspondent’s letter. When a man begins a downward career, it is difficult to say where the deterioration
 
 will end. Intoxication of wealth is often as bad as that caused by liquor. The only way to stop this degradation of religious or for that matter any celebrations is for the public not to patronize them.

    SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_821_footnote      SIMLA, 
  May 	2, 1946  	I did not know that I would have to come to Simla this time. If we 	have faith in God we simply would not care to know beforehand how He 	may dispose of us. It is enough for us to hold ourselves perfectly 	in readiness for whatever happens. We are not allowed to know what 	tomorrow has in store for us and our best conceived plans have a 	knack very often of going awry. The highest wisdom therefore is 	never to worry about the future but to resign ourselves entirely to 	His Will.  	I do not propose to say anything here about the Cabinet  Mission. 	And I would like you, too, for your part, to repress your curiosity 	about it. Let us all mutely watch and pray. As I told the people, 	who attended the evening prayer gathering at Delhi yesterday, the 	Cabinet Mission will not be able to go beyond what is warranted by 	our strength. We shall be fools to think otherwise. Even if they 	tried to go beyond, it would only cause us surfeit and we would not 	be able to take advantage of it. Therefore, even if the Mission 	should prove infructuous I would not blame them for it. Rather I 	would blame ourselves for our weakness. It would enable us to 	measure our strength. By strength I mean non-violent strength. We 	are pledged to gain swaraj non-violently.  	Many people today share the belief, and I am one of them, that this 	time the Cabinet Mission will do the right thing by India and that 	the British power would finally and completely be withdrawn. Time 	alone will show how far this belief is justified.  	Now to take up  the  question  I  want  to  talk  to  you  about. 	Last time also I had mentioned it. But truth is  such  a  thing  	that  one may repeat it from the house-tops any number of times 	without    
 getting tired of it, just  as  one  is  not  tired  of  repeating  the  name  of God.  Hypocrites  too  have  the   name  of   God   on   their   lips but what we use is it if they carry a knife under their arms? If Ramanama comes out of the heart one would never feel tired of it. So never mind if I repeat endlessly whatever I want to say. It is bound to have its impact on you. The first mantra of the Ishopanishad says that God pervades the universe and it is man’s duty to surrender his all to God in the first instance. There is nothing which he can call his own. Having made the surrender man is to take out of it what he may require for his legitimate needs but not a whit more. He must not covet what belongs to others. Take my instance. I have been housed here in a palatial building. For fear of your embarrassing affection I had to seek Government’s hospitality and they put me up here. That however does not mean that since the Government have placed a big bungalow at my disposal I am free to make use of the whole of it. Tolstoy, in one of his inimitable parables, has answered the question, how much land a man requires. The Devil tempts a man by granting him a boon that all the land that he can circumscribe by running around shall be his. The man runs and runs, goades by his greed and in the end when the sun is just sinking below the horizon, he reaches back the starting point only to drop down dead. Six feet of the earth is all the land that he requires for his burial. If, therefore, I were to delude myself with the belief that I needed the whole of this bungalow and took possession of it, I would be set down as a fool. Only a perverse nature can interpret the verse to mean that after making a ceremony of offering everything to God one can indulge oneself in the good things of life to an unlimited extent. That would be a travesty of its true meaning. I would far rather like to see a man dressed in old, mended clothes than in gaudy new ones. To wear torn clothes is a sign of laziness and therefore a matter of shame, but to wear patched clothes proclaims your poverty or renunciation and industry. Similarly, if someone gives me Rs. 25,000 and I spend it on my person I am a robber and thief. I can use only enough for my bare needs. That would be the teaching of the Ishopanishad. If you understand this you will achieve great things.

  	Why do you fall ill ? Are you careless about the diet ? Do you take 	no vegetables other than potatoes ? Write to me in detail. Read this 	letterlibtech_823_footnoteand 	return it to me when I come.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	the Gujarati original : Pyarelal Papers. Nehru Memorial Museum and 	Library. Courtesy : Beladevi Nayyar and Dr. Sushila Nayyar      IS KHADI TOTTERING?    	To those who have no faith khadi is tottering. In reality it is 	gaining ground. From being the poor man’s staff of life, it is 	trying  to become the non-violent means of gaining independence. The 	difficulty is fairly clearly expressed in the following paragraphslibtech_824_footnotelibtech_825_footnotefrom 	a letter from Tamil Nadu.  The 	A. I. S. A. is faced with 	two problems 	now. The one is to keep 	on the 	khadi production on 	the present 	methods. The other 	is to give 	re-orientation  to our activity related to artisans and their villages where we seve.  The 	commercial production as it is, is seriously affected in the last 	few months owing to competition of the uncertified merchants in 	khadi. The uncertified merchants buy the yarn from our spinners who 	spin with better cotton supplied by us. They buy khadi woven by the 	weavers... for by giving extra wages . . . . The khadi thus bought 	is sold . . . at higher prices.  There 	are more  than fifty uncertified  khadi  	dealers  in  this  area. 	 Among these are 	Congressmen also, 	who occupy 	places in 	the Congress Executive.  We 	are not able to influence the artisans against being exploited by 	the uncertified merchants. They simply say that they are not able to 	resist the temptation of higher wages for inferior labour and with 	no conditons that we impose with regard to quality and their wearing 	khadi, etc. . . . .  This 	tendency among 	the artisans is 	a great 	impediment and 	obstacle in 	approaching them 	with our ideal of village 	reconstruction through the charkha. The 	present method of khadi production has to be sacrificed if      
 it hinders re-orientation. This requires faith and alertness which faith brings. Faith never accrues to the lazy.
 Uncertified khadi dealers are a powerful menace to khadi whether from the standpoint of the poor man or of non-violence. For the dealer knows only his own pocket and nothing else matters to him. Of course, he goes to the weaver and the spinner and makes all kinds of promises, not knowing that if he killed the A. I. S. A. he would kill himself.
 The pity of it all is that Congressmen become willing tools in the hands of these uncertified dealers. They have brought into being an association of specialists. Yet they do not know that they are willingly or unwillingly killing the goose that lays the golden egg. They have a right to do so in any case, more so if they do not believe in khadi as the non-violent insturment of swaraj.
 It has been suggested to me that the policy of the A. I. S. A. can be changed only after consultation with Congressmen. This is wrong in the nature of things. The A. I. S. A. is composed of Congressmen. Though created by the Congress, it is an autonomous body. It can be disowned by the Congress at any time but while it is owned it must be trusted to do the right thing in terms of swaraj. Part payment in yarn is a potent cause of worry to Congressmen. This should not be so, if they believe that khadi is a symbol of non-violence and all that it implies. If such is not the belief the clause about compulsory wear of khadi should be given up.
 Moreover, khadi furnishes the acid test of public honesty. It is a great effort to find the best way of inducing honesty in public dealings, for it means coming in close and selfless touch with the millions of men and women in the villages.
 The upshot of it all is that workers like the writer have to carry on their work with full faith in their mission and leave the result in the hands of God.

 [May 3, 1946]libtech_840_footnote
 The world will laugh at me and say, ‘Here is a theatrical man.’ I do not mind it. When one is used to human aids it is not easy to tear oneself away from them all of a sudden. I very conservative in my feelings. I have spent half a day in searching for a small bit of pencil which had been with me for a long time. I could not reconcile myself to its loss. And here I have to detach myself from my entire surroundings and send away a party whom I have trained  and seasoned for my work for years—no easy job.
 It should not be so. All should be same to one who has surrendered his all to God.  My Ramanama will be vain repetition and  I would be a wretched guide for the Congress, the Cabinet Mission and others, if I allowed that feeling of attachment to weigh with me. If they follow my advice it might be like a plunge in the dark. As seasoned politicians they cannot afford to take that risk. My guidance must, therefore, be unalloyed.
 If you are surrounded by your  family, they divide your attention in however small or subtle a measure. I wish in this crisis to
 
 give my undevided self to God.
 “You feel you have to deal with an extraordinarily acute crisis?” asked Agatha Harrison.
Yes, there is a crisis within a crisis. Not only is there the outward
crisis, which you see, but a crisis within myself.
 It remains to be seen how I come out of the test. So far people around me had attended to every little thing for me. If anything went wrong they were responsible. From tomorrow I shall have to do all that myself and blame myself only, if anything goes wrong. With all that I must feel at ease with myself. I shall have to watch myself. It will be a great thing if I survive that detachment and feel the inner joy—not start running high blood-pressure. It is a big experiment in my life and a necessary stage in my spiritual growth.

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 SIMLA,
 May 3, 1946
 I am grieved to know about the immorality prevalent among the people of Simla and its surrounding hills. Simla is the summer capital of the British Government and immorality is a feature common to all capitals. But it does not absolve us from our responsibility. Those who follow immoral ways can be nowhere near God. As in other places, in Simla as well, there is a wide chasm separating man from man. Harijan huts are situated adjacent to the Viceregal mansion.
 I do not believe in having spearate quarters for Bhangis. Those who make it possible for us to live (in sanitary conditons) should have the opportunity to live in open and in the best of localities to enable them to set an ideal in sanitation. But out of sheer callousness we treat them cruelly. Their condition will certainly improve provided every one of us treated them as our own kith and kin.
 Mahatma Gandhi urged the people of Simla to eradicate corruption and to give up the desire to do evil things.
 Gandhiji said they were probably wondering why he was living at “Chadwick”.	He  had  come  to  simla  at  the  instance  of  the  Cabinet   Mission, who had arranged for his accommodation. He would, however, assure the people that  he or any member of his party was using no more room in that big building than they did elsewhere. That was why he had asked Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and others to stay with him.
 Mahatma Gandhi pleaded for amelioration of the living conditions of Harijans and said if everyone decided to take one Harijan to live with him the problem could be solved.

   STATEMENT TO THE PRESS  
 SIMLA,
 May 4, 1946
 Pressmen are inquiring already why my large party is going back. This is a personal question. I would rather avoid answering it, but in these days of publicity and speculation the question can not be evaded. The reason is purely moral, if it may not be described as spiritual. My task as a self-appointed adviser to all the  parties concerned is the most delicate at the present moment. The  Simla venue was declared all of a sudden. It dawned on me that if I was to go to Simla, I must go without the usual party, even though Harijan work might suffer. Had I succeeded in carrying conviction to the members of my party, they would have remained behind in Delhi.libtech_841_footnoteThe time within which the decision was to be taken was only a few hours on the 1st instant. They were anxious for my well-being. The whole moral purpose would be defeated, if I did not carry their mind with me. They, therefore, came to Simla. But the matter was still agitating   me.   So   I   conferred   with   Pyarelal   yesterday.libtech_842_footnotelibtech_843_footnoteHe   felt convinced that I should be left free to put myself solely in God’s keeping, if I was to work under as much detachment as was possible for me. The best part of the afternoon was devoted to prayerful discussion that the party should go back to the heat of Delhi and await me there to rejoin me when I descended. This is the sole reason without reservation.

 The note is something quite different from what you said yesterday. For one thing it does not contemplate independence. It seems to take Pakistan for granted. As I said yesterday nothing can be done so long as the British Army of occupation remains. The people can’t be natural so long as their territory is occupied. Therefore there is no meeting ground in the note.
 You wanted my reaction to what you have sent me and I have given it in the briefest terms possible.
 I am sorry to dissappoint you. But it is the best thing for both of us that you and I should speak frankly to each other.

 Prakash 	must be keeping fit.  From 	a microfilm of the Hindi : Documents relating to Gandhiji. Courtesy 	: National Archives of India      SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_850_footnote    May 	4, 1946  Gandhiji 	explained to the audience 	how his permanent 	staff had shortly 	before left 	Delhi with 	smiling faces and 	his blessings. His 	task was 	very hard. 	But all difficulties 	could be overcome by leaning on God.  Ever since he had reached the 	years  of discretion he had felt that God is always with those who wait on Him.  	In reality He is everywhere but because He is formless and 	invisible, man cannot always sense His presence. But if we have 	listen- ing ears, God speaks to us in our own language, whatever  	that  language be.  Badshah 	Khan had just explained what prayer was. God was all-powerful. Man 	lives at 	His will. 	It was 	because Gandhiji wanted 	in these 	crucial days to rely 	solely  on 	His help 	that he had 	asked his 	people who 	looked after his 	every need and 	helped him 	to edit 	the Harijan 	weeklies to 	leave him to 	God. Yet he 	was not quite without 	human help. He 	had the Fakir 	Badshah Khan with him, the 	Sardar and 	his daughterlibtech_851_footnote, who was as his own daughter, Dr. Dinshaw Mehta and Shri Brijkrishna and Shri Sudhir        Hindustan.  
 Ghosh. Birlaji had sent some of his staff too.
 The British have to end their rule and quit India. They have promised to do so. Yet we should recognize the fact that a handful of Englishmen have been ruling over us. It is shameful not only for us but also for Englishmen. It is because of this feeling of shame that they have resolved to quit and go. That is why I say that their task is the hardest.
 I have come here to advise the Congress and I am well aware of the fact that the Congress has always respected and listened to my counsel. If the Muslim League seeks my advice I shall gladly give it to them. I have to guide the Cabinet Mission as well. I know my task is difficult and equally arduous is the task of the Congress and the Muslim League. But the task of the Cabinet Mission is even more difficult. There are a few persons who are suspicious of the Cabinet Mission and who are afraid that the Mission might betray us. In my opinion it is quite wrong to think so. I have faith in the sincerity of the Cabinet Mission and in their avowed intention of giving up power.
 Gandhiji warned people against believing that Britain was crumbling.
It is a great power.

   A  HARIJAN’S  LETTERlibtech_852_footnote  
 A Harijan friend complains bitterly about my article on sweepers’ strikelibtech_853_footnotelibtech_854_footnote.
His  first  complaint  is  that   I  have  given   up   the   sweet name
 ‘Harijan’ and used “Bhangi” instead. The criticism shows the sensi- tive nature of the correspondent. It was a Gujarati untouchable in the first instance, who suggested the name ‘Harijan’ to me and I willingly adopted it. This does not, however, mean that a current word for any sub-caste may never be used. I count myself a Harijan and it pleases me to call myself a Bhangi among them, because that is the lowest caste of Harijans. When I stayed recently in the sweepers’ quarters in Delhi, the Harijans there too complained against the use of the word ‘Bhangi’. They suggested ‘Mehtar’. I tried to make them understand that it mattered little as to which of the current words was used for the same occupation. In spite of being considered the lowest occupation, it was in fact the highest inasmuch as it protected health and they should be indifferent to the name. Whatever the origin of the word may  be,  ‘Bhangi’  is,  in  my  opinion,  another  name  for   ‘Shivji’libtech_855_footnotelibtech_856_footnote. Whether you call a  sweeper a  Mehtar or a  ‘Bhangi’, like ‘Shivji’ he
 
 brings health to man. The one brings it by keeping the home clean, the other cleanses the mind of man.
 The second criticism is more serious.  Prejudice  are  respon- sible for misunderstandings. If we take by force even that to which we are entitled, the action is likely to lead to a quarrel. We may not even be able to digest what we get by force. The strikers got what they did by coercion. At least, that is my belief. If my occupation is to keep latrines clean and I refused to do the work, can it be termed anything other than coercion? Of course, I am not bound to take up the job of cleaning latrines and I may be said to have every right to lay down my conditions of service. But according to my way of thinking, the laying down of conditions is not an absolute right. Even if such an absolute right were to be permitted, it might not be proper to use it under certain circumstances. But I do not want to enter into the justification of this reasoning. I tried to show in my article the duties of Bhangis as well as of citizens. I have often said that every kind of injustice is meted out to Bhangis. I have no doubt that citizens do not fulfil their obligations to them.libtech_857_footnotelibtech_858_footnoteThus it is their duty to see that Harijan dwellings are built properly, the means employed for cleaning are decent, that they have a special working uniform given to them, that they and their children have facilities for education, etc. These and other problems should be solved without loss of time. The Bhangis may not go on strike for lack of these amenities but it is up to all citizens to raise their voice on behalf of them.
 Yet another criticism is directed against my suggestion of the use of the military to do sweepers’ work. I do not see any wrong in what I said. I have reread my article and am not willing to withdraw one single word of it. I do not regret having written as I did. I advise Harijan friends to read it in the proper spirit. If they do so, they will see that my feelings on their behalf have undergone no change.

   THE  CHARITY  OF 		 THE  RICHlibtech_859_footnote  
The following is the gist of what a friend writes :
 You accept many donations from the wealthy. There can be no doubt that the money is well spent. But the question is as to
 
 
 whether these donations should be accepted for your work. The donors certainly get a name thereby and among them might even be black marketeers. Can such charity benefit the poor?
 The question really boils down to whether donations are in themselves wrong. I have no doubt in my mind about their being so. But the world works differently. The author of the Gita has said that all undertakings are tainted.libtech_860_footnotelibtech_861_footnoteTherefore, all action should be performed with complete detachment. The Ishopanishad begins by saying that all action must be preceded by a full surrender of everything to God. It must, however, be admitted that even if everyone ceased to receive charity, the rich would not cease to amass wealth. It is also a fact that some rich people are stingy enough never to give anything in charity. Some even give money for nefarious purposes. Therefore, all that one can say is that certain principles should be observed in the matter of receiving charity. Not one pie should be taken for selfish ends and all should be received with God as witness.
 I do, however, hold that it would be wrong to receive money from any group or individual whom the recipient considers to be unworthy. The discussion is naturally relevant only for those who are troubled by concientious scruples.

   TO  CORRESPONDENTSlibtech_865_footnote  
 My daily post may be said to have increased fourfold since the Harijan weeklies started. It is impossible to answer every letter. Every communication is read but not by me. If I attempted to do so I would be unable to render any service. My staff put before me only what I should see. Much of the post does not merit replies, but questions of public interest are answered in Harijan. Personal correspondence has to be rigidly restricted. I receive a large number of requests for blessings on the occasion of marriages which I am hesitant to send. I have already stated publicly that my blessings should be asked for only such marriages where one of the contracting parties is a Harijan. But in reality where is the need for blessings? Those marriages which are undertaken for the sake of joint service carry their own blessings. Those entered upon for self-satisfaction are wholly unworthy of any. In any event, in these days of famine, no money should be spent on feasts and enjoyment. Weddings will continue, but is it not possible for the event to take place quietly and without fuss?

 It was the heroism and travail of Bardoli that brought to public life men like Shri Bhulabhai Desai. He  might  otherwise  have remained a distinguished Government servant and ended his career as a judge of the Bombay High Court. He reached the heights of fame when his forensic talents resulted in the release of the I.N.A. prisoners. His son and daughter-in-law have in me, like many others, a co-sharer in their grief which it is to be hoped they will turn into joy by inheriting the deceased’s love for the country’s service, which alone makes life worth living.

   DRAFT  LETTER  TO  LORD  PETHICK-LAWRENCElibtech_870_footnote  
 Confidential	THE RETREAT,
 SIMLA,
 May 6, 1946
 DEAR LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE,
 My colleagues and I followed with care the proceedings of the Conference yesterday and tried to understand what our conversations were leading us to.  I confess   to feeling somewhat mystified and disturbed at the vagueness of our talks and some of the assumptions underlying them. While we would like to associate ourselves with every effort to explore ways and means of finding a basis for agreement, we must not deceive ourselves, the Cabinet Mission or the representatives of the Muslim League into the belief that the way the Conference has so far proceeded furnishes hope of success. Our general  approach  to  the  questions  before  us  was  stated briefly in my letter to you of April 28. We find that  this  approach  has  been largely ignored and a contrary method has been followed. We realize that some
 
 assumtions have to be made in the early stages as otherwise there can  be  no  progress. But assumptions which ignore or run contrary tolibtech_871_footnotefundamental issues are likely to lead to misunderstandings during the later stages.
 In my letter of April 28, I stated that the basic issue before us was that of Indian independence and the consequent withdrawal of the British army from India, for there can be no independence so long as there is foreign army on Indian soil. We stand for the independence of the whole of India now and not in the distant or near futre. Other matters are subsidiary to this and can be fully discussed and decided by the Constituent Assembly.
 At the Conference yesterday I referred to this again and we were glad to find that you and your colleagues, as well as the other members of the Conference, accepted independence as the basis of our talks. It was stated by you that the Constituent Assembly would finally decide about the nexus or other relationship that might be established between a free India and England. While this is perfectly true, it does not affect the position now and that is, the acceptance of Indian independence now.
 If that is so, then certain consequences inevitably follow. We felt yesterday that there was no appreciation of these consequences. The Constituent Assembly is not going to decide the question of independence; that question must be and, we take it, has been decided now. That Assembly will represent the will of the free Indian nation and give effect to it. It is not going to be bound by  any  previous arrangements. It has to be preceded by a Provisional Government, which must function, as far as possible, as a Government of free India, and which  should undertake to make all arrangements for the transitional period.
 In our discussions yesterday repeated references were made to ‘groups’ of provinces functioning together, and it was even suggested that such group would have an executive and legislative machinery. This method grouping has not so far been discussed by us but still our talks seemed to presume all this. I should like to make it very clear that we are entirely opposed to any executive or legislative machinery for a group of provinces or units of the Federation. That will mean a sub-federation, if not something more, and we have already told you that we do not accept this. It would result in creating three layers of executive and legislative bodies, an arrangement which will be cumbrous, static and disjointed, leading to continuous friction. We are not aware of any such arrangement in any country.
We are emphatically of the opinion that it is not open to the
 Conference to entertain any suggestions for a division of India. If that is to come, it should come through the Constituent Assembly free of any infuence of the present Paramount Power.libtech_872_footnote
 Another point we wish to make clear is that we do not accept the proposal for
 
 parity as between groups in regard to the executive or the legislature. We realize that everything possible should be done to remove fears and suspicions from the mind of every group and community. But the way to do this is not by unreal methods which go against the basic principles of democracy on which we hope to build up our constitution.
 Yours sincerely,

  	I got your letter, in fact, two letters. I see that your work is 	progressing well. No good work is accomplished in a day. A job that 	can be finished in one day cannot be of much value. We must, 	therefore, cultivate patience, and for that we should learn non- 	attachment. Non-attachment implies faith that only good results can 	follow from good actions. This firm faith should make us indifferent 	to the results. We are certain that the sun will rise tomorrow and 	do not worry. We should have still deeper faith about the results of 	good works. There is bound to come a day when the sun will not rise; 	but there can be no time when a good deed will not bear good fruit. 	Hence you should go on with your work in the faith that the people 	will one day see its merit. Sanitation comes first, because it 	covers most of the other things.  	I do not have your letter before me while writing these lines. If, 	therefore, I have missed any point, ask me again.  Blessings 	from  BAPU  From 	a copy of the Gujarati. C. W. 2749.

No  doubt,  much of the 	therapy that it offers is sound, and it certainly is cheap.

  May 	6, 1946  	Noise is not erased by making greater noise. It can only be stilled 	by people making mute signs and never  pushing  forward. Peace and 	order are necessary at all gatherings, but are especially so at 	prayer gatherings. People come together for prayers in order to 	obtain peace, to hear God’s name and to recite it. Therefore, 	those who come should really attune themselves even as they start 	from their homes. Let them be silent and let their thoughts dwell as 	they walk, on prayer.  Otherwise coming to prayers is useless.libtech_881_footnote  Mahatma 	Gandhi hoped that, in future, all would try to follow what he had 	said and thus derive full benefit from attending prayers.  The 	Hindu, 8-5-1946; and 	Harijan, 	19-5-1946      TOTAL PROHIBITION    	National Provincial Governments are now in full swing in India. 	Happily on the question of prohibition, there can be no differences 	of     
 opinion between the Congress and the Muslim League. And if all followed a concrete policy and the States too joined in, India would be dry in no time and earn the blessings of lakhs of homes. To the discredit of the Governments under  virtual  martial  law,  Governors and their Advisers had the shamelessness to reverse the policy which had been already adopted in some provinces and misappropriate the revenue which was raised by the  provinces  in  question.  Let  them now take up prohibition with prohibition legislation. They have to devise methods of educating the drinking public in the harm that drink does and privide them with innocent recreation and health- giving drinks. Every bar or, failing that, a place next door to it, should, so far as possible, be utilized as a refreshment and recreation room. If this constructive activity is taken up, it must prove a source  of revenue for the State, besides prohibition, benefiting and reconstructing thousands of ruined homes.
 Moreover, toddy-tapping should be replaced by nira-tapping for the purpose of converting nira into gur, much to the advantage of the nation which needs cheap sugar. These columns have shown how in some ways tad-gur is preferable to cane-gur.
 These reflections are suggested by  the  following  paragraph from a circular letter addressed by the  Women’s  Christian  Temperance Union (Fyzabad Road, Lucknow) to the Press. From it, I take the following itemslibtech_882_footnotelibtech_883_footnoteaddressed to the students under the heading “What Can Youth Do?”
  Pledge 	themselves to total 	abstinence from all 	intoxicants and 	habit- forming 	drugs, which includes tobacoo. . 	. .

 Ramanama is very dear to me. I can easily give it up if I feel that it is an infatuation.
 What you write about Harijan is correct. The fault ought to be removed. I am sending on to Jivanji the relevant portion of your letter.
 It should not be a subject for complaint that I cannot see the friends from Kathiawar. I am perpetually faced with the question whom I should see and whom need not.

      SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING    SIMLA,  May 	7, 1946  Mahatma 	Gandhi, in his 	speech at 	today’s prayer 	meeting, commended the 	quiet which prevailed after his appeal to the audience on the two previous evenings.     
 He asked them all if they could sing in tune and keep proper time to join in the Ramdhun. It was a good habit to cultivate and if they did it from the heart and intelligently they would realize that God’s blessings were in it.  If they co-operated in  a pure thing it would help them to co-operate with their neighbours in all that pertained to the common weal.libtech_887_footnote
 Strange rumours had come to him, he said, in regard to his permanent staff having left. Some people were foolish enough to believe that there had been some domestic quarrel. Those who lived with him were not made of such stuff. Others imagined that because his staff had left, the negotiations had broken down. This too was wholly untrue. They left, as Gandhiji had said beforelibtech_888_footnote, because they understood that he wanted to be alone with God as his only help. Even so he was not without help. It had been so throughtout his life. In South Africa, too, all kinds of people had helped him including Boers, Africans and Europeans.
 The address . . . contained a scathing denunciation of the speculation fever which had seized Simla. He interpreted it as a sign of cowardice. He tried to impress upon them that it arose from fear. He himself was a coward in his early youth. He had learnt to shed his cowardice through the recitation of Ramanama.libtech_889_footnoteIt was cowards who died many times before their death. Fear of disease killed more men that disease itself. He appealed to newspapermen also not to spread false news.  It was their duty  to teach people to be brave and not instil fear into them. The Cabinet Mission had come with the blessings of the Prime Minister, who had said they were coming here to part with power whether Indians agreed among themselves or not. It was not right to distrust or disbelieve anyone so long as there was no cause to do so. Were those who had had the courage to put up a non-violent fight against a mighty empire for 25 years going to yield to frustration if the British Government failed to perform its duty today?libtech_890_footnote
 That would be unworthy of those who had vowed their all to serve the country. They had said the country was theirs and they were going to make her free. If they had fear in them, freedom could never be theirs. The strength that withstands all fear is derived from God. When Gandhiji said he knew no fear, it was not because he was a mahatma. He was not different from any of them. The only difference that there
 
 
 
 
  1946     
 might be between him and them was that he had, perhaps, more faith, more spirit of service, of sacrifice and of renunciation. All those would come to those who believed sacrifice and fear nothing, relying solely on God.

   NOTES  
 NON-VIOLENCE AND KHADI
 The Congress Constitution is undergoing a radical change. The supreme change that is desirable for the sake of avoiding untruth and hypocrisy is to remove the words “legitimate and peaceful” from the first article of the Congress Constitution as also the clause about khadi.libtech_891_footnotelibtech_892_footnoteExperience  shows  that  the  people  who   form   the   bulk   of Congressmen are not wedded either to truth and non-violence or to khadi. As an ardent lover of truth and non-violence and khadi as their symbol, I make bold to suggest that these clauses should go. It will be open to anyone to be truthful and non-violent and to wear khadi if he or she chooses to. Only there will be no  deception practised on India or the world. Paradoxical as it may appear we shall be more truthfullibtech_893_footnotelibtech_894_footnote, more non-violent and better khadi-lovers with the suggested amendment than without. It should be remembered that I myself had at one time moved the removal of these clauses. I was glad I was defeated. It was wrong to be glad. I shall be sorry if my suggestion is rejected even now. Let it not be said of us that we prize hypocrisy above truth.
 COCKTAIL PARTIES
 We seem to be on the eve of attaining independence! Should we ape bad European manner and customs and still prize in- dependence? It would be a sad day for India and the world, if the price we are to pay for independence is cocktail parties and the like. What do the famishing millions know of such parties? Let it not be said of us that our monied men were gay whilst those from whom they made money were famishing for food.
 HARIJAN COOKS
 A correspondent suggests that at the next session of the Congress all the cooks should be Harijans and to that end a corps of
 
 Harijan cooks should be trained in the observance of cleanliness and the art of cooking scientifically and as behoves a poor country like ours. He would have this privilege and duty given to the Congressmen in the province in which the Congress session is to be held. After the session these cooks should be taken over by those Congressmen who can afford it and keep cooks. Any suggestion like this which shows in practice that untouchability is a thing of the past is to be welcomed. I would only add that Concressmen who endorse it need not wait for the session. They should from now take up Harijans not merely as their cooks but have them in all other capacities. What is more, let those who can afford it take Harijans in their families as their own children and give them proper training. All this can only happen if men and women are sincere in their professions and if the truth had gone home that under the garb of religion Hinduism is said to have consigned to untouchability their own kith and kin for no fault of theirs.

   QUESTION  BOXlibtech_895_footnote  
 Q. The Congress Constitution makes it incumbent on all its candidates standing  for  election  to  be  habitual  wearers  of  hand-spun   and   hand-woven khadi. Does this not imply that they can only use that khadi which is certified by the
 A. I. S. A?
 In 	my opinion it 	cannot be otherwise. 
 Q.	Is s dealer in uncertified khadi eligible to hold offer in a Congress committee?
A. It is beyond my conception as to how a dealer in uncertified
 khadi can be a Congressman, leave alone an aspirant, for holding office in any Congress Committee.
 Q. You say that a dealer in uncertified khadi cannot even be a Congressman much less an office-holder. But what about those who are office-holders in the Congress and who deal in mill cloth and even sell foreign cloth?
A.    My answer to the second question is equally applicable to
 the persons referred to in the third. It is for these very reasons that I have recommended the removal of the relevant clauses from the Congress Constitution.libtech_896_footnotelibtech_897_footnoteExperience has taught us that we are unable
 
 to adhere to the rules in question.

   LETTER TO SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS  
 CHADWICK,   SMILA WEST,
 May 8, 1946
 DEAR SIR STAFFORD,
 The  four  Congress   delegateslibtech_898_footnotehad   a   warm   debate   over   the Cabinet Mission’s suggestionlibtech_899_footnotelibtech_900_footnote.  The foremost was that if the delegates accepted it, it was binding on them and its terms were binding on them and therefore the Congress unless the latter repudiated them. The same would be the case with the League. On the strength of what you told me last nightlibtech_901_footnoteI said they were binding on no one. The Consti- tuent Assembly would be free to throw out any of the items and the members of the two delegations were equally free to add to or amend the suggestions before the Constituent Assembly. I added  that theywere meant only as a scaffolding by means of which the two institutions could be brought to the Constituent Assembly adumbrated in the draft. If you are able to confirm the above and are free to make a public declaration to that effect, the main difficulty would be over.
 As to merits, the difficulty about parity between six Hindu majority Provinces and the five Muslim majority Provinces is insurmountable.  The  Muslim  majority Provinces  represent  over nine crores of the population as  against  over  19  crores  of  the Hindu majority  Provinces.  This  is  really  worse  than  Pakistan.  What is suggested in [its] place is that the Central Legislature should be framed on the population basis and so too the executive. If this is considered unfair, an impartial non-British tribunal should award on this as on many other matters of difference otherwise incapable of
adjustment.  If these two points are cleared my way would be clear.libtech_902_footnote

   SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING  
 
SIMLA,
 May 8, 1946
  Mahatma 	Gandhi said at the outset that as it was Gurudev’slibtech_905_footnotebirthday he could 	speak on nothing but him.libtech_906_footnote  A 	picture of the poet had been put on the dais at the prayer 	gathering. Drawing  the 	attention of 	the gathering 	to it, 	Gandhiji said that the 	inscription under it 	was the 	motto ‘The light that 	never failed’. 	Gurudev’s body was 	reduced to 	ashes but 	the radiance 	that had been 	within him was like 	the sun which 	would shine so long 	as life 	on this 	earth lasted. But 	the light he shed 	was for the soul as the 	sun’s was for the body.  	He was a poet and a literary star of the first magnitude. He wrote 	in his mother tongue and all Bengal is able to drink deep at the 	fountain of his poetry. Translations of his works exist in many 	languages. He was a great writer in English too, perhaps almost 	without knowing it. He had school education but he could boast of no 	university degree. He was just Gurudev. Our Viceroy had called him 	the Poet of Asia, a title that no one before him had had. He was 	also a world poet and, what is more, a rishilibtech_907_footnotelibtech_908_footnote.  	He has left up the Gitanjali, the poems which brought him 	world fame. The great Tulsidas left us his immortal Ramayana. 	The renowned Vedavyasa left us a history of mankindlibtech_909_footnotelibtech_910_footnote.   They  were  not mere poets; they were teachers. 	Gurudev too wrote not only as a poet but as a rishi. Writing, 	however, was not his only gift.  He was an artist,  a dancer, a 	singer, with all the sweetness and purity that art in its finest 	sense should contain. His creative genius has also given us Santini- 	ketan, Sriniketan and Visvabharati. These breathe his spirit and are 	a legacy not only to Bengal but to India. Santiniketan has become, 	as it were, a place of pilgrimage to us all. He was not, in his 	lifetime, able  to make of these institutions what he had dreamed 	for them. What man can? Fulfilment of man’s purpose is in God’s 	hands. But they are monuments to his endeavour and are a constant 	reminder to us of       
 the passionate love he had for his country and the service he rendered to her.You have just heard the national song he wrote, a song which has found a place in our national life. How often is the inspiring refrain heard from thousands of voices! It is not only a song but is also like a devotional hymn.
 Gandhiji ended by exhorting the people to learn the lessons of love of the country, love of the world and selfless service from the noble example which Gurudev had left.

   AYURVEDA  AND  NATURE 		 CURElibtech_911_footnote  
 Vaidya Vallabhram, Professor of Ayurveda and Vanaspati Shastralibtech_912_footnotelibtech_913_footnotewrites :libtech_914_footnote
 Cure through Ayurveda is based on the five elements.	Pathya (diet cure) is a
 scientific term of the greatest importance in Ayurveda. Its real meaning is that freedom from disease depends on a proper observance of the laws of nature.
 I have no doubt whatsoever that the repetition of Ramanama and pure living are the best and the cheapest preventives of disease. The tragedy is that doctors, hakims and vaidyas do not make use of Ramanama as the sovereign of cures. There is no place given to it in current Ayurvedic literature except in the shape of a charm which will drive  people  further  into  the  well  of  superstition.  Ramanama  has in fact no connection with superstition. It is nature’s supreme law. Whoever observes it is free from disease and vice versa. The same law which keeps one free from disease applies also to its cure. An apt question is as to why a man who recites Ramanama regularly and leads a pure life should ever fall ill. Man is by nature imperfect. A thoughtful man strives after perfection, but seldom attains it, for he stumbles on the way, though unwittingly. The whole of God’s law  is embodies in a pure life. The first thing is to realize one’s limi- tations. It  should  be  obvious  that  the  moment  one  transgresses those limits one falls ill. Thus a balanced diet eaten in accordance with needs gives one freedom from disease. How is one to know what is the proper diet for one? Many such problems can be imagined. The purport of all this is that everyone should be his own doctor and find
 
 
 out his limitations. The man who does so will surely live up to the age of 125.
 Vaidya Vallabhram asks whether well-known home drugs and condiments can be included in nature cure. Doctor friends claim that they do nothing more than investigate the laws and act accordingly and that therefore they are the best nature-cure men. Everything can be explained away in this manner. All I want to say is that anything more than Ramanama is really contrary to true nature cure. The more one recedes from this central principle the farther away one goes from nature cure. Following this line of thought I limit nature cure to the use of the five elements. But a vaidya who goes beyond this and uses such herbs as grow or can be grown in his neighbourhood purely for service of the sick and not for money may claim to be a nature-cure man. But where are such vaidyas to be found? Today most of them are engaged in making money. They do no research work and it is because of their greed and mental laziness that the science of Ayurveda is at a low ebb. Instead of admitting their own weakness they throw the blame on Government and public men. Government is powerless to help those who through their own fault become helpless and thereby drag the name of Ayurveda in the mud.

   HOW  CAN  VIOLENCE 		 BE  STOPPED?libtech_915_footnote  
 Q.  Some  time  back  a  military   officer   in   Poona,   who   is   about   to   return  to  England,  said   to   me   that   violence   was   on   the   increase   in   India and  would  further  increase  as  people  were  gradually   turning   away   from   the path of  non-violence.  “We  in  the  West”,  he  said,  “not  only  believe  in   vio- lence but our society is based on it. Several subject races have won their independence through    violence    and    are    today    living    in    peace.    We    have     dis- covered  the  atom   bomb  for  stopping  violence.   The  last  great   war  is   a   case   in  point.”libtech_916_footnoteContinuing,  the  military   officer   said,   “Gandhiji  has  shown  your  people the way of non-violence. Has he discovered any such power as the atom bomb which will at once convert people to non-violence and bring about a rule of peace? Cannot Gandhiji’s ‘atom bomb’ stop people from following the path of violence? Ask Gandhiji to exercise his power over the people and tell them to give up all
 
 thoughts of violence and adopt his creed. If he cannot wean his people today from the terrible violence that is spreading all over the country, I tell you that he will live a disappointed man and his life’s work will be ruined.”libtech_917_footnote
A. There is much confusion of thought in this question. The
 atom bomb has not stopped violence. People’s hearts are full of it and preparations for a third world war may even be said to be going on. While it would be absurd to say that violence has ever brought peace to mankind it cannot either be said that violence never achieves anything.
 That I shall have to repent if I cannot stop violence does not enter into the picture of non-violence. No man can stop violence, God alone can do so. Men are but instruments in His hands. Here material means cannot stop violence but this does not mean that material means should not be employed for the purpose. The deciding factor is God’s grace.libtech_918_footnotelibtech_919_footnoteHe works according to His law and, therefore, violence will also be stopped in accordance with that law. Man does not and can never know God’s law fully. Therefore we have to try as far as lies in our power. I hold that our experiment in non-violence has succeeded to a fair extent in India. There  is, therefore, no room for the passimism shown in the question. Finally ahimsa is one of the world’s great principles which no power on earth can wipe out. Thousands like myself may die in trying to vindicate the ideal but ahimsa will never die. And the gospel of ahimsa can be spread only through believers dying for the cause.

   KHADI  SCIENCE  SCHOOL  IN  BOMBAYlibtech_920_footnote  
 Shri Viththaldas Jerajani is one of those who will do his utmost to put into practice what he is once convinced is the right thing to do. When I returned home in 1915 from South Africa after 20 years’ exile, he was at that time running a large swadeshi store in Bombay. I explained to him that he was dealing in what was ‘swadeshi’ only in name. It was not difficult for him to understand that he had been
 
 labouring under a delusion but it was not clear to him what he should do. Beyond pointing out the flaw I too was unable to give him practical guidance straightaway. But I could not remain content without making efforts to put into practice what I believed. As soon as possible I threw myself heart and soul into producing khadi and Shri Viththaldas started business in khadi sales. At that time all the khadi that was produced was sold in Bombay. Khadi weavers in the production areas could be counted on the fingers of one hand. The history of the gradual growth of khadi is very interesting but I may not dwell on it here.
 Now that it has been realized that khadi merely as a commercial commodity has been a mistake, Shri Viththaldas has taken another step forward. I give below the gist of his account of his doings which he has described in a Gujarati letter to me :
 I have already informed you that two out of the original four Khadi Bhandars in Bombay have been converted into teaching centres. Instead of windows dressed with attractive khadi for purposes of sales, people are treated to look at all the implements of khadi production beginning from cotton right up to yarn. Those who are tempted to gain practical knowledge enter the showrooms and are given instruction should they so desire. Up till now there are 209 pupils and the attendance is fairly good for learning all the processes. Shri Kakubhai has taken up the work with zest and is devoting all his time to it.
 For weaving we could only get  one  place  in  Andheri where we have put up looms. Owing to the difficulty of pro- curing accommodation in Bombay, half the shop on  Kalba- devi Road has been turned into a weaving centre also. The services of an expert have been obtained. It remains to be seen how far we can progress in this line.
 During the war khadi sales mounted high owing to cloth shortage. Today also cloth for everyday needs is hard to get and other cloth has gone into the black market and fetches fantastic prices. Khadi is, therefore, still considered cheap and if it weren’t for the fact that yarn currency even to a limited extent is in vogue we simply could not have met the demand nor could have coped with the rush on our stores. The danger of khadi going into the black market might even have been there.
Politcal awakening has always connoted a pari passu
 increase in the demand for khadi and it is good that those who really believe in it and yet have been lazy about spinning will now have to take to the wheel. Conditions for teaching spinning are therefore favourable.
 There is nothing striking about the figures given by  Shri Jerajani. Those who think that the world is full of crazy people have every right to say that Bombay has its full quota of such folk. Men of faith believe that the world is the better for them. The man who strives for the impossible may be looked upon as a burden. But the crazy man who is possessed by some special idea is the crazy man who is prized by society. I place Shri Viththaldas in this category. To find even a few people in a pleasure-loving city like Bombay who realize the power of khadi is no small matter for satisfaction. Khadi will grow to its full height of course only when it is manufactured in every village and in every home and used there.
 Just as Bombay is the foremost city where giving money in charity is concerned, so it can play a leading part in the difficult task of producing khadi. Who would not like Bombay to hold this coveted position? Shri Viththaldas and his colleagues are working hard for this goal. If they die in the attempt to bring their dreams to fruition their death will be worth while. They must, however, hasten slowly in order to avoid mistakes. They must, however, hasten slowly in order to avoid mistakes. If they are watchful and mend their errors at once all will surely be well with their work.

 Khansaheb says that Akbar should go only when he wants to go. Khansaheb is of course convinced that Akbar can do better work in the Frontier Province. You will write to me when you go to Indore how things stand there. Then I can advise you further.
I have written to your about Borkamata, haven’t I?
 Akbar’s letters to me and Zohra are enclosed herewith. The envelope was addressed to Zohra. Inadvertently, my assistant here opened it. I read both the letters and gave them to Khansaheb to read. Now pass them on to Zohra.
        From 	a photostat of the Hindi : G. N. 514      INTERVIEW TO U. P. I.        As 	Mahatma Gandhi returned to his camp . . . after his 1libtech_927_footnote  Blessings 	from  BAPU        SIMLA,  May 	9, 1946  hours’ interview 
  with 	Sir Stafford Cripps, the United Press of India representative 	accosted him and asked for news relating to the latest development 	in the political situation. Gandhiji smilingly pointed to the 	weather outside and said :  	Don’t you see there is no more rain? The sky is clear of clouds 	and the storm which was raging has stopped.  The 	Bombay Chronicle, 	11-5-1946      SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING    SIMLA,  May 10, 1946libtech_928_footnote  Mahatma 	Gandhi congratulated the audience again on the perfect quiet they 	had maintained during the prayer hour. He hoped that they would be 	as disciplined wherever they went, whether for prayer or for any 	other gathering. If after leaving here they became disorderly, 	noisy, and quarrelled with each other, then their quiet, he said, 	was but a mockery.libtech_929_footnote  He 	told them that the spirit of prayer must abide with them all the 	twenty-four hours, if it was a heart prayer and came not merely from 	the lips. The real peace of prayer could come to their hearts only 	if God entered therein. Then they would be the     
 same outwardly as they were within. They would be honest, they would harbour no enmity against anyone, they would be truthful, they would cheat no one if they were in business.libtech_930_footnote
 Relating an incident of his youthful days, Mahatma Gandhi said how as a young man he had once gone into a small shop in Bombay and asked for a pen-knife. He was shown one priced at Re. 1-8. He thought Re. 1-8 was too much and bought the article at half that price. But on testing it, he found that it was not worth even a pice. He could not even sharpen his pencil with it.
If people are dishonest and chear others in this or in any other
way, they do not understand the meaning of prayer.
 Gandhiji said he would like more and more persons to come to the prayer gatherings but only if they came in the right spirit and with listening ears, so that they may live up to weather good they might take from the worship.
 It may take time for recitation to come from the heart even as a seed sown has to be nurtured and bears fruit only in due season. If the desire to have God within us is there, progress, however slow, is bound to be. Man cannot be transformed from bad to good overn- ight. God does not exercise magic. He too is within His own law. His law, however, is different from the law of the State. There may be mistakes in the latter but God cannot err. If He were to go beyond the limits of His law, the world would be lost. He is  changeless, unchanging, unequalled, the same yesterday, today and for ever. His law is written on the tablets of our hearts.
 They could become changed men and women, only if they had the desire of reform and if they were prepared for ceaseless endeavour.

        DEAR 	FRIEND,    LETTER TO LORD WAVELL    CHADWICK, 	  SIMLA WEST,  May 	11, 1946 
 I 	thank you for your letter of the 10th instant about salt.libtech_931_footnote  	This is a fine instance of how the irresponsible mind works. You 	were good enough to tell me last Mondaylibtech_932_footnotelibtech_933_footnotewhen 	I was silent that the British did not care for credit. When my 	silence was broken, the Cabinet Mission had come and we plunged into 	high politics. The

 In  my  opinion  the  noticelibtech_934_footnotelibtech_935_footnoteyou  have  been  good   enough   to send me  is  a  discreditable  affair.  The only  straight  answer  from my mind which thinks ever of the masses and is responsible and re- sponsive to them would be to abolish the hateful monopoly and tax especially in these days of famine. But according to you this simple act of justice must be left to be done by your  successor, the independent Government of India, whenever it comes into being.libtech_936_footnote

  	I have your long letter. It is difficult to give precise advice 	through communications. All I can say is that you should have a 	judicious fast under some medical observance, living when you feel 	really hungry on glucose-water with an ounce of juice of fresh 	limes, as often as your system requires it. Dates are 	contra-indicated. If you are able to take sufficient glucose you 	will sustain your strength and go through your work. Nothing else 	should be taken.

 I 	have your letter after many days. Were you busy or just lazy?  	You are again blaming me for your own lack of confidence. If you 	have grown wise and never cry, if you don’t care for what others 	say, who could stop you from coming here alone? Have you not 	yourself put the condition, “Who will teach me, and what?” If 	you have confidence in yourself, why need you ask that question? I 	do wish, of course, that Jaisukhlallibtech_937_footnoteshould be with you.  I understand your explanation. 	It is sad that Jaisukhlal should take this view. Why should a person 	dedicated to public service care for sweet or bitter experiences? It 	is enough if one’s heart is clean.  	You may now do what seems best to you. I got J.’s letter about 	rationing. I am thinking of forwarding it to Bhavangar.  	First send your annual report and then talk about a message. I am 	glad that both of you keep good health.

If, however, you think you can do better service in 	the Frontier Province, and if you have the courage, you should get 	ready to go there and that as early as possible. Do whatever is 	proper after taking into account all factors. What has happened to 	Mridulabehn’s idea of deputing somebody? Zohra 	has gone to Sevagram.    
 Amtussalaam was in Delhi but is now likely to have gone to Indore. Her brother Rashid Khan has expired.

    LETTER TO KRISHNACHANDRA      SIMLA, 
  May 	11, 1946  CHI. 	KRISHNACHANDRA,  	I have your letter about the theft. If you suspect Gopalarao take 	him aside and speak to him. It is certainly good to be independent 	of all servants but you will not be able to achieve it. After all we 	cannot carry on like this. The life of an ascetic is not for us. We 	try to approximate to it. Yes, it was a lapse on your part that you 	did not carry the key with you. To keep a cash-box and not to carry 	the key with you is as good as not keeping a cash-box. Hasn’t 	Bhartrihari written that the rich live in fear of being robbed? I do 	not like your idea of undertaking a fast. It is another thing if we 	undertake one for our own lapse. But a lapse can be counteracted not 	by undertaking a fast but by not repeating the lapse. Secondly, the 	one who undertakes  a fast in order to purify another who has 	committed a theft ought to be absolutely pure. There was no doubt 	negligence at the root of this incident. Find out what Kishorelal 	thinks about this. 
        From 	a photostat of the Hindi : G. N. 4554      SPEECH AT PRAYER MEETING    Blessings from  BAPU        SIMLA, 
  May 	11, 1946  Interpreting 	the bhajan sung 	by Sucheta Kripalani Gandhiji said :  	It is good to sing devotional songs in tune. But if we come to the 	prayers with the attraction of listening to good music alone we may 	overlook the meaning underlying the prayer. The best bhajan is 	one that is sung from the heart even if the style of singing is not 
 perfect.
 Today’s bhajan tells us that we are all citizens of the land in which there is neither sorrow nor suffering. You should not imag- ine  that  the  reference  is  to   heaven.  The  poet  himself  says   that  he is singing of the land in which we are living. This does not mean we have to wait for attaining perfection. Every one of us can create such a land within oneself if only one enthrones the God within. The world is after all made up of individuals. True, there are people of different races and colours, speaking different languages. How to live in such a world is exactly what the bhajan tells us. I do not know the composerlibtech_940_footnotelibtech_941_footnoteof this  bhajan  but I would advise those who have  been truly moved by it to make a copy of the bhajan not for singing but to translate its ideas into practice in their own lives.
 Those who come to attend prayers ought to carry something with them from here. Yesterday I was hurt to hear the noise created after prayers. It only means that my advice goes unheard. Such noise leads to scuffles and riots. Afterwards I felt that either I should stop speaking after prayers or the prayers should be conducted silently.
 Silent prayer is the best prayer. It is only through peace and calm that we can establish communion with God. It was only during my tours in Assam and Bengal that I started speaking after prayers. People ought to contribute generously for Harijans.
 Gandhiji asked people not to follow him to his residence for it hampered the task for which he had come there.
What is there to see in places which are all bound to perish. An
 earthquake may raze a palace to the ground whereas a hut may stand intact. You should remain calm even if others are restless. A person who has the strength of truth and non-violence, need not fear anyone. Peace and discipline alone can suppress unrest.

  May 	12, 1946  CHI. 	SUSHILA,  	I suppose I must count it a favour that you wrote to me after so 	many days. I understand about Durban. I  don’t think anything can 	be done about it.  	About marriage my views are definite. A girl must be allowed to 	study till she attains the age of 20. She may then be married when 	she feels the desire. If she wants to marry  earlier  and  has  	grown big enough for her age, we may help her. You many discuss the 	matter often with Sita and not marry her till she herself wishes to 	get married. The big mistake parents make is that they do not 	discuss this matter with their children. I think they should talk 	with them as with friends. It would be better if she draws no lesson 	from the experience       
 of your family. One must observe and think for oneself. Tarilibtech_944_footnoteis und- oubtedly a devoted worker. It is good that she keeps herself engrossed in that work.

  From 	a copy of the Hindi : Pyarelal Papers. Courtesy : Pyarelal      SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_951_footnote    May 	12, 1946  Referring 	to the spate of false rumours which filled the air, viz., that there 	had been a breakdown in the talks, that the Cabinet Mission were 	returning home without doing anything and Indian leaders would again 	return empty-handed as they did from the Simla Conferencelibtech_952_footnotelast time, Gandhiji 	said that this was not a conference like the one they had last year. 	If he understood the English language aright, the Cabinet Mission 	was here to find out how best they could implement their decision to 	quit, i.       
 e., remove their power from India. It was their duty, if they could, to try to bring about agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League. The Conference was being held for that purpose. If people were united, no power on earth could have ruled over them but the tragedy was that they had their differences. But even if the Conference failed in its purpose, no one need be disappointed. Those who have faith in God must be patient and brave. Supposing they were going to be deceived, they must stand up and face the consequences bravely. Gandhiji said he had no reason to believe that the Cabinet Mission was here to deceive them. They were trying to leave in an orderly manner so that Indians may be able to live in peace.  There was no need to worry. Man had to do his duty. God had given him strength and discernment to do so. But results were always in God’s hands.
 Last in their anxiety for their own future they  might  forget  their  duty  towards those whom they had condemned as the lowest of the sweepers’ quarters. The report which the latter brought him filled him (Gandhiji) with anger and grief. He  would  have   loved   to   go  there   himself.	Unfortunately he could not now negotiate hills and therefore could not walk so far to see them himself.  He thought   it a  crime to   sit   in   rickshaws   especially  for   an able-bodied  man.	He disliked even a motor car. He wanted always to use his legs, the  means  of  locomotion  that God had given him.  Last night he  walked,   but   the   hill   seemed  unending. It was impossible for him, much as he would have liked to do so, to live in the Harijan  Nivas  here.	He  had  heard  of  it  before  and  what  Badshah  Khan  told him confirmed it, namely,  that  the  quarters  in  which  they  were  forced  to  live were not fit for animals, much less for human beings. Some of them had been to see him in the morning with a long tale of woe. It was the bounden duty of the residents  of Simla to look into their grievances and have them redressed.
 He had heard too that the Khadi Bhandar at Simla might have to be closed down, because the Simla public were too lazy and too ununderstanding to spin the requisite quota of yarn. He told them that he still maintained that swaraj hung on the thread of hand-spun yarn. Even if they got political swaraj, as they were going to, they would never be able to maintain it without khadi which was the truest symbol of non-violence. If they hoped to maintain swaraj through force, they were hopelessly mistaken. Someone stronger would come and wrest their freedom from them. It was  in the hands of the public in Simla to keep the Bhandar going and he hoped they would do so. Punjabi women were the first to offer him yarn in the old days. Let them live up to their reputation. For himself, he would rather lose their money and close down every Bhandar, if need be, but swaraj never.

   A GOOD REMINDER  
 An anonymous friend has taken the trouble of collecting apposite extracts from the Book of Job and Psalms. As they are a perpetual reminder to all of us, I gladly give them below.libtech_953_footnotelibtech_954_footnoteThe moral I draw from the sheaf is that since man is only dust and at best grass, he had better pass the few moments he is on this earth in the service of his fellow creatures.

 SIMLA, May 13, 1946
 Harijan, 19-5-1946
 
   SLIGHTING  SWARAJ?libtech_955_footnote  
 Since the decision that khadi could only be purchased by giving a certain quota of yarn came into being, it has become very hard for a man like myself .
 . . to find the requisite time for spinning.  Nevertheless I have been spinning
 day and, therefore, went to the khadi Bhandar to buy some. I was asked by the Manager either to come to the Bhandar in order to make my own slivers or do the carding there and make the slivers at home. Now it is impossible for me with my very limited living space to slivers at home nor has a man like me the time to go and make them at the Bhandar. I said, “Either give me slivers or else I shall have to give up spinning.” I was told I was at liberty to do what I considered proper. . . .
The above letterlibtech_956_footnotelibtech_957_footnoterequires an answer.  The plight of the writer is
 the same as that of the many who live in the slums of Bombay. If our people were not so easily satisfied, the landlords of Bombay would not relegate poor families to one small living room each. Lakhs live in this way and thus make it possible for the rich to have their Malabar Hill and Chowpatty.
 The spinning-wheel shows us the way to remedy these conditions. If this were not so, it would have no place in my life. A few people may carve out their way by the sword, but the crores cannot. We must not imagine that slums do not exist in London, or
 
 Paris, or even New York. They do.
 What will be the condition in Russia it is too early yet to say.  What then about the writer’s difficulty?  He says he finds time to
spin 1libtech_958_footnotehours daily.   A  man  who  spins that much every  day can
 accumulate more yarn than necessary for his khadi needs. It was a mistake on his part to want to buy slivers from the Bhandar. The Manager gave him the correct reply. Where there is room  for spinning there is also  room  for  ‘ tunai’   (new carding method)  or ‘ punai’ (simpler than ‘tunai’). If there is no room for the wheel there is always the takli. The Dhanush takli too takes up less space. Whatever difficulties apply to the individual apply to all. The way to swaraj lies in not going under but in overcoming them. Necessity is the mother of invention.
 Again, why should not the facilities for carding, slivering and spinning offered by the Khadi Bhandar be utilized? The new method of making slivers does not require much space and is not difficult.
 The main requisite is for the spinner to have the faith that swaraj hangs on a thread of hand-spun yarn. It will not hurt the country’s cause if the man who lacks this faith gives up spinning. Khadi does enable many poor persons to earn their living by spinning and weaving. But this cannot do the work for the crores.

   VALMIKIS  OF  SIMLAlibtech_959_footnote  
 Readers must know that Valmiki is another word for Bhangi. Their living quarters in Simla are deplorable. No one bothers about them.  Rajkumarilibtech_960_footnotelibtech_961_footnotehas tried her best for them for years but how much can a single person do? I am unable to get as far and see things for myself, but I requested Badshah Khan who is staying with me to go there. He gives me a piteous account of their hovels. Some of the Valmikis have been to see me and have placed other  woeful complaints before me. I feel that if in the first instance their living quarters were rebuilt many of their other complaints too would be put right. It is the bounden duty of the public and the Municipality of Simla to remove this evil as soon as they can from their midst. They
 
 can be no cleaner than the least clean among them.

    SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_967_footnote      SIMLA, 
  May 	13, 1946  	Monday is the last day of my prayer gatherings in  Simla because I 	will be leaving for Delhi tomorrow. Yesterday I had told you that 	even if the Congress and the Muslim League failed to come to an 	agreement, it would not necessarily mean that all was over. After 	all, Hindus and Muslims are brothers. Some day they are certainly 	going to unite.,The British Cabinet Mission has  declared  their 	intention to withdraw British rule from India. It is my firm 	conviction that it should and will be withdrawn. There is no cause 	at all for us to despair. Freedom is our life’s breath and no 	other power can exercise that freedom on our behalf. We must, 	therefore, prepare ourselves for freedom. How we should do so, I 	have been telling you in the course of the talks here. So far we 	have been fighting for freedom with God as sustenance and support. 	Only with His help can we attain our freedom and preserve it.libtech_968_footnote         
 Mahatma Gandhi added he knew no other way. Nor had he the desire to know any other. He hoped the people would remain as peaceful and quiet as they had been during these prayer gatherings.

    SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_982_footnote      NEW 	DELHI, 
  [May 15, 1946]libtech_983_footnote  Echoing 	Badshah Khan’s word at 	the end of the prayers, 	Gandhiji said it was a 	travesty of 	true religion 	to consider 	one’s own 	religion as 	superior and 	others’ as 	inferior. All 	religions enjoined 	worship of the 	one God who was all-prevasive. 	He was present even in a drople of water or in a tiny speak of dust.  	Even those who worship idols, worship not the stone of which it is 	made; they try to see God who resides in it.  Similarly 	it was a libel to call the Paris fire-worshippers or 	sun-worshippers.       
 The Parsi hymn which Dr. Dinshaw Mehta had recited corresponded to the Gayatrilibtech_984_footnoteof the Hindus. It was nothing but puree worship of God. The various religion were like the leaves on a tree. No two leaves were alike, yet there was no antagonis between the branches on which they grew. Even so, there is an underlying unity in the varity which we see in God’s creation.
 Speculation as to the contents of the impending announcement of the Cabinet Mission had reached a feverish height with the return from Simla of the Mission and other members of the Tripartite Conference. Friends had been asking, remarked Gandhiji, as to what the message was likely to contain. He did not know, nor did he speculate. It was no use giving thought as to what it would contain. A man of prayer could not do otherwise. Good or bad, they would know all in another twenty-six hours. It would then be open to them to accept or reject it. Instead of looking outwards let them inward and ask God what their duty was in either event. For him and them in the meanwhile, it should be enough to know that Cabinet Delegation had come all the way leaving their hearth and home to find out in what manner British rule was to end and when the last British soldier was to leave India,  and not  whether or not to leave India. It was necessary for them to find out whether the Congress  and  the  Muslim  League  could  be  brought  together.  British  rule  had   separate them and if they (the Cabinet Mission) failed it was small wonder. They were bound to come together soon after the British hold on India had demonstrably ceased. The Cabinet Delegation’s concern was to quite India without a moment’s delay.
But supposing the reverse happens they will be the losers, not
 we. We have chosen the path of self-suffering. We rise through our suffering. That is nature’s law. He who clings to his sordid self or family interests loses. Man is sent into the world to perform his duty even at the cost of his life if necessary. We must therefore be braced for any suffering that may come in the performance of duty.
 All of us, Hindus and Mussalmans, constitute an integral whole. If someone errs all must suffer for it. God has so ordered this world that no one can keep his goodness or badness exclusively to himself. The whole world is like the human body with its various members. Pain in one member is felt in the whole body. Rot in one part must inevitably poison the whole system. Let us, therefore, cease to think in terms of individual and think in terms of the whole country. We must put faith in God and be careful for nothing. We hold our destiny in our own hands and no one but ourselves can make or mar it.

   SPEECH  AT   PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_1003_footnote  
 May 17, 1946libtech_1004_footnote
 Taking as his text the songlibtech_1005_footnotesung by Shrimati Sucheta Kripalani about “the land that was without sorrow and suffering,” Gandhiji proceeded to examine the Cabinet Mission’s pronouncement in the light of the ideal set forth in that song. How far was Cabinet Mission’s pronouncement calculated to enable them to realize that ideal?
The poet says we are citizens of a country in which there is
 neither sorrow nor suffering. Where is such a country to be found in this world? I confess, throughout my wandering I have not come across such a country so far. The poet has latter described the  condition for the attainment of that ideal state. It is easy to observe them individually. For one who really and truly is pure at heart, there  is no sorrow or suffering. but it is a difficult state for the millions to attain. Nevertheless we want India to be such a country.
 He  had  asked  them  on  the  previous  day  to  examine  independently   of other  people’s  opinions  the  statement  of  the  Cabinet Delegation   when   they saw it. They should examine it from the point of view of a country which would be without sorrow or suffering. He would give them his own reactions. He, however, did  not want to contradict himself by asking them to follow his ideas if they did not appeal to them. Everyone should think for himself and herself. They were to weigh opinions and adopt only those they had assimilated.
 He had glanced at the document casually on the previous night as soon as it was received. He had read it carefully in the morning. It was not an award. The Mission and the Viceroy had tried to bring the parties together but they could not bring about an agreement. So they had recommended to the country what in their opinion was worthy of acceptance by the Constituent Assembly. It was open to that body to vary it, reject it or improve upon it. There was no ‘take it or’ business about their recommendations. If there were restrictions, the Constituent Assemby would not be a sovereign body, free to frame a constitution of independence for India. Thus the Mission has suggested for the Centre certain subjecs. It was open to the Assembly by the majority vote of Muslims and non-Muslims separately, to add to them or even reduce them. And it was open to the Assembly to abolish the distiction which the Mission had felt forced to recognize. Similarly about grouping. The provinces were free to reject the very idea of grouping. No province could be forced against its will
 to belong to a group, even if the idea of grouping was accepted. He instanced only two things to illustrate this point. He had not exhausted the list of things which seemed to him to be open to objection or improvement.
 Subject to the above interpretation, which he held was right, he told them that the Mission had brought forth something of which they had every reason to be proud.
 There were some, he proceeded, who said the English were incapable of doing  the right thing. He did not agree with them. The Mission and the Viceroy were godfearing as they themselves claimed to be. It was beneath their dignity as men to doubt a person before he was proved to be untrue to his work.
The late Charlie Andrews was very inch of him an Englishman
 who had died slaving for India. It would be grievously wrong to doubt in advance every one of his contrymen.
 Whatever the wrong done to India by the British rule, if the statement of the Mission was geniune, as he believed it was, it was in discharge of an obligation which they had declared the British owed to India, namely, to get off India’s back. It contained the seed to convert this land of sorrow into one without sorrow and suffering.

   SPEECH  AT  PRAYER  MEETINGlibtech_1007_footnote  
 
 
NEW DELHI,
 
  May 	18, 1946  Pursuing 	the theme of the previous day’s songlibtech_1008_footnote, Gandhiji asked. . 	. how they were to convert India, which was today the home of sorrow 	and suffering into the ideal country about which the poet had sung. 	The reply he said was furnished by the song about the sermon of the 	trees which had just been sung.  	In tha song one is asked to take the lesson from the trees which 	themselves suffer the fierce rays of the sun and give shade to those 	who take shelter under them. To those who throw stones at them, they 	respond by  dropping  fruit.  That  is  true philanthropy.  To learn 	that philanthropy we are asked in that song to go to Harijan. Today 	society has condemned Harijans to a life of fifth and degradation. 	That is not their shame but our shame. Society has treated them as 	untouchables and condemned them to live in ghettos and yet they 	continue to render invaluable service to society for a mere 	pittance. It was open to them to take more lucrative avocations as 	some of them have done. The fact that vast majority of them have 	chosen not to, resounds to their credit.  If 	they could show that spirit of service in spite of their ignorance 	and backwardness, he asked, how much more spirit of selfless service 	and sacrifice ought the so-called savarna 	classes to show?  He 	had remarked in his previous day’s address that he saw the germs 	of the realization of the ideal envisaged by the poet in the song 	that had been sung on that day, in the announcement of the Cabinet 	Mission. But it was subject to the condition that it meant what it 	said. He likened that announcement to a promissory note, whose worth 	depended entirely on its genuineness and validity. If 	the promise inscribed on a promissory note is not honoured,  	the note is worth nothing and fit only to be torn to pieces and 	thrown away.  Truth 	meant everything to him. 	He had 	said that he would 	not purchase 	even swaraj 	at the cost 	of truth, 	because swaraj so 	purchased would be 	illusory. It 	was his hope 	and prayer, 	in which 	he invited 	the audience 	to join 	him, that the 	announcement  of the Cabinet Mission would be finally hounoured in letter and in spirit, and that God     
 would help the members of the Mission to discharge their promissory note even as He had done for His devotees in days of old.

 CHI. MANILAL,
 I have been meaning to write to you for many days, but could not. Today I have decided to dectate a letter. I am dictating this while having warm water and honey. I had a long discussion with Sorabjee. He broke down and cried. He says he can never have, has never had and will never have any share in doing you harm. He looks upon you as a blood-brother. He will, or course, see you. Do what you think best. He wishes that Omar Sheth’s son should be taken on the  Trust.libtech_1017_footnoteIf you agree, I have no objection at all. He is of the view that it will not look well if there is no Muslim on the Trust. His view does appeal to me. Show him the names which we had considered. I have an impression that you  had  suggested  Medh’slibtech_1018_footnotelibtech_1019_footnotename  and  that  I  had accepted it after some hesitation. Sorabjee says that it will produce a very good impression if his name is not included. He says that Medh’s having the spirit of service in him does not mean that he is qualified to be a trustee. Think calmly over this suggestion. Sorab must have left by now. The pressure of work is daily increasing here. The heat is sometimes bearable and sometimes unbearable.  The same is the condition of the mind.
 I hope Sushila is in good health. Sita, Arun and IIa must be fine. Sita’s [examination] result must be out. I am sure it is good.

 Sushila told me all about you. She said that it was highly desirable that you should go to some hill station for the sake of your health. I should of course be glad. It woud be good if you could do some such thing. Go to Panchgani or Almora or Mussoorie or Nainital or Abu. I think you can easily get accommodation in Abu. The air and water there are said to be good. I have had no experience of the place myself. I tell you what I have heard.
 I am very busy.  I am dictating this.  There you have to take up  a new task.

  May 	19, 1946  Gandhiji 	said that if they had carefully followed and assimilated Badshah 	Khan’s remarkslibtech_1021_footnotethey would know 	that the object of prayer was not to please God, who does not want 	our prayers or praise, but to purify ourselves.  	God is omnipresent. There is not an atom in the universe without His 	presence. The process of self-purificattion consists in a conscious 	realization of His presence within us. There is no strength greater 	than that which such realization gives.  It 	had pleased 	him to 	see so 	many of 	them coming 	to attend 	the prayers, 	he said. 	But it would hurt him if he found that  they had come just for fun, 	or, what would  be worse 	still, to 	hear his 	politicaal views. As 	a rule 	politics should not 	be permitted 	to intrude 	upon prayer. 	He, however, 	could not avoid 	referring to current 	political topics 	sometimes in 	the course 	of his 	after-prayer discourses 	because life could 	not be divided into water-tight compartments. Presence of God had to 	be felt in every walk of 	life. If 	they thought 	that as 	soon as 	they left the prayer 	ground they could 	live and behave 	anyhow, their 	attendance at 	the prayers 	was useless. 	If that 	interest in 	the prayers 	was genuine, 	the next 	day’s prayers, he 	hoped, would be 	as numerously 	attended as on the 	day he spoke, 	although he would 	not be 	speaking on 	account of 	his Monday silence.

I struggled 	hard to 	work without 	minding the calumniators 	but I 	give it 	up now. I 	have often 	asked myself 	the question 	: ‘Is 	it worth 	while?’ I 	feel it 	is not. I 	must yield to 	the longing 	of my heart 	not to 	be misunderstood. Why 	should I 	be thought to 	be seeking ‘power’ 	when it 	is not the case at 	all? I 	must prove 	it, although 	the proof 	is one 	that leaves 	no good 	behind but the mere proof.  Now 	that the urgent job of selections for the legislature is all over, 	let me leave the scene.  For 	my place 	(the University seat) there is 	Sambamurti available. He 	has not 	been given 	any seat nor did he 	apply. The 	position he 	has occupied 	in Andhra’s 	public life for 	over a 	quarter of 	a century, the 	unrivalled manner in 	which he 	fulfilled his 	duties as 	Speaker and 	his drive and 	energy are 	well-known, and 	it would be 	wrong to leave him out.

 VALLABHBHAI PATEL’S MESSAGE TO FOREIGN PRESSlibtech_1023_footnote
 BOMBAY,
 March 4, 1946
 Being a witness to the recent happenings in Bombay, I can say, nothing like it has happened within this generation. The destruction of property was wantonly thoughtless. There is no doubt that what happened was a direct outcome of the lessons of the war that has only officially closed, and an echo of what is happening in the West.
 The inequality which still seems to reign supreme and which it was hoped would die out, was galling for the Indian Ratings and resentment of distincion between Europeans and Indians made them impatient to the point of hurling what was bound to be a futile defiance on the part of an ill-armed few against overwhelming odds fully armed.
 The populace, whose sympathy has always been with the fighters against imperialism, readily joined hands and brushed aside the wise counsels of leaders who love liberty no less than they.
 It was not without the greatest difficulty that I persuaded the Ratings to surrender unconditionally, giving them at the same time the assurance that whatever was just in their cause would be championed by the Congress, that so far as was humanly possible, full justice would be done and that there  would  be  no victimization. I am only hoping that the authorities will not hark back to old, worn- out methods and senselessly insist on false prestige.
 Those who seek to uphold imperialism and perpetuate inequalities can ill afford to talk of prestige, much less of vindicating it in the present awakening and consequent determined opposition of which the recent events were convincing evidence.
 As a confirmed believer in the method of truth and non-violence adopted by the Congress for the past quarter of a century, I deplored the destruction of property, incendiarism, stopping of locomotives and insult and injury to whitemen, but they must not be used so as to postpone the declaration of independence even by a day.
 The national Congress will, of course, insist on the observance of truth and non-violent ways by the people but insistence on these ways will lie in the mouths of those who have constantly denied both or either in their dealings especially with exploited peoples such as those of India.
 We have been looking forward to the coming of the official Deputation and
 
 
 only hope that it is coming with the determined purpose of withdrawing British rule from all India and laying the foundations for a lasting friendship between Great Britain and India while there is yet a moment left. Let not history record that it was too late.

 SOUTH AFRICAN INDIAN DEPUTATION’S MEMORANDUM TO  THE  VICEROYlibtech_1024_footnote
      MAY IT PLEASE YOUR 	EXCELLENCY,  NEW 	 DELHI,  March 	12, 1946 
  We, 	 the  undersigned,  Sorabjee  Rustomjee, 	 Sooba  Rama 	 Naidoo,  Azum- shah   	Ahmed   Mirza    and   	Ahmed  Sadek 	  m.	kajee, 	delegates of the South 	African Indian Congress, 	duly appointed at its 	seventeenth session of 	the Conference 	held in 	Cape Town from the 8th to 	13th February, 	1946, together with 	members co- 	opted, being 	South African Indians 	at present 	in India, under authority 	of  the 	resolution of 	the Conference, 	respectfully beg to 	submit to 	you this statement 	on the 	proposed legislation, as 	announced by 	Field Marshal Smuts, in 	Union Parliament on 	21st January, 	1946, when he 	made known 	the intention 	of the 	Union Government to 	introduce legislation 	this session 	adversely affecting 	Indians in Natal and the 	Transvaal.  We are deeply grateful to Your Excellency for receiving us at short notice   in 	spite of your multifarious pre-occupations.   The 		present intention of 		the Government 		of the 		Union of 		South Africa 		will, if 		carried out, degrade us 		to a status of 		inferiority against 		which we have 		put up a fight 		more definitely 		since 1893, the 		year in which an attempt 		was made to disfranchise the 		Indian community as 		such in 		Natal. We 		then looked upon it 		as a slur not only on 		the Indians 		in Natal 		but also on 		the Mother 		Country. Then there 		was no 		Union of 		South Africa. The 		Cape had 		practically no 		Indian question worth 		the name. 		Orange Free State had 		banished the 		few Indian traders it 		had, and 		prided itself on 		its thorough 		anti-Asiatic policy. 		The Transvaal 		had a 		sprinkling of 		Indian traders, hawkers 		and others. 		The “location” 		system, later known as 		segregation, had 		its rise there. 		The whites 		in Natal 		had deliberately, 		and for their 		own sake, 		invited the large 		number of 		indentured Indians for 		their sugar and 		tea plantations and 		other industries. 		In their wake followed 		the traders 		and others, 		and the Indian 		population today 		is therefore 		a composite one. One would have thought that the advent of Union would mean the union of       
 all the races of South Africa, i. e., the African (the Bantu), the European and the Asiatics (primarily and principally Indians). What a noble tradition such a union would have been for the world! But it was not to be. On the contrary, the Union became an anti-African and anti-Asiatic combine. Every year of the progress of the Union has definitely marked the progress of this combine, and the strenuous opposition to it by the Indian settlers and their descendants, as will be clearly seen by reference to the Appendix A hereto attached.
  We 	ask Your Excellency 	to approach 	the question 	from that standpoint 	and no 	other. The 	threatened legislation 	adumbrated by Field 	Marshal Smuts, which has 	hastily brought the 	delegation from South 	Africa, is a very 	large step, perhaps the 	largest yet 	made, in 	the process 	of consigning 	the Asiatics 	to permanent 	inferiority. The 	wedge has 	now extended into 	all-round inequality and 	inferiority. Thus there 	are zones 	of segregation, 	one of which 	the whites 	are reserving 	for themselves 	in order 	to force 	by legal 	compulsion the 	segregation of 	the other races. God 	has made man 	“one great 	human family”. The white races of South Africa would make of it 	three separate parts 	based on colour.  Bad 	enough as 	the threatened land legislation 	is,  the 	 prospective franchise 	legislation is worse. 	It is a 	mockery of 	franchise and 	a poignant 	reminder  of 	the low status 	to be accorded 	to us—so 	low that we 	are not to 	be deemed even 	fit enough 	to choose 	one of our own as our representative.  We 	have come all 	the way from South Africa 	not to 	seek protection 	of individual 	or property 	rights, dear as 	both are, but 	we have 	come definitely to 	ask Your 	Excellency and 	the people of 	the Mother 	Country to 	appreciate the 	fight for 	equality of 	status, which 	is theirs 	as much 	as ours, 	and to 	give us 	as much help as 	possible for 	you and them to 	give. What is 	attempted to 	be done in 	South Africa is 	a denial of 	the brave 	declarations made 	by the 	British and 	even the Field Marshal 	himself.  It 	has given 	us much 	pleasure to 	learn that 	the withdrawal of 	the British 	power in 	India in 	favour of 	elected Indian 	representatives is 	imminent. Then may 	we ask 	whether it 	is not Your 	Excellency’s double 	and special 	duty to 	enunciate your 	stand in favour of equality and, so far as possible, enforce it in no uncertain terms?  The 	announcement of 	the intention of 	the Union Government to 	introduce legislation so 	alarmed the 	Indian community that the 	South African Indian 	Congress at 	its Conference aforesaid resolved to send a deputation to Field 	Marshal Smuts. This deputation 	made representations 	to him 	not to proceed 	with the intended 	legislation, and 	to convene a 	Round Table Conference of the Union 	Government and 	the Government 	of India 	in fulfilment 	of the recommendation 	of the Natal 	Indian Judicial 	Commission made 	in March 	1945. This request 	was refused 	by him, 	whereupon the 	Conference, after deliberating at great length, adopted the following resolution : 
 CAPE  TOWN,
 February  12, 1946
 This Conference of the South African Indian Congress, after having heard the report of the deputation that waited on the Prime Minister, expresses its grievous disappointment at his refusal to abandon the proposed legislation and to convene a Round Table Conference between India and South Africa.
 This conference interprets this refusal as the very negation of  the  principle of solving human problems by negotiations and mutual discussions and as indicating a legislative design of repressing the  community  and settling its fate at the altar of political expediency and sacrificing it to appease extreme white-reactionaries in this country. The legislation dealing with land tenure and communal representation to be introduced by the Prime Minister, which is totally unacceptable, is an insult to the national honour and dignity of the Indian nation.
 This  Conference  of  the  South   African   Indian   Congress,   having regard to the  Prime  Minister’s  refusal,  resolves  to  mobilize  all  the resources of the Indian people in this country in order to take every measure possible to secure the lapsing of the Pegging Act and to oppose the proposed legislation of the Government by :
  Sending 		a deputation to India :  
  to 	urge the 	Government of 	India for 	convening of 	a Round 	Table Conference 	between the Governments of India and South Africa;  failing 	which to request 	the Government 	of India 	(i) to 	withdraw the 	office of 	its High Commissioner 	in South 	Africa, (ii) to 	apply economic 	sanctions against South Africa;  to 	carry out 	a campaign 	of propaganda 	in India 	to secure 	the fullest 	support of 	India’s millions; to 	invite Indian leaders to come to South Africa. 
  Sending deputations to America, Britain and other parts of the world.  Proceeding 		immediately to prepare 		the Indian 		people of South 		Africa for 		a concerted 		and prolonged 		resistance, the details 		of which 		this Conference 		instructs its Executive 		to prepare 		for submission 		and action 		to its 		constituent bodies.   We 	would, therefore, ask 	Your Excellency to 	use your influence to 	secure the holding 	of a 	Round Table Conference 	between the two 	Governments to 	settle, in 	the words 	of the 	Natal Indian Judicial 	Commission, “all 	matters affecting Indians 	in South 	Africa”. But should 	your efforts in this 	connection unhappily fail, then we 	ask, in terms of our resolution herein before embodied, to withdraw the office of the High 
 
 Commissioner for India in the Union of South Africa and to enforce economic and political sanctions. We are not unaware that they may mean very little material loss to South Africa. We know that counter-measures will cause us hardship. But our loss we would count as nothing compared to the moral value of the enforcement of the sanctions.
 We have the honour to be,
 Your Excellency’s obedient servants,

  We 	offer you our allegiance—to you personally for your ideal and 	methods and  to you as the leader of the nation. We had liquidated the Jugantur Party and joined  the 	Congress without any party reservation. . . .  We 	started working honestly and sincerely; and our doubts and 	differences melted away particularly in view of the ever-developing 	policy of the Congress during the War. But we were arrested in May 	1941. Just after our arrest we had  some 	correspondence with 	you. You then wrote : 	“I have 	no difficulty 	in accepting 	your limitations 	of non-violence. 	If worked honestly, 	 it  will  automatically 	 expand.” Now 	we can say, we 	have no 	difficulty in 	accepting your 	non-violence—not only 	as the 	best means 	for achieving 	Indian revolution but 	also for 	saving the 	common man 	of the 	world as 	against the 	rising world 	Fascism based 	on naked violence. . 	. .  We 	have been working 	in and 	with the Congress 	since 1921—of 	course retaining 	a second 	love sometimes dormant 	and sometimes 	dominant. In 1938 	we outgrew 	that and made 	the Congress 	our only 	vehicle for serving 	the cause 	of Indian 	independence. Now 	we believe 	your method and programme 	is the 	only right way 	to be 	followed. . 	. .    
 We hope, the moment of the psychological break-away from the past world not be allowed to slip away and, under your inspiration and insistence, every effort would be directed to organizing the masses on the basis of your 18-point programme.
 After our release we shall be working with the outlook stated above. We shall try to stay with you for some time before we start work here. In our future work we shall seek your guidance and help. . . .
 Before  concluding  we  must  say  a  few   words   regarding   our   detention. The  Government  plea  of   terrorism   is   wholly   false.   Even   before   our   arrest, Sir  Nazimuddin,  then Home  Minister,  personally   told   us   his   police   reports had confirmed  his  personal  information  that we  were  doing nothing  but Congress  work.    This   was   barely   two   months   before   our   arrest.    In   1943, as Premier, he made almost the  same   statement  in   the   Assembly.   This   bogey of terrorism is simply a police trick—to serve a double purpose—to misrepresent us to the public and thus to create difficulties for work, and secondly to keep a broad hint that terrorist groups are still active so that guileless and sincere young men may be duped, and an atmosphere of terrorism kept up to serve imperialist purposes as against the Congress programme. There has been no case of terrorism in Bengal
 since 1934, and it is simply insulting our intelligence as well as our patriotism to say that we are thinking—or for that matter any other political group is thinking— of terrorism at this hour of the day.

 CLEMENT ATTLEE’S SPEECHlibtech_1026_footnote
 March 15, 1946
 I find from our friends in this House who had been out to India and returned, from letters received from Indians and from Englishmen in India of all points of view, complete agreement on the fact that India is today in a state of great tension and that this is indeed a critical moment. At the present moment the idea of nationalism is running very fast in India past to the present position. The temperature of 1946 is not the temperature of 1920, 1930 or even 1942. The slogans of earlier days are discarded. Sometimes words that seemed at that time to Indians to express the height
 
 of their aspirations are set on one side and other words and ideas thrust forward.
 I would like today, therefore, not to stress so much the differences between the Indians, but let us all realize that . . . there is this underlying demand among all the Indian people . . . . It is worth remembering . . . a nation of 40,00,000 people that twice sent her sons to die for freedom . . . should herself have freedom to decide her own destiny (cheers).
 My colleagues are going to India with the intention of using their utmost endeavours to help her to attain that freedom as speedily and fully as possible. What form of government is to replace the present regime is for India to decide, but our desire is to help her to set up forthwith a machinery for making that decision.
 There you have met with the initial difficulty of getting that machinery set up but we are resolved that a machinery shall be set up, and we seek the utmost co- operation of all Indian leaders to do so.
 India herself must choose as to what will be her future situation and her position in the world. Unity may come through the United Nations or through the Commonwealth but no great nation can stand alone by herself without sharing what is happening in the world. I hope that India may elect to remain within the British Commonwealth. I am certain that she will find great advantage in doing so, but if she does, she must do it of her own free will, for the British Commonwealth and Empire is not bound together by chains of external compulsion. It is a free association of free people.
 If, on the other hand, she elects for independence—and, in our view, she has a right to do so—it will be for us to help to make the transition as smooth and easy as possible. . . .
 We want to set up an Interim Government—one of the purposes of the Bill which has been discussed today—to give the Viceroy greater freedom in order that in the period which is to elapse while a Constitution is being worked out, you may have  a government enjoying the greatest possible support in India. I would not like to fetter the Viceroy’s decision in any way in regard to the choice of portfolios. . . .
 I am hoping that statesmen of Britain and of princely India will be able to work out a solution of the problem of bringing together the various constitutent parts. I do not believe for a moment that the Indian princes would lag behind in
 the forward march of India. . . .
 I am very well aware of the minority problem in India. I think all Indian leaders are realizing more and more that need for getting a settlement. and I believe
 that due provision will be made for them in the Constitution.
 With regard to the treaty, we are not going to hand out for anything for our own advantage which would be to the disavantage of India. . . .
 In the mass of Asia, an Asia ravaged by war, we have here the one country that has been seeking to apply the principles of democracy. I have always felt myself that political India might be the light of Asia. It is most unfortunate at the time when we have to deal with these great political issue . . . we have very grave anxiety over India’s food supply. . .
 Whatever we can do to assist, we shall do. My colleagues are going out to India resolved to succeed, and I am sure everyone will wish them Godspeed.

 CONGRESS WORKING COMMITTEE RESOLUTION ON SOUTH AFRICAlibtech_1028_footnote
 The Working Committee of the Indian National Congress are of opinion that the disabilities of the Indian settlers in South Africa constitute a blot on humanity and a slur on the civilization of the West. As the submission to His Excellency the Viceroy of the Indian deputation from South Africa shows, the disabilities are an unbroken tale of progressive prejudice against Asiatics defined as “any Turk and any member or a race or tribe whose national home is in Asia but which does not include any member of the Jewish or the Syrian race or a person belonging to the race or class known as the Cape Malay”, and of broken promises and declarations. A civilization that requires for its protection a series of legal enactments imposing political and economic restrictions on Coloured and Asiatic peoples must contain seeds of future wars and its own destruction.
 The Committee are of opinion that the contemplated breach of trade relations between India and the Union of South Africa is the mildest step that the Government of India could have taken. The Committee would ask the Government of India forthwith to withdraw their High Commissioner, if the Union Government would not suspend the proposed legislation, pending the convening of a Round  Table Conference between the two Governments to consider the whole policy of the Union Government against non-white peoples of the earth.
 The Committee are painfully surprised to find Field Marshal Smuts, the
 
 Premier of the Union, dismissing, on the untenable plea of regarding the proposed anti-Asiatic Bill as a domestic affair, the right of the Indian Government and, by parity of reasoning, of the other Allied Powers of friendly intervention. The Committee hold that at this time of the day it is not open to any State, however powerful it may be, to refuse to listen to the public opinion of the world as voiced through its different States with reference to any legislation regarded by them as of an inhuman character or as amounting to a slur on the self-respect of  the  races  comprising such a State.
 The Committee venture to advise the victorious Allies to take notice of the contemplated action of the Government of South Africa inasmuch as the late war would have been fought in vain, if now the persistence by the Union Government of South Africa in the bar sinister against Asiatic races and Coloured people inhabiting that sub-continent is maintained.
 To the Indian Deputation from South Africa the Committee would say that whilst they (the Committee) and, indeed, the whole of India, irrespective of parties or communities, are with them in their just struggle and would lend them all the moral weight they can, they should realize that the brunt of the unequal struggle will have to be borne by them, and the Committee feel assured that the Indians in South Africa will worthily carry out the example set by them years ago of vindicating their self-respect and that of the Motherland by the noble rule of self-suffering.
 The Committee would, however, fain hope, even at the eleventh hour, that in
 the place of the indefensible law of the jungle, which the policy as revealed by the contemplated legislation enunciates, the Government of the Union of South Africa and its white settlers would listen to reason and the appeal of the moral law by which mankind lives.

 VICEROY’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW TO GANDHIJIlibtech_1029_footnote
 April 3, 1946 I  thought  the  interview  with  Gandhi,  naked  except  for   a dhoti   and looking remarkably healthy, was rather a deplorable affair. The Secretary of State
 began with his usual sloppy benevolence to this malevolent old politician, who for
 all his sanctimonious talks has, I am sure, very little softness in his composition. He began with the demand for the abolition of the salt tax, which he led up to by a lot   of rather hypocritical sob-stuff. (In the five yeas I have been in the Government of India, I have never heard from anyone but Gandhi a suggestion that the salt tax was really oppressive, and it brings in nine crores; but Gandhi wants it be removed
 
 
 as a sop to his vanity, because he went to prison over it 15 years ago.)libtech_1030_footnoteHe rambled on in his usual rather  vague  way,  approaching  the  Pakistan  issue,  by   the   way  of his drunken son who had become Muslim for a while in the hope that it would cure him of drink; spoke of his efforts to meet Jinnah by Rajagopalachari’s formula, and his Bombay talks; and finished with the meant-to-be plausible proposal that Jinnah should be asked to form a Ministry—the catch being that he would be subject to the Hindu majority in the Central Assembly (I had heard this idea put forward before). As usual Gandhi refused to be pinned down to details.  The interview closed by a little speech of Secretary of State expressing ‘penitence’ for Britain’s misdeeds in the past !

 APPENDIX IX
 NOTE ON INTERVIEW TO CABINET MISSIONlibtech_1031_footnote
 Secret	April 3, 1946, 4 p.m.
 The Secretary of State said that what the Delegation would like best would be to have Mr. Gandhi’s advice as to what he would like to see happen, especially in regard to the position as regards the Muslim League. Mr. Gandhi said that he would rather such a question should be put to the authorized representatives of the Congress. He had come, in reply to the invitation sent to him, to help and not to hinder and what he was most anxious about was that there should be the right atmosphere. He had asked in writing for certain action which would let the people feel that independence was coming.
 The Cabinet Delegation would have a much greater measure of difficulty to contend with than any other mission to India. If they meant business, he would advise them to take action which would produce a hearty friendship. This could not be done without the release of the prisoners now in British custody. The flowers of the Indian nation were in prison—whether they were violent or non-violent did not matter, but if the Delegation was sincere, it was bound to release them. Jayaprakash Narayan was one of India’s most learned men. For the same reasons, the salt tax should be removed.  Salt  should  be  free  for  the  poor  man. The  humanitarian clause introduced by Lord Halifax as a result of Mr. Gandhi’s movement in
 
 1930  had  worked  well  in  some  places.   But   whatever   the   legal   difficulties were,  the  tax  could  be  removed,   and  a  message   of   independence   be   brought   to  every  village  in  India.  He  was  very  sorry,  he  had  received   a  letter   from   Mr.  Abell  saying  this  could  not  be  done.   It  had   been   written,   if   he   might say so, unthinkingly. Much taxation had been introduced by the Viceroy for war purposes, and he could as easily remove this salt tax.
 Mr. Gandhi said that he had passed 18 days with Mr. Jinnah.  He claimed to be a sincere friend of the Muslims, but had never been able to appreciate the Pakistan which Mr. Jinnah says he means. Mr. Jinnah had never in concrete terms given a definition of Pakistan. His Pakistan was a sin which he (Mr. Gandhi) would not commit. The substance of Pakistan as he understood it was independence of culture and a legitimate ambition. In Rajagopalachari’s Formula he (Mr. Gandhi) had given concrete shape to a proposal to meet this demand. He differed from Rajagopalachari, but when the latter produced his Formula, he was on his last legs and said that he accepted it.
 If this was what Mr. Jinnah meant, he accepted it and did so in writing. Mr. Gandhi’s conception of Pakistan is there in concrete form. If that were put into shape and all the snags removed, it was to form the basis for negotiations and, unless he was reasoned into it, he could not go further because beyond that Pakistan is an untruth.
 The two-nation theory is far more dangerous. The Muslim population is a population of converts—only a microscopic minority are not. They are all descendants of India-born people. Jinnah is sincere but his logic is utterly at fault especially as a kind of mania possesses him. He himself was called a maniac and he, therefore, honoured Jinnah for his mania. In 18 days Mr. Gandhij failed to be convinced of this two-nation theory. He asked Jinnah whether his own son who had gone over to the Muslim religion changed his nationality by doing so. Mr. Gandhi’s Formula did not solve the difficulty unless we could get agreement. But why should the Delegation worry ? They must lie on the bed they had prepared and this situation  is a legacy of British rule. Wrong does not become right to give it another lease of life. If you have undone the past, you must write on a clean slate and cannot have two nations or two Constitution-making Bodies. The difficulty would not be solved if the Muslim League refused to join the Constitution-making Body. After  having  exhausted all friendly resources, if you feel a stage must arrive when you feel you must say that there shall only be one Constitution-making Body, you must take the risks of that. There must be a considerable interim period. What is to happen in the period and what is to happen to your promise? Let Mr. Jinnah form the first Government and choose its personnel from elected representatives in the country. The Viceroy would appoint them formally but, in fact, Mr. Jinnah would choose. If he does not do so,
 then the offer to form a Government should be made to Congress. After all, it is no light responsibility. The food situation is most serious, and you will not be able to deal with this famine without producing a psychological effect on the people. The best administrative organization will not help without this.
 Mr. Gandhi said, in reply to questions, that there were two formulae of his, one by Mr. Rajagolapalchari and the other in his correspondence with Mr. Jinnah which had been published. The Interim Government must be absolutely national. Mr. Jinnah could choose who he liked for his Government. They would be subject to the vote of the Assembly from which they were drawn. He would not mind the Council beign responsible to Lord Wavell, if there were honest conventions. The Secretary of State said that, of course, Mr. Jinnah in existing circumstances had not got a majority in most of the Legislatures. If he had to choose Ministers to be responsible to Provincial Legislatures, most of them would have to be drawn from parties other than his own. Mr. Gandhi said, it was inescapable that the Congress had a majority in most of the Legislatures. His idea was that the members chosen from the Provincial Legislatures would be transferred to the Central Legislature, places being made for them by arranged resignations. They would then be responsible to the Central Legislature. The secretary of State said that, even so, the Legislature would be, of course, very predominantly Hindu. If Mr. Jinnah were not prepared to form a Legislature on this basis, the Congress could be called upon to do so.
 Mr. Gandhi said, he did not underrate the difficulties of the situation which the Delegation had to face. If he were not an irrepressible optimist, he would despair of any solution.

 VICEROY’S NOTE ON INTERVIEW TO GANDHIJIlibtech_1032_footnote
 Tuesday, April 9, 1946
 In the afternoon, Gandhi came to see me about the salt tax.   He professed   to be coming purely as a  friend of Britain, so that the British would get the credit  of  removing  this  unjust  tax  before  the  National  Government  came  into  power and did so. The old humbug, I wonder whether he suspects that  a  National Government would do nothing of the sort and that the British are easier to bounce.   I refused, naturally, to commit myself in any way, and merely said, I would look into the matter. (He had sent Amrit Kaur to see Q. and try to influence her in helping bounce  me.)  He  then  asked  for  the  release  of  Jayaprakash Narayan, whose wife is apparently one of his followers (‘adopted daughter’, he called her).
 
 I did not commit myself, though I expect we shall have to release him shortly. Gandhi then started on the I.N..A. and I told him exactly what the I.N.A. were—  the weaklings and cowards of those captured in Malaya—and what folly it  had been for Congress to make heroes of such men and to neglect those who had remained true in spite of starvation, ill-treatment and torture. When we parted, I gave him a warning that the threat of mass movement by Congress was a dangerous weapon, there were still a great many thousand British soldiers in India who did not subscribe to his doctrine of non-violence, and might be very violent, if British lives or property suffered. He took this with a grin, and was very friendly throughout.

 APPENDIX XI
 LETTER FROM G. RAMACHANDRA RAOlibtech_1033_footnote
 I and my co-workers have been trying this method of residing and eating with the Harijans for the last five or six years. Our experience proves that it is an efficient method to remove the social isolation of the untouchables. But our work is spreading slowly. If a man like Bapuji took it up, as he did at Bombay, it is bound to gain wide publicity and attract more workers to the method.
 In this connection, another suggestion might be considered. Side by side with the mixing up, an attempt also might be made to discourage the use of labels of caste and creed which raise imaginary barriers between man and man.  Not only should  the practice of untouchability  go,  but  the  Harijan  should  not  be  allowed  to continue a Harijan; he should be united with the general  stream  of  humanity.  Similarly the Hindu and Muslim differences might be solved by  discarding  the  labels.  Such an attempt will  no  longer  keep  the  form  of   communal   harmony, but it would lead to the growth of one humanity. Communal harmony presupposes the existence of communities. In one humanity no communities exist. Though a powerful personality like  Gandhiji  might  harmonize  communities  for  a  while, when the personal influence weakened, the communities would clash again. So a permanent solution of communal differences is the growth of one-humanity outlook rather than communal harmony.
 The growth of one-humanity requires the rejection of communal labels. Perhaps even the rejection of the labels of religion would involve a change of the belief in god, for every denominational label is associated with faith in a particular form of god. But, though every religion talked only of one god, in practice, however, belief in god always deteriorated into sectarianism and fanaticism because god is a falsehood. So atheism is the most suitable attitude for the establishment of one humanity.
 
 
 In order to set up happy human relations, communal harmony is the utmost limit to which the theistic mind can be stretched inasmuch as belief in god has to be somehow preserved. But communal harmony is beset with definite drawbacks; so the desirability of atheism as the best means to establish one humanity and thereby to lay strong foundations for permanent peace in human relations might be considered.

 WOODROW WYATT’S NOTE ON DISCUSSION WITH GANDHIJIlibtech_1034_footnote
  He 	thinks that 	the Cabinet 	Mission has come 	with the intention of 	getting off 	India’s back. Their 	function here is 	to devise a 	means of 	doing it 	gently. He 	agreed that it 	should also be 	their function 	to precipitate 	a situation 	in which 	Indians must decide the 	future structure of India themselves.  It 	would be 	wrong, if 	the three 	Cabinet Ministers were 	to imagine 	that they 	could arrive at a just 	and fair 	solution of India’s 	problems. They cannot, and 	it is not 	their affair.  If 	the British 	were to make a decision, 	and impose 	it, it would be 	overturned as 	soon as 	they had gone.  Pakistan 	is a British 	creation. (Incidentally, so 	is the famine.) 	He agreed that 	it would 	be much 	better for Congress 	to concede 	Pakistan than for the 	British. If 	Congress conceded it, 	it would be 	something much more glorious.  He 	thinks there may 	well have to be a 	blood-bath in 	India before her 	problems are 	solved. He 	would urge 	non-violence on 	Congress but 	does not expect them to 	observe it. 	The only thing he 	expects from 	Congress in 	the event 	of civil 	war is that 	they will fight decently and 	take one 	tooth for 	one tooth, and 	not a hundred teeth for 	one tooth as 	the British do.  The 	Interim Government 	should be 	formed on 	the basis 	of the 	Central Legislature; 	members of the 	Central Legislature 	should nominate the 	members of 	the Executive 	Council. Nominated members of 	the official 	block must be left 	out of 	the picture. 	If the 	Central Legislature 	nominated people who were 	not members of 	the Central Legislature, 	then seats would have to 	be found for them in the 	Central Legislature.  He 	would urge on 	Congress that they should 	offer seats on the 	Executive Council 	to the Muslim League.,  If 	the British 	do not 	wish to 	accept the 	nominations of 	Congress, then 	they should accept the 	nominations of 	the Muslim 	League. He would then 	tell Congress 	that they must play fair with the 	Muslim League. 
 
  He 	agrees that 	it might 	well be unfair 	for the British 	to form 	an Interim 	Government and not give it its support. They should certainly advise it in any case.  He 	thinks it would be reasonable to announce that after a certain date 	there will be 	no British 	support for 	the Interim Government so 	forcing the 	Interim Government 	to solve 	India’s internal problems before that date.

 WINSTON CHURCHILL’S SPEECHlibtech_1035_footnote
 The world is very ill. This is the time when hatred is rife in the world and when many mighty branches of the human family, victors or vanquished, innocent or guilty, are plunged in bewilderment, distress or ruin. Two fearful wars in our lifetime have torn the heart out of its grace and culture.
 Measureless injury has been done to much that the 19th century would have called ‘Christian civilization’, for all the leading nations have been racked  by stresses which have blunted their sensibilities and have destroyed their agreeable modes of social intercourse.
 Only science has rolled forward, whipped by the fierce winds of mortal war, and science has placed in the hands of men agencies of destruction far beyond any development of their commonsense or virtue.
 In a world where over-production of food was formerly from time to time a problem, famine has laid its gaunt fingers upon the peoples of many lands and scarcity upon all.
 The psychic energies of mankind have been exhausted by the tribulations through which they have passed and are still passing. It is not only bloodletting that has weakened and whitened us.
 The vital springs of human inspiration are, for the moment, drained. There must be a period of recovery. Mankind cannot, in its present plight bear new shocks and quarrels without taking to altogether cruder and primordial forms.
 Yet we do not know that the hatred and confusion which are found will not confront us with even harder trial than those we have so narrowly and painfully survived.
 In many countries, where even united efforts would fall short of what is needed, party strife and faction is fomented or machine-made and skeleton fanatics rave at each other about their rival ideologies.
 All the while, the ordinary folk of every country show themselves kindly and
 
 
 brave and serviceable to their fellow men. Yet, they are driven against one another  by forces and organizations and doctrines as wantonly and remorselessly as they ever were in the ages of absolute emperors and kings.
 There never was a time when breathing space was more needed, a blessed convalescence, a truce of God and man.

 SUGGESTED POINTS FOR AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CONGRESS AND THE MUSLIM LEAGUElibtech_1036_footnote
  There 	shall be an All-India 	Union Government 	and Legislature 	dealing with 	Foreign Affairs, Defence, Communications, Fundamental Rights and 	having the 	necessary powers to obtain for itself the finances it requires for these subjects. All 	the remaining powers 	shall vest in the provinces.  Groups 	of provinces 	may be 	formed and 	such Groups may 	determine the 	provincial subjects which 	they desire to take 	in 	common. The Groups may set up their own Executives and Legislatures.  The 	Legislature of 	the Union shall be 	composed of 	equal proportions from 	the Muslim-majority 	provinces and from 	the Hindu-majority 	provinces whether or not 	these or 	any of them have formed themselves 	into Groups, 	together with 	representatives of 	the States.  The 	Government of 	the Union 	shall be constituted 	in the 	same proportion 	as the Legislature.  The 	constitutions of 	the Union 	and the Groups 	(if any) 	shall contain a provision 	whereby any province 	can by 	a majority 	vote of 	its Legislative 	Assembly call 	for a 	reconsideration of 	the terms 	of the 	constitution after an 	initial period of 	ten years 	and at ten yearly 	intervals thereafter. 
 For the purpose of such reconsideration a body shall be constituted on the same basis as the original Constituent Assembly and with the same provisions as to voting and shall have power to amend the constitution in any way decided upon.
  The 	constitution-making 	machinery to arrive 	at a 	constitution on 	the above 	basis, shall be as 	follows :   Representatives 		shall be 		elected from each Provincial 		Assembly in 		proportion to 		the strength 		of the 		various parties in 		that Assembly 		on the 		basis of 		1/10th of 		their numbers.  Representatives 		shall be 		invited from 		the States on 		the basis 		of their 		population in 		proportion to 		the representation 		from British India.  
 
   The 		Constituent Assembly so 		formed shall meet 		at the earliest date 		possible in 		New Delhi.  After 		its preliminary 		meeting at which 		the general 		order of business 		will be 		settled, it 		will divide 		into three 		sections, one 		section representing 		the Hindu- 		majority provinces, one 		section representing the 		Muslim-majority 		provinces and one 		representing the States.  The 		first two 		sections will 		then meet separately to 		decide the 		provincial constitutions for their Groups and, if they wish, a Group constitution.  When 		these have settled it 		will be 		open to 		any province 		to decide 		to opt 		out of its original Group and go into the other Group or to remain outside any Group.  Thereafter 		the three 		bodies will meet together 		to settle 		the constitution 		for the union on the lines agreed in paragraphs 1-7 above.  No 		major point in 		the Union 		constitution which 		affects the communal 		issue shall be 		deemed to 		be passed by 		the Assembly unless a 		majority of 		both the 		two major communities 		vote in its favour.

 TALK WITH HORACE G. ALEXANDER AND AGATHA HARRISONlibtech_1037_footnote
 Strictly confidential	May 7, 1946
 [G.] Two sides to talk—may be a favourable side but whole of talk left unfavourable impression on me.
 Idea is at any cost to please Jinnah—struggled hard to show this not proper
 thing.
 An attempt to prevent civil war—and civil war at any cost. “We want to
 prevent civil war coming”—but this can’t be prevented if hearts are not together.
 Just now something should be imposed is thought.
 Hatred is rampant—I have done the utmost in inducing faith—even if one is not inclined to believe the evidence. Hold that nothing is lost by this belief—in spite of all that is said “I told you so”, etc.
 He recounted steps taken to bring conference—Pethick-Lawrence’s 27th letter and the replies of Azad and Jinnah. The formula was only to “start discussion”.
 Asked by Horace Alexander, “What did you advice?” Gandhiji said, “Don’t
 
 think of an award.” Patel had reminded him that Attlee had definitely stated there would be no such thing. He had advised them to pick up one party in which they believed and persuade them whichever party had the  greater justice and rightness on  its side; then they should deliver the goods and say, ‘We trust you with power.’ This might be the Muslim League. If justice and right not on the Muslim League side then deliver the goods to the major party.
 Here the Sardar said he did not know how they would prevent civil war by this method. “They seem to have come to an agreement with Jinnah to do anything to placate him. We took Attlee’s speech [in good faith] otherwise we should not have come.”
 Gandhiji said that a better interpretation was they did not want to impose a formula—that they sincerely believed that Jinnah had come round. Patel said they were impressed with fact that Jinnah could create trouble. In effect they were saying, ‘If you want to avoid civil war—you must agree’. This was an incitement.
 Gandhiji said the Ministers admitted that they had sinned and that because of this they were here. Gandhiji said he felt this should be publicly stated.
 Regarding what Horace and I should do Gandhiji said, “Watch and pray”; that it would be dangerous to build on his account of the talk last night that his conversations were based on a fear. Therefore for us to act on the account he had given would be wrong. He had challenged them and they were sending along [sic].

Strong representations have 	been received from 	the Bombay salt 	merchants and Shilotries 	Association on the subject.

Though Cripps and Secretary of State kept at Gandhi for an hour, till 9 p. m., they quite failed to move him.

 STATEMENT OF CABINET DELEGATION AND VICEROYlibtech_1041_footnote
 May 16, 1946
   On 		march 15th 		last just before the 		despatch of 		the Cabinet 		Delegation to India, 		Mr. Attlee, 		the British 		Prime Minister, used these words :  
 “My colleagues are going to India with the intention of using their utmost endeavours to help her to attain her freedom as speedily and fully as possible. What form of Government is to replace the present regime is for India to decide; but our desire is to help her to set up forthwith the machinery for making that decision.       I
 hope that India and her people may elect to remain within the British Commonwealth.  I am certain that they will find great advantages in doing so.	But
 if she does so elect, it must be by her own free will. The British Commonwealth and Empire is not bound together by chains of external compulsion. It is a  free  association of free peoples. If, on the other hand, she elects for independence, in our view she has a right to do so. It will be for us to make the transition as smooth and easy as possible.”
   Charged 		in these historic 		words we—the Cabinet 		Ministers and 		the Viceroy—have 		done our utmost 		to assist 		the two main political 		parties to 		reach agreement 		upon the 		fundamental issue 		of the 		unity or 		division of 		India. After prolonged 		discussions in New 		Delhi we 		succeeded in 		bringing the 		Congress and 		the Muslim 		League together in 		Conference at 		Simla. There was 		a full exchange of 		views and both parties 		were prepared 		to make 		considerable concessions 		in order 		to try 		and reach 		a settlement 		but it 		ultimately proved 		impossible to close 		the remainder of 		the gap 		between the 		parties and 		so no agreement could be 		concluded. Since no 		agreement has 		been reached we feel that it is our duty to put forward what we 		consider are the best arrangements 		possible to ensure 		a speedy 		setting up of the 		new Constitution. This 		statement is 		made with the 		full approval of 		His Majesty’s 		Government in the 		United Kingdom.  We 		 have  accordingly   		decided   that 		  immediate   		arrangements   should 		be  made  whereby   Indians 		  may   decide   the   		future   Constitution   		of   India   and 		an  Interim 		 Government  may  be  		set  up  at   once   to   carry   on   the   administra- tion 		 of  British 		 India  until such  time  as  a  new  		Constitution   can 		  be   brought into 		being. We 		have endeavoured 		 to  be  just  to  the  smaller 		 as  well  as  to  the  		larger  sections  of 		 the  people;  and 		 to   recommend   a  solution 		  which   will   lead 		  to a practicable 		way of 		governing the 		India of 		the future, 		and will 		give a sound 		basis for 		defence and 		a good 		opportunity for progress 		in the 		social, political and 		economic field. It is not intended in this Statement to review the voluminous evidence  
 
 that has been submitted to the Mission; but it is right that we should state that it has shown an almost universal desire, outside the supporters of the Muslim League, for the unity of India.
   This 		consideration did not, 		however, deter us from 		examining closely and 		impartially the 		possibility of 		a partition of 		India; since we 		were greatly impressed 		by the 		very genuine and 		acute anxiety of 		the Muslims 		lest they should 		find themselves 		subjected to a perpetual 		Hindu-majority rule.  
 This feeling has become so strong and widespread amongst the Muslims that it cannot be allayed by mere paper safeguards. If there is to be internal peace in India it must be secured by measures which will assure to the Muslims a control in all matters vital to their culture, religion, and economic or other interests.
   We 		therefore examined in 		the first instance the 		question of 		a separate and 		fully independent 		sovereign State of Pakistan as claimed by the Muslim League.   Such 		  a Pakistan would 		comprise two 		areas; one in the north-west 		consisting of 		the Provinces 		of the 		Punjab, Sind, North-West 		Frontier, and British 		Baluchistan; the 		other in 		the north-east 		consisting of the 		Provinces of 		Bengal and 		Assam. The 		League were prepared 		to consider 		adjustment of boundaries 		at a 		later stage, but 		insisted that 		the principle 		of Pakistan 		should first be 		acknowledged. The 		argument for 		a separate 		State of 		Pakistan was 		based first, upon the 		right of 		the Muslim 		majority to 		decide their 		method of Government 		according to their 		wishes, and 		secondly, upon 		the necessity 		to include 		substantial areas in 		which Muslims are 		in a minority, 		in order 		to make 		Pakistan administratively and 		economically workable.  
 The size of the non-Muslim minorities in a Pakistan comprising the whole of the six Provinces enumerated above would be very considerable as the following figureslibtech_1042_footnoteshow :

 The Muslim minorities in the remainder of British India number some 20 million dispersed amongst a total population of 188 million.
 These figures show that the setting up of a separate sovereign State  of  Pakistan on the lines claimed by the Muslim League, would not solve the communal minority problem; nor can we see any justification for including within a sovereign Pakistan those districts of the Punjab and of Bengal and Assam in which the population is predominantly non-Muslim. Every argument that can be used in favour  of Pakistan, can equally in our view be used in favour of the exclusion of the non- Muslim areas from Pakistan. This point would particularly affect the position of the Sikhs.
   We 		therefore considered 		whether a smaller 		sovereign Pakistan confined to 		the Muslim 		majority areas alone 		might be a 		possible basis 		of compromise. 		Such a 		Pakistan is 		regarded by 		the Muslim 		League as quite 		impracticable because it 		would entail 		the exclusion 		from Pakistan 		of (a) 		the whole of 		the Ambala 		and Jullundur 		Division in 		the Punjab; (b) 		the whole of 		Assam except the 		District of 		Sylhet; and 		(c) a large part of Western Bengal, including Calcutta, in which city the Muslims form  
 23.6 per cent of the population. We ourselves are also convinced that any solution which involves a radical partition of the Punjab and Bengal, as this would do, would be contrary to the wishes interests of a very large proportion of the inhabitants of these Provinces. Bengal and the Punjab each has its own common language and a long history and tradition. Moreover, any division of the Punjab would of necessity divide the Sikhs leaving substantial bodies of Sikhs on both sides of the boundary. We have therefore been forced to the conclusion that neither a larger nor a smaller sovereign State of Pakistan would provide an acceptable solution for the communal problem.
   Apart 		from the great 		force of the 		foregoing arguments 		there are weighty 		administrative, economic 		and military 		considerations. The 		whole  of  the 		transportation and 		postal and 		telegraph systems of 		India have been 		established on the 		basis of 		a united India. To 		disintegrate them would 		gravely injure both parts of 		India. The 		case for a united 		defence is even 		stronger. The 		Indian armed 		forces have 		been built 		up as a whole for the defence of India as a whole, and to break 		them in two would inflict a deadly blow on the long traditions and high degree of efficiency of the Indian  
 
 Army and would entail the gravest dangers. The Indian Navy and Indian Air Force would become much less effective. The two sections of the suggested Pakistan contain the two most vulnerable frontiers in India and for a successful defence in depth the area of Pakistan would be insufficient.
   A 		further consideration of 		importance is 		the greater 		difficulty which the 		Indian States would find 		in associating 		themselves with divided British India.  Finally 		there is the 		geographical fact 		that the two halves of 		the proposed 		Pakistan State are 		separated by 		some seven hundred 		miles and the 		communications between 		them both in 		war and peace would be dependent on the  goodwill 		 of Hindustan.  We 		are therefore 		unable to advise 		the British 		Government that the 		power which 		at present 		resides in British 		hands should be handed 		over to 		two entirely 		separate sovereign States.  This 		decision does 		not however 		blind us 		to the very real Muslim apprehensions 		that their culture and 		political and 		social life might become 		submerged in a 		purely unitary 		India, in 		which the 		Hindus with their 		greatly superior numbers 		must be 		a dominating element. To 		meet this the 		Congress have put 		forward a 		scheme under 		which Provinces would 		have full autonomy 		subject only to 		a minimum of Central 		subjects, such as 		Foreign Affairs, Defence 		and Communications.  
 Under this scheme Provinces, if they wished to take part in economic and administrative planning on a large scale, could cede to the Centre optional subjects in addition to the compulsory ones mentioned above.
   Such 		a scheme 		would, in our 		view, present 		considerable constitutional 		disadvantages and 		anomalies. It 		would be 		very difficult to 		work a 		Central Executive 		and Legislature 		in which 		some Ministers, who 		dealt with Compulsory 		subjects, were 		responsible to 		the whole 		of India 		while other Ministers, 		who dealt 		with optional 		subjects, would 		be responsible 		only to 		those Provinces 		which had 		elected to 		act together 		in respect 		of such 		subjects. This 		difficulty would 		be accentuated 		in the 		Central Legislature, 		where it 		would be 		necessary to 		exclude certain members 		from speaking 		and voting 		when subjects 		with which their 		Provinces were 		not concerned were 		under discussion.  
 Apart from the difficulty of working such a scheme, we do not consider that it would be fair to deny to other Provinces, which did not desire to take the optional subject at the Centre, the right to form themselves into a group for a similar purpose. This would indeed be no more than the exercise of their autonomous powers in a particular way.
   Before 		 putting  forward 		 our  recommendations  		we  turn  to   deal   		with the  relationship  		of  the  Indian  States 		 to  British 		  India.   It   is   		quite   clear   that with  the  attainment 		 of  independence  by  		British  India, 		 whether  inside   or 		  out- side the British 		Commonwealth, the 		relationship which 		has hitherto existed  
 between the Rulers of  the  States  and  the  British  Crown  will  no  longer  be possible. Paramountcy can neither  be  retained  by  the  British  Crown  nor transferred to the new Government. This fact has been fully recognised by those whom we interviewed from the States. They have at the same time assured us that the States are ready and willing to co-operate in the new development of India. The precise form which their co-operation will take must be a matter for negotiation during the building up of the new constitutional structure, and it by no means follows that it will be indentical for all the States. We have not therefore dealt with the States in the same detail as the Provinces of the British India in the paragraphs which follow.
   We 		now indicate 		the nature 		of a solution 		which in our 		view would be 		just to the 		essential claims 		of all 		parties, and 		would at 		the same 		time be most 		likely to bring about a stable and practicable form of constitution for all India.  
 We recommend that the constitution should take the following basic form :
  There 	should be 	a Union 	of India, 	embracing both British 	India and the 	States, which 	should deal 	with the following 	subjects : Foreign 	Affairs, Defence, 	and Communications; and 	which should have the powers 	necessary to 	raise the 	finances required for 	the above subjects.  The 	Union should have 	an Executive 	and a 	Legislature constituted 	from British 	Indian and States’ 	representatives. Any 	question raising a 	major communal 	issue in the Legislature should require for its 	decision  a 	 majority of 	the representatives 	present and 	voting of 	each of 	the two 	major communities as 	well as 	a majority 	of all 	the members present and 	voting.  All 	subjects other than the 	Union subjects and 	all residuary powers 	should vest in 	the Provinces.  The 	States will retain all subjects and powers other than those ceded to 	the Union.  Provinces 	should be free 	to form 	Groups with executives and 	legislatures, and 	each Group could 	determine the 	Provincial subjects to 	be taken in 	common.  The 	Constitution of 	the Union and 	of the Groups should contain 	a provision 	whereby any Province 	could, by a majority 	vote of 	its Legislative 	Assembly, call for 	a reconsideration 	of the terms of the 	constitution after 	an initial 	period of 10 years 	and at 10 yearly 	intervals thereafter. 
   It 		is not our object 		to lay 		out the details of 		a constitution 		on the 		above lines, 		but to 		set in 		motion the 		machinery whereby a 		constitution can 		be settled 		by Indians 		for Indians.  
 It has been necessary however for us to make this recommendation as to the
 
 broad basis of the future constitution because it becomes clear to us in the course of our negotiations that not until that has been done was there any hope of getting the two major communities to join in the setting up of the  constitution-making machinery.
   We 		now indicate 		the constitution-making 		machinery which we 		propose should 		be brought 		into being forthwith 		in order 		to enable 		a new 		Constitution to 		be worked out.  In 		forming any 		Assembly to 		decide a 		new Constitutional 		structure the first 		problem is 		to obtain as 		broad-based and 		accurate a 		representation of 		the whole population 		as is possible. 		The most satisfactory 		method obviously 		would be 		by election 		based on adult 		franchise; but any 		attempt to 		introduce such a 		step now 		would lead to 		a wholly unacceptable 		delay in the 		formulation of 		the new Constitution. 		The only 		practicable alternative 		is to utilize 		the recently 		elected Provincial Legislative 		Assemblies as 		the electing bodies. 		There are, however, 		two factors 		in their 		composition which make 		this difficult. 		First, the 		numerical  strength  of 		 the Provincial 		Legislative Assemblies do 		not bear 		the same 		proportion to 		the total population 		in each 		Province. Thus, 		Assam with a population 		of 10 millions 		has a 		Legislative Assembly of 		108 members, 		while Bengal, with a 		population six 		times as 		large has 		an Assembly 		of only 		250. Secondly, owing to 		the weightage 		given to minorities 		by the Communal 		Award, the strengths 		of the several 		communities in each 		Provincial Legislative 		Assembly are not in 		proportion to 		their numbers 		in the Province. 		Thus the number of the 		seats reserved 		for Muslims  in 		 the  Bengal  Legislative 		Assembly is only 		48 per 		cent of 		the total, 		although they form 55 		per cent 		of the Provincial 		population. After a 		most careful 		consideration of 		the various methods 		by which 		these inequalities 		might be 		corrected, we have come to the 		conclusion that the 		fairest and 		the most 		practicable plan would be—  
 to 	allot to 	each Province 	a total 	number of seats 	proportional to its 
 population, roughly in the ratio of one to a million, as the nearest substitute for representation by adult suffrage.
  to 	divide this provincial 	allocation of seats 	between the main communities in 	each Province 	in proportion 	to their population.  to 	provide that 	the representatives 	allotted to 	each community in 	a Province shall 	be elected 	by the 	members of that community 	in its 	Legislative Assembly. 
 We think that for these purposes it is sufficient to recognize only three main communities in India; General, Muslim, and Sikh, the  “General”  community including all persons who are not Muslims or Sikhs. As the smaller minorities would, upon the population basis, have little or no representation, since they would lose the weightage which assures them seats in the Provincial Legislatures, we have made the arrangements set out in paragraph 20 below to give them a full
 representation upon all matters of special interest to the minorities.
 (19) (i) We therefore propose  that  there  shall  be  elected  by  each  Pro- vincial Legislative Assembly the following numbers of representatives, each part of  the  Legislative  (General,  Muslim  or   Sikh)  electing   its   own   representatives by  the  method   of   proportional   representation   with   the   single   transferable vote :—

 To Section B will be added a representative of British Baluchistan.
  It 	is the intention that 	the States 	 should  be  given 	 in  the  final 	Constituent  Assembly 	 appropriate  	representation  which 	  would   not,   on 	  the basis 	of  the 	 calculations  adopted 	 for  British  India, 	 exceed  93,  but 	 the   method   of 	selection will 	have to be determined 	by consultation. 	The States 	would in the 	preliminary stage be 	represented by 	a Negotiating 	Committee.  The 	representatives thus 	chosen shall meet at New 	Delhi as soon 	as possible.  A 	preliminary meeting will 	be held 	at which 	the general 	order of business 	will be decided, 	a Chairman 	and other 	officers elected, and an 	Advisory Committee 	(see paragraph 20 	below) on 	the rights of 	citizens, minorities, and 	tribal and 	excluded areas 	set up. Thereafter 	the provincial 	representatives will 	divide up into 	three sections 	shown A, B and C, in the 	Table of 	Representation in 	the sub-paragraph (i) 	of this paragraph.  These 	sections shall proceed to 	settle the 	Provincial Constitutions 	for the 	Provinces included 	in each section, and 	shall also 	decide whether any Group 	Constitution shall 	be set 	up for 	those Provinces 	and, if 	so, with what provincial 	subjects the 	Group should deal. 	Provinces, shall 	have the power 	to opt 	out of the 	Groups in 	accordance with the 	provisions of 	sub-clause (viii) below.  The 	representatives of 	the Sections and 	the Indian States shall 	reassemble for the 	purpose of 	settling the 	Union Constitution.  In 	the Union 	Constituent Assembly 	resolutions varying the 	provisions of 	paragraph 15 	above or 	raising any 	major communal issue 	shall require a majority 	of the representatives present and voting of each of the two major communities. 
 The Chairman of the Assembly shall decide which (if any) of the resolutions raise major communal issues and shall, if so requested by a majority of the representatives of either of the major communities, consult the Federal Court before giving his decision.
  As 	soon as 	the new constitutional 	arrangements have 	come into operation, 	it shall 	be open 	to any 	Province to 	elect to 	come out of 	any Group 	in which 	it has been 	placed. Such a decision 	shall be taken 	by the new legislature 	of the 	Province after the 	first general election 	under the new constitution. 
  The 	Advisory Committee on 	the rights 	of citizens, 	minorities, and tribal 	and excluded 	areas should 	contain full 	representation of 	the interests 	affected, and their 	function will 	be to report 	to the 	Union Constituent 	Assembly upon the 	list of 	Fundamental Rights the clauses for the protection of minorities, and a scheme for the 
 administration of the tribal and excluded areas, and to advise whether these rights should be incorporated in the Provincial Group, or Union constitution.
  His 	Excellency the 	Viceroy will forthwith 	request the Provincial 	Legislatures to 	proceed with the 	election of 	their representatives and 	the States to 	set up 	a Negotiating Committee. 	It is hoped 	that the process 	of constitution-making 	can proceed 	as rapidly 	as the complexities 	of the task 	permit so that 	the interim 	may be as 	short as possible.  It 	will be 	necessary to 	negotiate a 	Treaty between the 	Union Constituent 	Assembly and the United 	Kingdom to provide 	for certain 	matters arising out of 	the transfer 	of power.  While 	the constitution-making 	proceeds, the 	administration of 	India has 	to be carried 	on. We attach 	the greatest 	importance therefore to 	the setting up 	at once of an Interim 	Government having 	the support 	of the 	major political 	parties. It is 	essential during the 	interim period that there 	should be the 	maximum of 	co-operation in 	carrying through the 	difficult tasks that face 	the Government 	of india. 	Besides the heavy 	task of day-to-day 	administration, there is 	the grave 	danger of famine 	to be 	countered; there are 	decisions to 	be taken in 	many matters 	of post-war 	development which will 	have a far-reaching 	effect on India’s 	future; and there are important 	international conferences 	in which 	India has to be 	represented.   For 	all these purposes 	 a Government 	having popular support is 	necessary. The 	Viceroy has 	already started 	discussions to this 	end, and hopes soon 	to form 	an Interim 	Government in which 	all the 	portfolios, including 	that of 	War Member, 	will be 	held by 	Indian leaders having 	the full confidence of 	the people. The 	British Government, 	recognising the 	significance of 	the changes 	in the 	Government of 	India, will give the 	fullest measure 	of co-operation 	to the 	Government so 	formed, in 	the accomplishment 	and in 	bringing about 	as rapid 	and smooth 	a transition 	as possible.  To 	the leaders 	and people 	of India 	who now have the 	opportunity of 	complete independence we 	would finally say 	this. We 	and our Government 	and countrymen 	hoped that it would 	be possible 	for the Indian 	people themselves to 	agree upon the 	method of 	framing the 	new constitution under 	which they will live. Despite 	the labours 	which we have 	shared with 	the Indian Parties, and 	the exercise of 	much patience 	and goodwill 	by all, 	this has not been 	possible. We 	therefore now 	lay before 	you proposals 	which, after listening to 	all sides and after much earnest 	thought, we 	trust will enable you 	to attain 	your independence in the 	shortest time and 	with the least 	danger of internal 	disturbance and conflict. 	These proposals may not, 	of course, 	completely satisfy all 	parties, but 	you will recognize with 	us that 	at this 	supreme moment in 	Indian history 	statesmanship demands mutual accommodation. 
 We ask you to consider the alternative to acceptance of these proposals. After  all the efforts which we and the Indian Parties have made together for agreement, we
 must state that in our view there in small hope of peaceful settlement by agreement of the Indian Parties alone. The alternative would therefore be a grave danger of violence, chaos, and even civil war. The result and duration of such a disturbance cannot be foreseen; but it is certain that it would be a terrible disaster for many millions of men, women and children. This is a possibility which must be regarded with equal abhorrence by the Indian people, our own countrymen, and the world as a whole.
 We therefore lay these proposals before you in the profound hope that they will be accepted and operated by you in the spirit of accommodation and good will in which they are offered. We appeal to all who have the future good of India at heart to extend their vision beyond their own community or interest to the interests of the whole four hundred millions of the Indian people.
 We hope that the new independent India may choose to be a member of the British Commonwealth. We hope in any event that you will remain in close and friendly association with our people. But these are matters for your own free choice. Whatever that choice may be we look forward with you to your ever increasing prosperity among the great nations of the world, and to a future even more glorious than your past.

 LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE’S PRESS CONFERENCElibtech_1043_footnote
 [May 17, 1946]
 Q.	Can the Constituent Assembly be regarded as sovereign in view of three points that are put forward, viz.,
 Adult 	suffrage has been ruled out; British 	troops would continue to 	remain on 	the soil;  The 	principle and 	the procedure of 	the constitution-making 	body have 	been laid down. 
 A.	After dealing with the first two points the Secretary of State said :
 The third question was whether, as we had laid down certain provisions, the constitution-making body  or  Constituent  Assembly  could  be  regarded  in  any sense as sovereign.  Well, we only laid  these  conditions  down  because  Indians did not come to an agreement among themselves.  If it had been possible for the  two Indian  parties  to  come  together  to  make  a  constitution,  we  should  have made no stipulations of any kind. But when we got here, we found, what we sus- pected in advance, that a  Constituent Assembly representing all parties could not  be acceptable except on certain decisions taken in advance. We then asked the
 
 Indian parties whether they themselves by agreement would lay  down  certain decisions  which  would  enable  the  Constituent  Assembly  to  meet   together   and to function, and we tried our very best to get that agreed to and we went a consi- derable  distance  towards  getting  agreement  on   that  point,  but  we   did  not   get all the way, and therefore only because of that we suggested this basis  and  we made these recommendations, because it is only on those that we felt that we could get representatives of all parties to sit together and try and draw up a constitution. But even so, I would point [out] to you that even that basis can be altered but it can only be altered by a separate majority of each party who desire to do so and the reason   is this that these representatives of different parties have never agreed to meet together on that basis. That is what we believe is the basis on which they will come together. If they do come together on that basis, it will mean that they will have accepted that basis, but they can still change it if by a majority of each party they desire to do so.

 LETTER FROM LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCElibtech_1044_footnote
 Confidential	OFFICE OF THE CABINET DELEGATION, THE VICEROY’S HOUSE,
NEW  DELHI,
 May 20, 1946
 MY DEAR GANDHIJI,
 Since receiving your two letters of the 19th and 20th, we have had an official communication from the Congress raising the same points.libtech_1045_footnote
 As we intend shortly to reply to this letter I will not in this answer deal with the various matters you raise.libtech_1046_footnote
 As some of the paragraphs in your second letter do not accord with my recollection or that of Sir Stafford, I am enclosing a note setting out the matters on which we differ. We confirm as you imply in your paragraphs 6 and 7 that we told you quite definitely that we could not agree with the propositions you there set out. The Delegation wish me in particular to make it plain that independence must follow and not precede the coming into operation of the new Constitution.
 All good wishes.
        K. 		GANDHI, ESQ.   Sincerely 	yours,  PETHICK-LAWRENCE 
      
 ENCLOSURE
   We 		gave no 		such assurance 		but stated 		that we were 		investigating the position 		on the 		lines stated.  On 		this matter 		we said 		there would have 		to be consultations 		as set 		out in paragraph 		14 of the Statement 		which we read 		to you and that 		a part 		of them 		would no doubt 		be between 		the Chancellor 		of the 		Chamber of 		Princes and 		the President of 		Congress.  This 		was your 		suggestion. We 		stated that it 		was proposed 		to appoint 		a person in the best way possible to ensure his representative character.  In 		the second 		paragraph you are 		misinterpreting what 		Sir Stafford said. 		He stated 		that he knew 		the view 		was held 		that in the 		past Paramountcy had 		been used 		in certain cases to 		support the 		Princes against their 		people but that 		in the 		interim period 		the Crown 		Representative would want to 		help forward the 		movement towards 		democracy in 		the States 		so as to make 		it easier 		for them to 		come into the Union. 		It was 		also stated 		by us that Paramountcy 		would be exercised by the Crown Representative and 		that it 		would not 		be in consultation 		with the Interim 		Government, though 		there might be 		consultation between the 		Interim Government and 		the States on 		matters of 		common economic interest.

 APPENDIX XXIII
 LETTER FROM ABUL KALAM AZAD TO LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCElibtech_1047_footnote
 20  AKBAR   ROAD,
 NEW  DELHI,
 May 20, 1946
 DEAR LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE,
 My Committee have carefully considered the Statement issued by the Cabinet Delegation on May 16th, and they have seen Gandhiji after the interviews he has had with you and Sir Stafford Cripps. There are certain matters about which I have been asked to write to you.
 As  we  understand  the  Statement,   it   contains   certain   recommendations and  procedure  for  the  election  and  functioning  of  the   Constituent   Assembly. The Assembly itself, when formed, will in my Committee’s opinion, be a soverign body for the purpose   of   drafting   the   Constitution unhindered  by	any external authority, as well as for entering into a treaty. Further that it will be open to the Assembly to vary in any way it likes the recommendations and the procedure
 suggested by the Cabinet Delegation. The Constituent Assembly being a sovereign body for the purpose of the Constitution, its final decisions will automatically take effect.
 As you are aware some recommendations have been made in your Statement which are contrary to the Congress stand as it was taken at the Simla Conference and elsewhere. Naturally we shall try to get the Assembly to remove what we consider defects in the recommendations. For this purpose we shall endeavour to educate the country and the Constituent Assembly.
 There is one matter in which my Committee were pleased to hear Gandhiji say that you were trying to see that the European members in the various Prvincial Assemblies, particularly Bengal and Assam, would neither offer themselves as candidates nor vote for the election of delegates to the Constituent Assembly.
 No provision has been made for the election of a representative from British Baluchistan. So far as we know, there is no elected Assembly or any other kind of chamber which might select such a representative. One individual may not make much of a difference in the Constituent Assembly. But it would make a difference if such an individual speaks for a whole province which he really does not represent in any way. It is far better not to have representation at all than to have this kind of representation which will mislead and which may decide the fate of Baluchistan contrary to the wishes of its inhabitants. If any kind of popular representation can be arranged, we would welcome it. My Committee were pleased, therefore, to hear Gandhiji say that you are likely to include Baluchistan within the scope of the Advisory Committee’s work.
 In your recommendations for the basic form of the Constitution (page 3 of the printed draft, No. 5) you state that provinces should be free to form groups with executives and legislatures and each group could determine the provincial subjects to be taken in common. Just previous to this you state that all subjects other than the union subjects and all residuary powers should vest in the provinces. Later on in the Statement, however, on page 5 you state that the provincial representatives to the Constituent  Assembly  will  divide  up  into  three  sections  and  “these   sections shall proceed to settle the Provincial Constitutions  for  the  Provinces  in  each section and shall also decide whether any group constitution shall be set up for those Provinces”. There apppears to us to be marked discrepancy in these two separate provisions. The basic provision gives full autonomy to a province to do what it likes and subsequently there appears to be a certain compulsion  in  the matter   which    clearly   infringes   that   autonomy.		It  is  true  that  at  a  later stage  the   Provinces  can   opt  out   of  any  group.	In any event it  is  not  clear how  a  Province  or  its  representatives  can   be   compelled   to   do   something which they do not want to do. A Provincial Assembly may give a mandate to its
 
 representatives not to enter any group or a particular group or section. As Sections B and C have been formed it is obvious that one Province will play a dominating role in the Section, the Punjab in Section B and Bengal in Section C. It is conceivable that this dominating Province may frame a Provincial Constitution entirely against the wishes of Sind or the North-West Frontier Province or Assam. It may  even conceivably lay down rules, for elections and otherwise, thereby nullifying the Provision for a Province to opt out of a group. Such could never be the intention as it would be repugnant to the basic principles and policy of the Scheme itself.
 The question of Indian States has been left vague and, therefore, I need not say much about it at this stage. But it is clear that State representatives who come into the Constituent Assembly must do so more or less in the same way as the representatives of the Provinces. The Constituent Assembly cannot be formed of entirely disparate elements.
 I have dealt above with some points arising out of your Statement. Possibly some of them can be cleared up by you and the defects removed. The principal point, however, is, as stated above, that we look upon this Constituent Assembly as a sovereign body which can decide as it chooses in regard to any matter before it and can give effect to its decision. The only limitation we recognize is that in regard to certain major communal issues the decision should be by a majority of each of the two major communities. We shall try to approach the public and the members of the Constituent Assembly with our own proposals for removing any defects in the recommendations made by you.
 Gandhiji has informed my Committee that you contemplate that British troops will remain in India till after the establishment of the Government in accordance with the instrument produced by the Constituent Assembly. My Committee feel that the presence of foreign troops in India will be a negation of India’s independence. India should be considered to be independent in fact from the moment that the National Provisional Government is established.
 I shall be grateful to have an early reply so that my Committee may come to a decision in regard to your Statement.
 Yours sincerely,
  K. AZAD

 APPENDIX XIV
 LETTER FROM LORD PETHICK-LAWRENCE TO ABUL KALAM AZADlibtech_1048_footnote
 May 22, 1946
 The Delegation have considered your letter of 20th May and feel that the best way to answer it is that they should make their general position quite clear to you. Since the Indian Leaders after prolonged discussion failed to arrive at an agreement, the Delegation have put forward their recommendations as the nearest approach to reconciling the views of the two main parties. The scheme therefore stands as a whole and can only succeed if it is accepted and worked in a spirit of compromise and co-operation.
 You are aware of the reasons for the grouping of the Provinces, and this is an essential feature of the scheme, which can only be modified by agreement between the two parties.
 There are two further points which we think we should mention. First, in your letter you describe the Constituent Assembly as a sovereign body, the final decisions of which will automatically take effect. We think the authority and the function of the Constituent Assembly and the procedure which it is intended to follow are clear from the Statement. Once the Constituent Assembly is formed and working on this basis, there is naturally no intention to interfere with its discretion or to question its decisions. When the Constituent Assembly has completed its labours, His Majesty’s Government will recommend to Parliament such action as may be necessary for the cession of sovereignty to the Indian people, subject only to two provisos which are mentioned in the Statement and which are not, we believe controversial, namely, adequate provision for the protection of minorities and willingness to conclude a treaty to cover matters arising out of the transfer of power.
 Secondly, while His Majesty’s Government are most anxious to secure that the interim period should be as short as possible, you will, we are sure, appreciate that for the reasons stated above independence cannot precede the bringing into operation of  a new Constitution.
