libtech_8_footnote,"1In a letter of March 26, 1924 from New York, to Devdas Gandhi, Drew Pearson threw light on the manner in which the script of the “interview” was prepared for release. Enclosing “the copy of the interview with father which you so kindly cabled me recently,” Pearson went on to write, “You will note that the editor has taken certain privileges with the interview by dating it as cabled from India. My original article explains that the interview was cabled by you. The interview appeared in about 50 papers in the United States, the list of which I enclose, together with 8 papers in Australia and New Zealand, 3 in Japan and China, 4 in Canada and was sent to other papers in Brazil, Argentine, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, South Africa and Hawaii. You will note that I have enlarged a little bit on your skeletonized cable. In such places where you referred to the fact that your father’s views do not change, I looked up his views as recorded in speeches and clippings from Young India and used such as a basis for enlarging the interview. I did this rather in a hurry and there was not time for your approval, but I trust it will be satisfactory for you.” Acknowledging Devdas Gandhi’s letter of March 7, Pearson wrote again on April 15, thanking him for his “trouble and thoughtfulness in telegraphing the message from your father. As I told you in an earlier letter, it was published widely all over the United States. I trust your father did not object to my quoting from his past speeches and writings. . . The telegram arrived in its original form without censorship.”"

He had 	written: “I 	have known 	Panikkar by 	repute for 	several years and 	met him for a short 	time in 	Cocanada. I 	am sure 	his presence 	will be very 	useful in Amritsar. 	His ignorance 	of Hindustani 	will be   a 	drawback, but 	this will be 	more than compensated by 	his other 	attainments. He will be 	an excellent man 	for publicity work. 	Perhaps, owing to his 	language difficulty, he 	might not 	be very 	helpful in bringing 	the Sikhs 	and Hindus 	nearer to each 	other. But on 	the whole 	Panikkar will be an 	acquisition in 	Amritsar. As 	regards terms, anything 	that you consider 	reasonable will surely 	be agreed 	to by all 	others. Technically, the 	Working Committee will 	not meet 	till the 21st 	April. The terms 	suggested in 	your telegram 	are rather 	complicated, but that 	is for 	you to decide. 	I am glad 	that Panikkar 	contemplates a 	lengthy stay at 	Amritsar. Personally, I 	doubt if 	it will be 	necessary for 	him to 	stay for 	many months. 	There is just 	a possibility 	of Gidwani 	coming out sooner 	and an 	equal possibility of 	Gidwani’s successor 	going in.
