The following extended 	version of the cable was published in The 	Times of India, 12-8-1909 	and The Hindu, 	19-8-1909 : “The 	Transvaal Government agree to repeal the Asiatic Act of 1907, but 	they desire to insert a clause in the Immigration Law limiting the 	annual number of Asiatic immigrants. The Indian deputation have 	declined to agree to legal differentiation upon racial lines, and 	have proposed that a clause may be inserted in the Immigration Law 	empowering the Government of the Transvaal to frame regulations 	fixing the number of immigrants of any nationality, thereby 	maintaining the principle of legal equality without interfering with 	existing powers of administrative differentiaton.”"

libtech_40_footnote,"1Vide “Letter 	to Lord Ampthill”,9-8-1909 Commenting on this Lord Ampthill had 	observed: “So far as I can judge, you would actually be securing a 	recognition of right, though of course a very limited one, if the 	law itself were to declare that six Indians per annum may be 	admitted annually as permanent residents. It would be the gain of a 	practical and positive, though limited, right as against the 	theoretical and unavailable right which you are contending. The 	‘proviso’ which you suggest seems to me to be a clever solution 	of the difficulty and I shall at once try what can be done with it, 	but without letting it be known that it comes from you.”"

Indian Opinion published the Leader’s critical editorial of July 10 on the prevailing prison system and the character of the enquiry, demanding a fresh judicial investigation of the case. The issue also contained similar comments by the Pretoria News and the Jewish Chronicle and letters addressed by a number of influential European ministers of religion to the Transvaal Press.

Mr. Gokhale has read it, thinks it good and, whilst, he considers it much too strong in parts (I have since toned it down somewhat), has passed it. Mr. Jehangir Petit has personally undertaken to charge himself with the cost of printing and publishing 20,000 copies. I have illustrated it from my own photos. There will be a block of Volksrust Gaol and another of Pretoria Gaol, with suitable letter press . . .” The pamphlet was entitled A Tragedy of Empire: The treatment of British Indians in the Transvaal.

In a 	reply dated September 	29, Smuts 	denied the deportation 	to India, 	and pointed 	out that 	“Mr. Gandhi does not 	state whether the 	person claims (1) 	to have 	been resident here for 	three years prior to 	the 11th 	October 1899, 	(2) to 	have been in 	lawful possession 	of a 	permit to 	enter the 	Colony or 	(3) that 	he was 	resident and 	actually in 	the Transvaal 	on the 	31st May, 1902.” He 	added that, 	if Gandhiji would furnish 	the names of the Indians 	regarding whom his 	 complaints were 	made, full particulars of 	the facts about their 	deportation could 	be supplied."

I told him what I thought about the matter—that the expression gave people to understand that I was a paid agitator. I explained to him that I was a solicitor, etc., etc., and that I received a retainer for my legal work and that my expenses as a member of the deputation were paid. I told him that what I received from public funds did not pay my expenses— Millie will bear only too willing testimony to this! I did not conceal anything from him, and he wound up by telling me that he thought that it was ‘a fine distinction’. Then I let fly. Afterwards I sent him my (your) biography from I[ndian] O[pinion]. But this only shows that it will be better to call my remuneration a retainer rather than a salary.  It preserves the honorary nature of the work and after all, as a salary it  is utterly inadequate, whereas as a retainer, it is fair. You and I understand all about it,  but people like this think it is ‘a fine distinction’, and can’t understand disinterested work. You might pass this on to South Africa.”"
