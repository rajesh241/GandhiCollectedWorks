libtech_11_footnote,"1On February 11, 1913, Ampthill had asked in the House of Lords whether the Imperial Government had received official information in confirmation of Press reports that Gokhale’s visit to South Africa had been successful, and if there was hope of an early and satisfactory settlement of the British Indian question. He also moved for Papers. In the course of his speech, Ampthill said that it was an Imperial question “of the first magnitude” and had caused discontent in India which came to a climax at the Indian National Congress of 1911. The Imperial Government, he said, had approved of Gokhale’s visit. He further wanted to know what the Government had now done “to acknowledge and encourage and take advantage” of the resulting “spirit of reasonableness and conciliation and goodwill”. Lord Emmott, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the course of a “frigid and cautiously official” reply said that Gokhale’s visit was unofficial, that his representations to the South African Ministers were “informal” and that he had no Papers to lay before the House.

A very old established section of the Cape population, and a large one in point of numbers, viz., the Cape Malay community, has always followed the Mahomedan faith and conducted its marriages according to the tenets of that religion; but such unions, unless solemnized by a Marriage Officer, are not recognized under the Marriage Order-in-Council or officially recorded in any way."

libtech_445_footnote,"1Gandhiji was arrested near Palmford and charged with having brought unauth-orized persons into the Transvaal. He was produced before the magistrate at Volksrust and released on bail. The telegram was evidently dispatched after this. He was, however, re-arrested the next day at Standerton. For an account of the arrest at Palmford and the court proceedings, vide Satyagraha in South Africa, Ch. XLIV."
libtech_446_footnote,"1Gandhiji arrived at Standerton with  about  2,000  passive  resisters.  85 Indians who had left Hattingh Spruit Colliery were arrested. Gandhiji was charged with “aiding or abetting prohibited persons to enter the Transvaal”."
libtech_447_footnote,"1After Gandhiji was released on bail, a representative of Reuter who intervie- wed Gandhiji asked him “what he thought would be the outcome of the demonstra- tion”."
libtech_448_footnote,"2According to a report in The Transvaal  Leader,  when  the  Prosecutor protested against Gandhiji’s plea for bail, “the Magistrate pointed out that every prisoner not charged with a capital sentence was in law entitled to be allowed to give bail for his appearance, and said that Mr. Gandhi could not be deprived of that right.” Gandhiji was then released on his own recognizance of £50, and the case was remanded till the 21st.

Polak was charged before Mr. Jooste, Assistant Magistrate, under Section 20 of the Immigration Act, but declined to plead guilty to the charge. The evidence of five witnesses including Kallenbach and Gandhiji was called. Rifleman Joubert stated that he had seen Polak asking Gandhiji for instructions at Balfour and thought that Polak was one of the leaders of the movement. Constable Kneen stated that Polak had addressed the Indians and advised them to return to Charlestown. Kallenbach said that Polak’s intention had been to return to Durban. His purpose was to discuss certain matters with Gandhiji regarding his departure for India. Polak was found guilty and was awarded three months’ simple imprisonment without hard labour. Earlier, while awaiting trial in Volksrust Gaol, Polak had addressed a communication to Lord Ampthill, which furnished a detailed account of incidents leading to his arrest; vide “Polak’s letter to Lord Ampthill”, 12-11-1913."
