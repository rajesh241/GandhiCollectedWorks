	Kakasaheb says nothing new in his letter. But the subject has
	acquired added importance at the present juncture. If the Muslims in
	India owe loyalty to India and have chosen to make it their home of
	their own free will, it is their duty to learn the two scripts. It
	is said that the Hindus have no place in Pakistan. So they migrate
	to the Indian Union. In the event of a war between the Union and
	Pakistan, the Muslims of the Indian Union should be prepared to
	fight against Pakistan. It is true that there should be no war
	between the two dominions. They have to live as friends or die as
	such. The two will have to work in close co-operation. In spite of
	being independent of each other, they will have many things in
	common. If they are  enemies, they can have nothing in common. If
	there is genuine friendship, the people of both the States can be
	loyal to both. They are both members of the same Commonwealth of
	nations. How can they become enemies of each other? But that 
	discussion  is unnecessary here.</p>

	The Union must have a common inter provincial speech. I will go a
	step further and say that if the two States are friends, Hindustani
	should be the common speech between the two. This does not mean that
	Urdu and Hindi will cease to exist as distinct forms of speech. They
	must continue to live and progress. But if the Hindus and the
	Muslims or rather people of all religions in India are friends, they
	must accept a common language evolved from Hindi and Urdu. They
	should learn the two scripts. This will be a test for the Muslims
	and the Hindus in the Indian Union.</p>

	It would be wrong to say that if the Muslims of the Union refuse to

day, people may not appreciate this simple proposition. If the Hindus
wish to, they can boycott the Urdu script and Urdu words, but they
will be the losers thereby. Therefore those engaged in Hindustani
Prachar should not weaken in their faith or efforts. I agree that
people like Maulana Azad and other prominent Muslims of the Indian
Union should be the first to adopt Hindustani and the two scripts.
Who will take the lead if not they? Difficult times lie ahead of us.

	Shall I tell you who is my special physician? He is good for me and
	also good for you. My physician today, in my thought, speech and
	action, is Rama, Ishwar, Rahim. How can He become our physician? We
	heard a <i>bhajan </i>addressed to the Lord who removes all miseries
	of mind, body and soul which human beings are subject to. Hence I
	felt that the best, unfailing remedy is Ramanama.  I  can suggest no
	other remedy to those who come to me. Then take some earth and water
	treatment. I know that one who has Ramanama inscribed in his heart
	needs neither earth nor water for treatment. If we are destined to
	live we shall live. If we have to die, let us die. No one can ride
	two horses at the same time. If I have faith in Ramanama I must
	remain firm in that. Anyone not doing so will perish. Rama is the
	saviour. Does the person who has installed God in his heart ever
	die? This body is transitory. It may be living this moment and may
	die the next. How then can I be proud of it? It is futile to keep
	the body alive when the moment of death has arrived. Guru Nanak was
	a great religious leader. Other Gurus who came after him did write
	songs of devotion but they mentioned the name of Nanak in the
	refrain. This is the culture of India. Perhaps such things happen in
	many other countries. Whatever that may be, I can only talk of the
	Indian culture. Mirabai was a great devotee. Mira’s name is found
	at the end of countless <i>bhajans</i>. It was not she who used her
	name. But Mira’s disciples found great satisfaction in attributing

Dev<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

recite Ramanama or Khuda’s praise, one may serve <i>Gosain </i>or
Allah”. It is remarkable that this thing occurs in the Granth
Saheb. The allegations against the Sikhs today are, if true, a
violation of the teachings of Guru Nanak. That is not the way to
bring glory to the Granth Saheb. Nor can the Sikhs make any progress
that way. Some Sikh friends had a plain talk with me. They told me
that Guru Arjun Dev did not doubt the identity of Rama and Rahim or
Krishna and Karim. Then they told me that whether one went on
pilgrimage or <i>haj </i>it meant one and the same thing. One may
perform <i>puja </i>or bow his head, one may worship God in a temple
or bend oneself low in the name of God, one may read the Vedas or the
Book. The Book meant the Koran. One may dress oneself in blue clothes
or in white. The Muslim wears blue clothes and the orthodox Hindu
wears white. Then, one may be called a Turk or a Hindu. Turks means
Muslims. [Nanak] says that he who truly follows God’s laws knows
His secret.</p>

In the end I want to tell you that I had purposely mentioned war. But
our journalists always like to exaggerate things. They have given the
headlines that I wanted war. There are telegrams coming from Calcutta
that Gandhi also talks of war. Will there be a war then? What I had
said was that I could not think of war even in a dream. After all,
would I give up my creed at a critical time? My creed is non-
violence. I have never waged war, nor should anyone else do so. How
can we achieve anything by fighting? What I said was that if Pakistan
was committing mistakes or if India was committing mistakes, with
both the countries having their own independent Governments, how was
it possible for one Government to secure justice from the other? It
would be different if the two Governments worked in co-operation. Let
them have an arbitrator if they cannot work together. If even that
cannot be done, then we shall helplessly be dragged into war. Does
this imply advocating war? I want to tell both India and Pakistan
that they must come to a mutual settlement or accept an arbitrator.
But if the Pakistanis insist on taking India by force, then, as I
said yesterday, India would have no alternative except to fight. If I
am given the charge of the Government I would follow a different
path, because I have no military and police force under me. But I am
the only one to follow that path. Who would support me? Your
Government will do what is expected of it when the time comes. I
would continue to chant only one refrain. But, if people do not
understand non-violence, to whom can I address myself?</p>

to the blue blood of England. Marlborough family is very famous in
British history. Mr. Churchill took the helm when Great Britain was
in great danger after the Second World War started. No doubt he saved
the British Empire from a great danger at the time. It would be wrong
to argue that Great Britain could not have won without the help of
the United States or other Allied nations. Who else except a man of
Mr. Churchill’s sharp political diplomacy could have brought all
the friendly nations together? Great Britain acknowledged the
services of Mr. Churchill who in those days preserved the honour of
that country. But after winning the War the nation did not hesitate
to choose the Labour Government in order to recover from the terrible
loss of life and property which the British Isles had undergone
during the War. The British people saw the signs of the times and
decided in favour of voluntary abdication from power to end the
Empire and establishing instead the imperceptible rule of hearts.
India has been divided and then both the countries have voluntarily
announced their decision to join the British Commonwealth. The
honourable step of granting independence to India was taken by all
the parties representing the entire British nation. Mr. Churchill and
his party were also in line with others. It may be a different thing
that the future may or may not justify this step of the British
people. And this had nothing to do with my suggestion that because
Mr. Churchill has been a party to the transfer of power, he is
expected not to say or do anything which would deprive this measure
of its value. There is no doubt that in modern history there is no
instance which can be compared with the transfer of power by the
British. I am reminded of the sacrifice of Priyadarshi Ashoka. But
Ashoka is incomparable and, moreover, he does not belong to modern
history. That is why I was pained to read the Reuter’s despatch of
Mr. Churchill’s speech. I take it for granted that this renowned
news agency has not misreported Mr. Churchill’s speech. By his
speech Mr. Churchill has harmed his country which he has greatly
served. If he knew that India would be reduced to such a terrible
state after freeing itself from the rule of the British Empire, did
he, for a moment take the trouble of thinking that the entire
responsibility for it lies with the builders of the British Empire
and not with those “races” which, in Mr. Churchill’s opinion,
are capable of giving birth to the greatest civilization? In my view,
Mr. Churchill has been too hasty in his sweeping generalization.
India’s population is several millions. Out of these a few lakhs
have taken to the path of barbarism. But these people hardly count.
With confidence I invite</p>

Mr. Churchill to come to India and study the situation himself. But
he must come not as a representative of his Party with fixed
opinions, but as an impartial Englishman who values the prestige of
his country more than any Party’s and intends to help the British
Government in making this task a grand success. This unique step of
Great Britain would be judged from its consequences. The vivisection
of India unwittingly invited the two parts of the country to fight
each other. Granting freedom separately to the two parts seems like a
blot on the graceful gift of freedom. It is no use saying that either
side is free to come out of the British Commonwealth. This is easier
said than done.  I do not wish to say anything more on that account.
What I have said is enough to show why Mr. Churchill should have been
more careful while speaking on this subject. He has run down  his 
colleagues without even studying the situation.</p>

Many of you have given ground to Mr. Churchill for making such
remarks. You still have sufficient time to reform your ways and prove
Mr. Churchill’s prediction wrong. I know nobody listens to me these
days. Had it not been so, and had the people continued to listen to
me as they did before the negotiations for freedom started, there
never would have been that show of barbarism which Mr. Churchill has
described with such relish and gross exaggeration. And also you would
have been well on the way to solving your economic and other domestic
problems.</p>

English from the great role belonging to it as an international
medium. No Indian to my knowledge has ever desired to banish English
from India as a second language for study. But some of us have
undoubtedly desired to dethrone it from the place it has usurped.</p>

had written about South Africa in 1896 nearly cost me my life. It was
so hopelessly unwarranted that within  twenty-four hours of my being
lynched, European opinion in South Africa was turned from anger into

I hold that not a single mention of war in my speeches can be
interpreted to mean that there was any incitement to or approval of
war between Pakistan and the Union unless mere mention of it is to be
taboo. We have among us the superstition that the mere mention of a
snake ensures its appearance in the house in which the mention is
made even by a child. I hope no one in India entertains such
superstition about war.</p>

I claim that I rendered a service to both the sister States by
examining the present situation and definitely stating when the cause
of war could arise between the two States. This was done not to
promote war but to avoid it as far as possible. I endeavoured, too,
to show that if the insensate murders, loot and arson  by  people
continued, they would force the hands of their Governments. Was it
wrong to draw public attention to the logical steps that inevitably
followed one after another?</p>

India knows, the world should, that every ounce of my energy has been
and is being devoted to the definite avoidance of fratricide
culminating in war. When a man vowed to non-violence as the law
governing human beings dares to refer to war, he can only do it so as
to strain every nerve to avoid it. Such is my fundamental position
from which I hope never to swerve even to my dying day.</p>

So far as the war is concerned my speeches have been quite clear. The
summaries sent to America and elsewhere may be quite the contrary of
what I might have said. I shall deal with the question more fully in
my written speech today. As to the deteriorating situation I have
told you quite firmly that you should dispense with Sardar, or he
you. He won’t shoulder the burden without you, hence you should
take it up and reform the Cabinet with one mind. Rajen Babu should
give up food portfolio. He will do so gladly.</p>

I have always looked upon the wholesale accessions of States with
suspicion. They are probably a liability rather than an asset. This
sums up my reaction. We may discuss these things more fully when I

	It seems to me that we have all become savages. Both Hindus and
	Muslims have turned savage. Who can determine who has committed more
	crimes and who has committed less? We cannot go into these details.
	The Government should try to recall the refugees from Pakistan,
	which can be done only in consultation with the Government there.
	There are so many complications.  The Government is there to solve
	those complications. The Government should look after its people or
	resign. I have no doubt at all about it. Today our Government is
	something which we can strengthen  or bring down. That is democracy.
	People themselves should remain under control and exercise
	restraint. They must know the meaning of discipline and observe it.
	If they do not do this,  they  become worthless. We must learn this
	thing if we want to stick to our duty. We must inculcate this in our
	children from the time they start showing some understanding. You
	must tell your children that the place of religion is in their
	hearts and it is not in your power to protect it. You must tell them
	that you are their father and as their father you have to give them
	that training. I have taught my children that they must protect 
	their  own  religion.  One  of  my   sons<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

	religion of each one of them? I am not worrying. why should I? They
	are all grown up. I could protect their religion if they were young.
	And that too in what manner? I would tell them that if they were

the lathi is killed his relatives appear. The boy with the revolver
being alone brings his revolver, or a brengun or a stengun. And the
people on the opposite side would bring ten stenguns. They would
force him to embrace Islam or Christianity and threaten him with
their numbers and warn him that his weapons would not save him. And 
then,  although frightened, he would cry out that despite the

Following any religion means belonging to God.  The same thing
happened in the case of Prahlad. He used to repeat the name of Rama.
His father said he should stop it, but Prahlad replied that he could
utter no other name. There is a beautiful <i>bhajan </i>about it:
Prahlad writes the name of Rama while his guru is dictating another
name. He says that he can write no other name and he knows no other
name. It is a very sweet <i>bhajan</i>. Prahlad says that his pen can
shape no other name. It is said that Prahlad was a mere boy of
twelve. Well, that twelve-year-old boy opposed his father and saved
his religion. I need not describe how he protected his religion. All
Hindus are familiar with the story. But the important thing is that
he could protect his religion all by himself. Innumerable instances
of this kind can be found in all religions. Now we have our boys and
girls. If one believes that woman is weak, I would say that no woman
in the world is weak. All are strong. All those who have firm faith
in their religion are strong, not weak. So I would suggest that we
should first teach our boys and girls that they are not weak.
Children have their religion to strengthen them. When people come to
me I tell them that the Government should do everything in its power.
But it would be wrong to think that unless the Government did
something everybody would be converted to Islam. Millions of Muslims
are living in India today. It should be carefully considered who they
are. Not many of them have come from Arabia. Those who came from
Arabia did not constitute the millions. Those millions who became
Muslims were all Hindus. Or, say, they were Buddhists. What is the
difference between Buddhists and Hindus? In my view there is no
difference. Should we not have proper knowledge as to who inhabited
Afghanistan? Badshah Khan told me that the Afghans were originally
Buddhists and later embraced Islam. But, for that matter, have they
forgotten their ancient culture? How could they forget? He told me
that even the names of their villages were orginally in Sanskrit.
They have changed their names, dress and everything else; but they
could not change what was</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
lying deep within. How could they forget it? And then, whether in
Madras or Bengal or anywhere else, they were all Hindus. You ask them
as I ask myself, why they chose to embrace Islam. I am to be blamed
for their conversion to Islam. I must do penance; you must, too. Of
course, if they have done the correct thing and accepted a religion
which is nobler than Hinduism, then let us follow in their footsteps,
recite the <i>Kalma</i>, swear by Islam and raise the cry for the
victory of Islam! But nothing like that happened. Whom then shall we
beat up and whom shall we drive out? They are our own people. They
were all Hindus at the time of our grandfathers and great
grandfathers, say, four generations ago, and got converted to Islam.
I have gone round all over the country and reminded the Hindus of
their wickedness in considering untouchability part of their
religion. What has been the result? One part of our community has
become the fifth <i>varna</i>. Originally there were four <i>varnas
</i>and we made them five and considered the fifth <i>varna </i>as
<i>Ati-Shudras</i>. We kept the fifth <i>varna </i>segregated from
us. We kept their food separate and declared that they could not live
in our midst. We decided to treat them as our slaves. Later they
turned to Islam. So all of them were not originally Muslims. Later on
some Brahmins also were converted to Islam. Quite a few of them also
came from among Kshatriyas as also Vaishyas. But their number was
very small. I have shown you how the present crores of Muslims had
embraced Islam. Untouchability drove them to Islam. Today we are
creating such uproar in India and want to beat up and harass the
Muslims and drive them out of the country by any means. No one ever
bothers to think from where they should be driven out and where they
should be pushed out. We must realize that when someone is attacked
and forced into accepting Islam, afterwards he is doomed for no fault
of his. But I move about among Muslims and my Muslim friends tell me
that Islam has never advocated forcible conversion. People may accept
it voluntarily. They may be made aware of the greatness of Islam. But
they cannot be brought to accept Islam by cheating or by paying
money. The Muslims in this country are all our blood-brothers. That
is why I say that we must act only after careful thought. We must
consider why they were drawn  to Islam. Did they accept Islam for
money? Even if you want to earn money or do anything else, go
anywhere in the world, you take your religion with you. If you
discard religion, you have discarded everything. I want to tell you
only one thing and it is that we should not try to kill any Muslim.
Let them kill if they want. If they kill that</p>

is bad. We would consider them bad. But if they are bad, why should
we be bad in return? We can return their wickedness with goodness. If
they drink liquor, should we also do the same? I would call upon all
Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs to come to their senses and see what
religion teaches. As Iqbal said, “religion does not teach mutual
hatred”. When Iqbal said this he was in London. He was a great
poet. He had come to attend the Round Table Conference. I was invited
to a dinner arranged in his honour. I went for the dinner. He said
that he was a Brahmin? Why was he a Brahmin? Because his forefathers
were Brahmins. Where did they live? In Kashmir. He said he belonged
to Kashmir and was a Brahmin who was converted to Islam. They were
all converted to Islam not recently but long ago. But they  had 
Brahmin blood and Islamic culture in them. So Iqbal said that
religion did not teach us to hate one another. Afterwards he wrote
many other things but that is another matter. Now Iqbal is no more.
But let us learn at least this much, that our religion does not teach
us hatred. That is why I would like to call upon you to be human. If
we become human, we raise the stock of India. Today we are bringing
the country down. God forbid that we should bring about India’s
downfall.</p>

	I have your frank letter. You have done well to write about

	confidence in yourself. It will be enough if you improve your

	healthy. But only if the term “Oneself” is interpreted in the
	widest sense is this statement true. If it is interpreted too

	You are fully entitled to write to me as you did concerning my fast;
	but you have not thought over it deeply. You might have had doubts
	about my earlier fasts, but you should not have the slightest doubt
	about the recent one. Even my opponents have welcomed it. No one has
	been compelled to do anything for fear of my death. The fast
	awakened their goodness. What dharma is it to behave as a brute
	towards a brute? The country and Hindu dharma  are  declining

	if you feel like it. I hope all of you are all right.</p>

	A lady writes to me in a letter that she is desirous of doing
	service and her husband also wishes to do the same, but no one shows
	them the way. There are many people who pose such questions. I have
	given only one reply to all of them and it is that the scope for
	Government jobs is very limited whereas the scope for service is
	immense. Hence there is no need to ask anyone what should be done.
	Anyone who wishes to serve can do so. But we have become so helpless
	that we have to consult others. Shall I then tell you what they
	should do? After all, how much reputation does Delhi enjoy for being
	clean city? There are so many camps here, and I know how clean they
	are. People fall ill while they are there. It is equally filthy
	where there has been bloodshed and destruction of property. The
	Delhi Municipality has never been known for cleanliness. Had Delhi
	been a clean city the hearts of the people would have been clean
	too. Wherever we may be, if we keep our places clean, it will have
	its impact on the whole city. Let every man keep his own house, his
	own heart clean. I will tell that lady that if she is really keen to
	do service, not in name but in the true spirit of devotion, then
	there is ample</p>

I have just received two telegrams. One of the telegrams which is
from a Muslim friend states that Indians used to be considered very
sensible and that Hindus and Muslims were supposed to be living in
amity. But now what has gone wrong that they cannot sit together and
are fighting with each other, indulging in mutual killing and
behaving as savages? Let us take the example of Delhi. The Hindus and
Sikhs of Delhi are willing to accept the Muslims in their fold
provided they declare their loyalty to the Indian Union. Those who
wish to remain in the Indian Union, whether it is I or you or anybody
else, have got to abide by this. This condition is applicable not
only to the Muslims but to everybody. Then, the Muslims possess
plenty of arms. Quite a large stock of these arms has been recovered.
But not all arms have yet been surrendered. Searches are going on
with the help of the police. But everything cannot come out with the
help of the police. So, if they are honest at heart and do not wish
to fight against India, they should be loyal to the Union. They
should even fight any Muslim power  attacking India. And if they do
not wish to fight against India, why do they need the arms? There are
very few Christians here, but they too would have to fight on behalf
of the Union in the event of a war with another country like Germany
or any other Christian country and will have to remain loyal to the
country. If the Muslims are loyal and they have no intention of
fighting against India, why do they need the arms? They must
voluntarily surrender their arms. This is all very well. But the way
this was said contained poison. Today there are nearly 50,000 Muslims
in the camps. We have driven them out of Delhi. Some have been
killed. However brave a person may be, he does not welcome death.
Somebody may want to do business or something else. He takes comfort
in the fact that he will at least be alive. Where could they go after
running away? So they have taken shelter in the Purana Quila, and on
the grounds near Humayun’s tomb. They get wet in the rain and have
to face a lot of hardship. The are not able to have proper medical
aid also. Dr. Sushila Nayyar gives me the report of their condition.
She gives them four hours every day. There are many pregnant women
among the refugees. Those women have to be delivered, for which some
nurses are required. Also some</p>

medicines and many other things are needed. All these things take
time to arrange. Why are those people living in such a condition? The
Hindus say they have driven them out and they have done nothing wrong
in doing that. They say that they can be brought back provided they
become loyal to the country. I say that they can be brought back only
when their hearts become clean. Granting that the Muslims are not
loyal to the country and they refuse to surrender arms, does it mean
that they should be slaughtered? There are 400 to 450 million Muslims
in India. Out of these, suppose one lakh or even one crore have
hidden arms in their houses. Is your army, your police, not powerful
enough to unearth those arms from their houses? The police does not
belong to the British nowadays. You must realize what would be the
outcome of slaughtering the Muslims, killing their children and their
women. I have already told you that we have fallen. We became an
independent nation on August 15 when we celebrated our Independence
Day. For a few days after that we all lived like brothers. Everything
seemed well at that moment. But today we have forgotten that we are
brothers. If they are killing us, the blame lies with the Muslim
League. There was anger at heart. But in the glow of independence we
forgot that they were our enemies at one time. I witnessed this in
Calcutta. That was the condition all over the country. But that
spirit disappeared later and they were ready to slaughter the Hindus
and the Sikhs and drive them away.</p>

I have already said that along with those two conditions if we add
one more condition, we can carry on our work in peace. That condition
is that we shall not take the law into our hands. It is not up to us
to punish them. We admit that we had lost our senses. I agree that
the Muslim League was the first to be unreasonable. As I have already
said, let us show goodness in a greater measure than they do. But if
we try to compete with them in wickedness, it would bring about our
downfall as well as theirs. If they are doing wrong things our
Government will set it right. If any of our people are in Pakistan,
whether Hindus, Sikhs or Christians, who are in a minority over there
and are not well protected, if they are slaughtered and their
daughters are kidnapped, if they are being deprived of their property
or forcibly converted to Islam, our Government will take up the
matter with Pakistan. Who are we to retaliate? I begin to think that
there are some amongst us who are really murderers. I do not quite
know who they are, but they are definitely there, and are working to
carry out pre- planned murders, arson and forcible occupation of
buildings. I do not</p>

know where they are but if they do these things, that is sure to
bring about our downfall. That is why we have got to admit that it is
foolishness [to retaliate in this manner]. Let us rid ourselves of
that unreasonableness and bring back the people who are there. The
Government has to see that Pakistan requests all those to come back
who have suffered in Pakistan and who have been ruined. And all those
who have their properties in Lahore should get them back. They have
to be returned the houses which have been confiscated. What wonderful
buildings I have seen there? And what about all those educational
institutions for girls? Nowhere in India are there greater
educational facilities than in Lahore. Lahore used to lead in the
field of education. Where is that Lahore today? The Government at
Lahore has played no part nor given any financial aid in building all
those institutions. The people of the Punjab come of a sturdy stock.
They are business-minded and produce wealth. There are great bankers
there who know how to spend money as well as earn it. I have seen all
that with my own eyes. They have built all those buildings, all those
colleges for men and women, and then all those grand hospitals and
they should be returned to them. A whole caravan extending to fifty
miles is moving on. Those people are in a bad state. We stop being
barbarians if we pass on the responsibility of taking
counter-measures to the Government. I have already told you this. I
have received a telegram from the Muslims living abroad.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

ask why people have lost their reason. They say that we should all
live like brothers. They say that even though they are Muslims they
do not wish to fight— Islam does not teach that. I have already
said that you should wake up. And let me tell you that you may or may
not accept what I say, but I do not wish to be a witness to these
things. I do not wish to see such a downfall. My only prayer to God
is that He should take me away before that happens. If the situation
does not improve,  the terrible fire raging in my heart will consume
me. My heart tells me that I shall gain nothing by seeing such a
thing. I tried to sacrifice my life for India’s freedom. I did not
lose my life; but freedom came. But what is the point of remaining
alive to see this happening in the wake of freedom? So I pray to God
day and night that He should take me away. Or He should give me the
power to extinguish this fire.</p>

There are some Hindus too. Somebody assaulted and tried to kill those

members of the group attacked not from the doors, but from small

And let me tell you another thing. When a train arrives five persons
fling a man out of the window as if he were a piece of luggage. He is

hang our heads in shame. I understand Muslims also are accused of
similar crimes. Let the Government demand an explanation for what is

	A Sikh gentleman came to look me up today. He said that somebody had
	remarked to him that it was all right that I had narrated the words
	of Guru Arjun Dev, but what did I have to say about the changes made
	in those words by Guru Govind Singh? History says that Guru Govind
	Singh was a born enemy of the Muslims. But there is no reason to
	believe in any such thing, because the 10th Guru almost repeated the
	words of Guru Arjun Dev. And as for Guru  Nanak, he recognized no
	distinction between the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs. It is all
	the same whether one worships in the temple or says <i>namaaz</i>.
	If a Brahmin offers <i>puja, </i>it does not mean that the person
	belonging to other religion curses God. Instead the Muslims say
	<i>namaaz. Puja </i>and <i>namaaz </i>are one and the same. All
	human  beings are the same, though their languages are different. 
	Guru Govind Singh has said that all human beings are essentially one
	and their manifestations are many. If that is so, I believe that we
	are all one and also many. Though we appear different we are
	essentially one. There are crores of individuals but they have the
	same human nature. Guru Govind Singh has said that there is “the
	same air, the same body, the same word.” Then he says that whether
	called a god or a demon, a Yaksha or a Gandharva or a Turk, they are
	only different forms. That is exactly what Guru Govind Singh says:
	“There are many forms to be seen but in essence they are the
	same.” Words mean the speech. And speech is only one. And the sun
	is one. Can you say that there is one sun for the Muslims and
	another sun for us? It is the same sun for all of us. He says the
	air and water are also the same for everybody. The Ganga as it flows
	does not forbid a Turk from taking its water. Nor do the clouds that
	shower water say that they are bringing water not for the Muslims or
	the Parsis but only for the Hindus. It is not as if the Union
	Government was meant only for the Hindus. That can never happen.
	Whether you mention the Koran or the <i>Gita </i>or the <i>Puranas
	</i>it is all the same. Only the forms are different. If you write
	in Arabic you say it is the Koran. And then you write in Sanskrit or
	in the Devanagari script but if you understand well what is written,
	you will find it is the same thing. So he ends by saying that we are

the gentleman that even if Guru Govind Singh had been an enemy of the
Muslims, it was a wrong thing. In the event of war both the Hindus
and the Muslims died and got wounded. But a sensible disciple of the
Guru Saheb supplied water to the soldiers who were alive. He gave
water to the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs. He said it was the
teaching of Guru Maharaj that there were neither Muslims nor Sikhs
nor Hindus; they were only human beings and whoever needed water had
to be provided. Surely Guru Maharaj did not say that if the wounded
person was a Hindu he should be given medical aid and if he happened
to be a Muslim he should be left unattended? He said that Guruji had
fought against the Muslims. So he did, but he fought against those
Muslims who had abandoned the path of justice, and who had given up
their religion. He was a man given to charity, he was unattached, he
was an incarnation of God. For him there was no question of whether
people belonged or did not belong to him. But there is no doubt that
he did defend himself and he did fight. It would be a mistake on the
part of Sikhs to claim to be non-violent. They keep <i>kirpans </i>.
But Guruji taught that the <i>kirpan </i>is meant for the protection
of the innocent. It is meant to fight against the tyrant who harasses
people. The <i>kirpan </i>is not meant for killing old women. It is
not meant for killing women and children, the innocent who are not
guilty. That is not the function of the <i>kirpan</i>. The <i>kirpan
</i>would be thrust into the belly of one who is guilty whether he is
a Muslim or anybody else or even a Sikh whose guilt has been proved.
The way people pull out their <i>kirpans </i>these days is an act of
barbarism. It would not be wrong to deprive these people of their
<i>kirpans </i>, because they have given up their religion. The Sikhs
have abused the <i>kirpan</i>.</p>

that there can never be an honest Muslim. A Muslim always remains a
worthless fellow. In such a situation, what place do I have in India

performance. To damn crores of human beings for the faults of a few

	I would say that we ought to pay her as much as we were paying
	Suchetabehn. I should have discussed this point but I forgot it. It
	was casually mentioned, I do not remember it. It was only this
	morning that we could have a proper talk but then we talked about
	some spiritual matters. Sushilabehn has talked over the subject with
	Suchetabehn at great length. She has no preference as to where she
	should be lodged as she does not know Wardha so well. If there is
	room enough in Bajajwadi to accommodate her, and if she can also
	have some privacy, I would consider it excellent. If this is not
	possible she could probably be accommodated in the Mahila Ashram or
	Kakawadi. I cannot give any definite advice, you have to think over
	the matter yourself.</p>

	I find satyagraha being carried on in many places in  the  country.
	I really wonder if what people describe as satyagraha is satyagraha
	or <i>duragraha</i>. What is happening in the country is that people
	talk of one thing and act quite to the contrary. Today every
	employee, whether belonging to the Post Office or the Telegraph
	Office, or the Railways or to the Indian States, must examine
	wherever he is trying to offer satyagraha, whether it stands for
	truth or untruth. If it is for untruth, there is no need to offer it
	and if it is for truth it should surely be offered under all
	circumstances. Whatever is done with a selfish motive cannot be
	called satyagraha. That would be like insisting on untruth. I have
	explained quite a few conditions for satyagraha. I have said that
	two things are essential in satyagraha. One is that the point on
	which we insist should be truth and another that our insistence
	should be necessarily non-violent.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
	Those who are carrying on satyagraha today should act with due
	deliberation. If the basic thing is not truth and there is recourse
	to force in pressing for the demand, then it would be well to give
	it up. If the thing is poisonous, if it is <i>duragraha </i>and an
	untruth and if we go on demanding what we possibly cannot get, then
	let me tell you that we cannot remain non-violent in making such a
	demand. This cannot be non-violence, it is only violence. It is 
	impossible  that  anyone should make an unjust demand and at the
	same time claim to be non- violent.</p>

	If I am in charge of the refugee camps I would tell the people
	living in those camps that they must clean their places themselves.
	Should they only play cards and dice and gamble or simply remain
	idle? I know there is not enough food and water for them. But if for
	that reason they start refusing to do any work, they will fall a
	prey to vices. And then there are not just half a dozen persons in
	those camps. Thousands are living in those camps. No one can say
	when they will be able to return to their homes. We shall certainly
	provide food for them; but let them at least do some work to earn

There are plenty of things one can find to do in India. These people
may have been millionaires yesterday; but today they have lost their
millions. Such things happen often in the world. Then it becomes
necessary to begin afresh and start working. If somebody comes and
says that he was once a millionaire and cannot work, all our plans
will be upset. We cannot then succeed. Very respectfully I would like
to say that we cannot proceed that way. Whatever work we carry on
should be ideal from every point of view. It should be clean and
there should be nothing shoddy. Let me tell you that our difficulties
are likely to be solved to a great extent if people do their own
work. And if we get absorbed in our work our anger will also subside.
The desire for revenge in our hearts will also die out. Goodness 
lies  in recognizing evil as evil and then meeting it with goodwill.
Therein lies the good of the country. We will not inflict suffering
on anyone but will try to make others happy by undergoing hardships
ourselves. If we do this, we shall be acting not only for the good of
India but of the world. Today the world is watching how India is
conducting herself. Now is the real moment of our test. We have
attained independence. What are we going to do now?</p>

	How can I convince you that all these things that are happening
	today would not have happened if we had not lost our heads. I have
	no doubt about it at all. Because the Muslims have lost their
	senses, the refugees are fleeing Pakistan. Why should the Hindus
	leave that country if they were comfortable there? Why should they
	run away from West Punjab? It is indeed tragic that people are
	running away from other parts of Pakistan as well. We should give
	thought to why the Hindus are running away. Suppose that the Muslims
	there have become tyrants, should we, in turn, become tyrants too?
	Should we take the law into our hands and kill the young and the
	old, women and children because the Muslims are killing them there?
	I have repeatedly stated that that is the law of the jungle. I
	cannot remain alive while such a law prevails. So far I had been
	praying to God that He may keep me alive for 125 years so that I
	could render some more</p>

Kingdom of God, <i>Ramarajya, </i>prevails in the country. Then only
I can say that India has become truly independent. But today it has
become a mere dream. Let alone <i>Ramarajya, </i>at present there is
no rule whatever in the country. What can a man like me do under
these circumstances? If this situation cannot be improved, my heart
cries out and prays to God, that He should take me away immediately.
Why should I remain a witness to these things? And if He wishes that
I should remain alive, I appeal to Him at least to grant me the
strength I once possessed. I used to take pride that I could convince
the people. Formerly when I went to the people and warned them
against doing something, they listened to me. Such was their love for
me. I would not say that people love me less today. But whether it is
more or less it should be followed by action. And it is action that
is lacking. Hence I would say that my influence is on the wane. My
work went on well while were in bondage. But I am not able to do
anything now when we are independent. I could teach the same lesson
to our people today which I did then. If you can heed that advice
today, we can go very far.</p>

What I wanted to tell you was that for you the days of winter are
coming. As for me, you see this shawl brought by these girls lest I
catch a chill. I have got some cough too. But there is much
improvement and this cotton wrap is sufficient for the time being.
But what about all those refugees in the camps and in the Purana
Quila? You can ask why you should give [blankets] for the Muslims,
but I cannot think that way. For me Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis,
Christians are all the same. I cannot make any distinction. What will
happen to all those people in this winter? If you tell me that it is
the job of  the  Government to give them blankets, I would say that
the Government cannot do so. The Government will make all efforts,
but where is the stock? From where will the Government produce the
blankets? It is not true that it can easily procure them. Today
things are not available even in Europe or in the United States.
Nobody can send us anything from there. Even if someone sends ten or
twenty thousand blankets out of pity, what purpose will be served by
them? We have to provide blankets to lakhs of people. How can
everyone get it? I would like to tell all those who are present here
that it is not proper that all those people should suffer the rigours
of winter. At the same time you cannot pass on all your blankets to
them. But I know there are a number of people among us who have many
more blankets than they</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
need. There are a large number of poor people in Delhi who can hardly
afford to have blankets. Give as many blankets as you can spare. You
can start giving things like this from today. You should not wait and
think that since the Government is doing something you need do
nothing. The cold has already started though it is still  bearable.
But when I had gone to the Viceregal Lodge after [September]<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>17,
I found the fire already ablaze in the fire-place. That was because
it had already become cold and Delhi winter is such that it is more
than one can bear. The cold increases rapidly from October onwards
and becomes severe. November, December, January and February, are the
pleasant months of winter. Those who have plenty to eat and piles of
clothes and who can go about heavily clothed, can wear boots and
socks, can afford to call the winter months pleasant. But I am a
witness to what happens to those who do not have these things. You
too may be a witness to that. Hence I would say that we should try to
save as many of such people as possible. It is possible that those
who have clothes for winter may not have woollen blankets. Even if
there are no woollen blankets there may be at least some quilts. A
thick cotton sheet is good enough. If it is in good shape you can
bring that too. Even a thick, heavy sheet used in olden days, can
serve the purpose. A thick khadi sheet would do. I do not want any
other clothes. It may be a woollen wrap, or a quilt or a thick khadi
sheet—let me have whatever you can easily spare. You must give
these things on your own. If you start sending things, somebody will
be in charge of collecting them. I am not going to take charge of
them personally. Nor will these things rot in the godowns or be
delivered to undeserving persons. I assure you that whatever wraps
and clothes you give will go only to the deserving men and women. I
do hope you will not tell me that you are giving these things for the
Hindus or the Sikhs. Human beings are all one. Let on one come and
tell me later on that these things are not to be given to the
Muslims. A large number of Muslims have been killed here and many
have fled. We have driven them out. I do not know what property
remains in the possession of those who have been left behind. If the
Muslims remaining in India send the blankets to me and insist that
they should be given to the Muslims I will give them to the Muslims.
But I hope that all those who have been hearing my words and are
going to hear me on the radio will not embarrass me. Let them rather
tell me that</p>

they have dedicated those things to God. In that case, they will go
to the deserving people. I hope and trust that you will do this much.
If you do it, I will say that you have done a great thing. But do not
send dirty and torn things that I may have to wash and darn. If the
clothes are dirty, try to wash them before sending. Take that much
trouble. There is no need to send them to the dhobi. You can wash

It is perhaps wrong to describe my present state of mind as
depression. I have but stated a fact. I am not vain enough to think
that the divine purpose can only be fulfilled through me. It is as
likely as not that a fitter instrument will be used to carry it out
and that I was good enough to represent a weak nation, not a strong
one. May it not be that a man purer, more courageous, more far-seeing
is wanted for the final purpose? This is all speculation. No one has
the capacity to judge God. We are drops in that limitless ocean of
mercy.</p>

Without doubt the ideal thing would be neither to wish to live 125
years nor to wish to die now. Mine must be a state of complete
resignation to the Divine Will. The ideal ceases to be that when it
becomes real. All we can do is to make as near an approach to it as
possible. This I am doing with as much energy as I can summon to my
assistance.</p>

I have just received a telegram sent jointly by many persons. The
telegram is lying right before me. I am not happy about the contents
of the telegram. Of course they have every right to send such a
telegram. The senders of the telegram say that if the Hindus had not
behaved the way they did, I too would not have remained alive. This
is a very serious thing. I acknowledge no other power except God that
can keep me alive. I can remain alive as long as He wishes and no one
can kill me till that moment. What is true for me is true for
everybody. Why then should they write such a thing? I must admit that
they have been inspired by love to write what they have written. But
I firmly believe that God alone can keep me or anyone else alive.</p>

Let me tell you today that I meet and keep in touch with the
Ministers. Panditji visits me almost every day. The Sardar also pays

both of them come. They are both my friends and are with me. Both of
them have even differed from me in all earnestness. I do not mean to
say that I shall not be able to tell them anything. The Government
has to protect all—Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians. Then only
can they claim to be true Congressmen. The function of Hindu
Mahasabha is to protect Hinduism. It is their job to protect the
religion of the Sikhs and the Hindus and to overcome the forces of
evil. Who else is going to do it? Can religion ever be saved through
anybody’s favour? If we ask someone to save our religion, we are
only bargaining. We say all this because we want to save ourselves.

Next I want to talk about something else. Mr. Churchill has repeated
his earlier view<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>in
an exaggerated manner. That pains me. That is because I am a friend
of the British. I have no feeling of animosity towards anyone.
Several among the British are very nice people and they have acted
courageously in granting freedom to  India. I don’t care what
result this may have later on. Mr. Churchill assails this action and
says, as he had said in his earlier speech also, that he has always
held the view that the Indians are what they are. If he had known it
all along, where was the need to repeat his view?</p>

that is ruling Britain today. Britain is a small island; but it has
progressed so much on the strength of its working class and
industries that it has become renowned in the world. Mr. Churchill
aspires to overthrow the present Labour Government in that country.
In order to pull down that Government he points out that the Labour
Government has done a foolish thing and behaved in a clumsy manner
and ruined the Empire. He says it is a folly that Britain should have
lost India and now the same thing is going to be repeated in Burma.
How can I tell Mr. Churchill that we are too familiar with British
history, how they acquired Burma and how they consolidated their
power in India. I do not think anyone can be proud of such a history.</p>

What we are doing today is sheer savagery. We are trying to destroy
the freedom we have won. I admit that today I am useless in your
eyes. I have no influence on you. Nevertheless, let me tell you that
if the British people listen to Mr. Churchill’s words and the
Conservative Party defeats the Labour Government it would be a great
misfortune. Let me tell you that the whole world says that we have
become free through some power. What is that power? It was the
working class that was in power at the time Britain had a Socialist
Government and that Government granted us freedom. Who can wipe out
socialism? Neither Mr. Churchill nor anyone else can do so. I have
come to realize that their Government cannot function in any other
way. Supposing the British nation loses its salt and the working
class is defeated and Mr. Churchill comes back to power, would he
gives us an ultimatum that he is going to enslave us again, and
attack us? Let us see how he does it. For the life of me I cannot
think how he can ever do it. The people of our country may be
anything, good or bad; they may become scoundrels or lose their
heads. But they alone have taught me that freedom is the greatest
thing. In such freedom you are entitled to commit all the mistakes.
It is not that freedom is given to us when we are good and may be
taken away from us when we cease to be so. How can one talk like
that? That was not the law for the British people. It was not the law
for the other nations of the world. If freedom was meant only for the
good, looking at the things happening in the world how would one find
freedom anywhere? It is the British themselves who hae taught us that
freedom is preferable to slavery. A British writer has said that the
British would choose to remain free even if they were to just drink
and rot but they would not like to be reformed under slavery. But we
in India accept their bad points and not the good points.</p>

India has seven lakh villages. Today the people of these seven lakh

villages went mad, the map of India would be completely changed. I

I have already told you that even if we continue to be crazy the
British are not going to return. They cannot come back. Once they
have thrown out something, are they going to swallow it back? But the
world is watching all that is happening. How will the world react
when it sees what is happening here? The world will not allow such a
thing to happen to India. Nor will India allow it to happen. But if
other powers under the U. N. O. come her for investigation, we will
not be able to stop them. If then we continue to be mad and lose our

it may completely destroy us if it so wishes, but it can never
enslave us again. It is my vow never to be a slave again. It is for
all of you to adhere to that vow, to make it a reality. I alone
cannot do it. I cannot save India single-handed.</p>

How can I be sure about myself? Who can say how long I am going to be
alive? How is India going to be affected if God takes me away? How
can I save India all by myself? It all depends on God. If He is by my
side and is merciful, India can be saved. I think that so long as I
am alive, nobody can take advantage of the disturbed conditions in
the country and say, let us enslave it and capture it. I only wish
that God may fulfil this desire of mine through you.</p>

There is a fresh exodus of Hindus from East Bengal. What does it
portend? I have taken it that Noakhali will not be reenacted in the
Dacca area. It is said that the Muslims are not allowing the Hindus
to celebrate their festivals with music. Among the Muslims there are
said to be two groups. One group maintains that the Hindus have every
right to do so. The other says they won’t allow it. There is panic
among the Hindus as a result. Write to me in full detail after full

	Those who ought to know all about our food problem have gathered
	together on the invitation of Dr. Rajendra Prasad to give him the
	benefit of their advice on the grave food crisis. Any mistake made
	on this important matter may mean avoidable starvation and death of
	millions therefrom. India is not unfamiliar with starvation and
	death of tens of thousands, if not millions, due to famine, natural
	or man- made. I claim that in a well-ordered society there should
	always be pre-arranged methods of successful treatment of scarcity
	of water and food crops. This is, however, not the occasion for
	describing a well- ordered society and for showing how it would deal
	with the matter. Our concern, for the present, is to see whether we
	can, with a fair hope of success, deal with the present food crisis.</p>

	I think we can. The first lesson we must learn is of self-help and
	self-reliance. If we assimilate this lesson, we shall at once free 
	ourselves from disastrous dependence upon foreign countries and
	ultimate bankruptcy. This is not said in arrogance but as a matter
	of fact. We are not a small country dependent for our food supply
	upon outside help. We are a sub-continent, a nation of nearly 400
	millions. We are a country of mighty rivers and a rich variety of
	agricultural land, with inexhaustible cattle wealth. That our cattle
	give much less milk than we need is entirely our own fault. Our
	cattle wealth is any day capable of giving us all the milk we need.
	Our country, if it had not been neglected during the past few
	centuries, would today not only be providing herself with sufficient
	food, she would also be playing a useful role in supplying the
	outside world with much-  needed food-stuffs of which the late war
	has unfortunately left practically the whole world in want. This
	does not exclude India. The</p>

distress is growing instead of showing signs of decreasing. My
suggestion does not include ungrateful rejection of free supply that
any foreign country may wish to offer us. All I say is that we must
not go begging. It demoralizes. Add to this the difficulty of
internal transport of food-stuffs from one place to another. We have
not the requisite facility for rapid movement of grains and other
food-stuffs from place to place. Further add to this the remote
possibility of delivery of uneatable stuff. We dare not lose sight of
the fact that we have to deal with human nature. In no part of the
world is it to be found perfect or even very nearly so.</p>

Next let us see what possible foreign aid we can get. I am told that
not more than three per cent of our present wants. If this
information is correct, and I have had it checked by several experts
who confirm the figure, I am sure the case for reliance on outside
help falls to the ground. The slightest dependence on outside help is
likely to deflect us from exploring to the fullest extent our immense
internal possibilities in the shape of utilizing every inch of arable
land for growing crops for daily food in the place of growing money
crops. We must reclaim waste land which is capable of being placed
under immediate cultivation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Centralization of food-stuffs, I apprehend, is ruinous. De-
centralization easily deals a blow to black-marketing, saves time and
money in transport to and fro. Moreover the villager who grows 
India’s cereals and pulses knows how to save  his  crops  against
rodents. The movement of grain from station to station makes it
liable to be eaten by rodents. This costs the country many millions
and deprives it of tons of grain, every ounce of which we badly need.
If every Indian were to realize the necessity of growing food
wherever it can be grown, we should most probably forget that there
was scarcity of food-stuffs in the land. I have by no means dealt
fully with the fascinating and absorbing subject of growing more
food, but I hope I have said enough to stimulate interest and turn
the wise towards the thought of how every individual can help in the
laudable enterprise.</p>

Let me now show how to deal with the three per cent of grain we might
possibly get from outside. Hindus observe a fast or a semifast every
eleventh day each fortnight. Muslims and others are not prohibited
from denying themselves, especially when it is for the sake of the
starving millions. If the whole nation realized the beauty of this
partial self-denial, India would more than cover the deficit caused
by</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
the voluntary deprivation of foreign aid.</p>

Personally I hold that rationing has very limited use, if any. If the
producers were left to themselves, they would bring their produce to
the market and everyone would get good and eatable grain, which today
is not easily obtainable.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.04cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I shall close this hurried review of the food crisis by drawing
attention to President Truman’s reported advice to the  American
people that they should eat less bread, and thus save the much-needed
grain for starving Europe. He added that Americans would not lose in
health by the recommended act of self-denial. I tender my
congratulations to President Truman on this philanthropic gesture. I
must decline to endorse the suggestion that at the back of this
philanthropy there is a sordid motive of deriving a pecuniary
advantage for America. A man must be judged by his action, not the
motive prompting it. God alone knows men’s hearts. If  America
would deny herself for the sake of hungry Europe, should we fail to
do this little act of self-denial for ourselves? If many must die of
starvation, let us at least earn the credit of having done our best
in the way of selfhelp, which ennobles a nation.</p>

together will not disperse without presenting a work-able solution of
the food crisis that faces the country.</p>

this place. How would they go away? I find that today the Muslims are
not safe in the trains. Anyone who so pleases throws them out of the
compartments or slaughters them. I understand that a similar thing is
happening in Pakistan. But what are we going to gain by continuing to
behave in this manner? Let us at least know ourselves. Let us at
least recognize our religion. Everyone follows his own religion. What
does our religion teach us? Or are we acting without any regard for
our religion? Has the Congress lost its senses? After all, what did
the Congress do for 60 years? If the Congress has been making a
mistake so far, it is the enemy of the country, and I would say that
it should be removed from the scene. Let even those who profess to be
Congressmen say it in clear terms that they are leaving the Congress
and forming another party. There is no room for any complaint about
it. Do whatever you like but this much I can say before the whole
world and our people that we should not take the law into our own
hands. If we do it, we shall be driving ourselves to ruin and lose
our independence and then, if some other power comes and subjugates
India, we shall realize with shock what a terrible blunder we had
make. This is not a good thing. There was a mongoose which killed a
snake to save a child. Its mouth was smeared red with blood. The
child’s mother had gone to the well to fetch water. When she
returned, the mongoose rushed to her jumping as through saying that
it had saved her child. But she thought it had killed the child and
threw the pitcher on the mongoose. The water was gone, the pitcher
was broken and the mongoose died. When the woman entered the house
she saw the child playing in the cradle and the dead snake lying
nearby. Then she realized that the mongoose had been her friend. She
felt sad and remorseful. So let us not do anything which we may
regret later like that mother, and feel sorry for not having
co-operated with our Government. We have set up our own Government.
Are we going to ruin it?</p>

Jawaharlal is no good. It is said he is not a good Hindu. People want

the religion one may follow, one belongs to India if one is loyal to
the country, and is as much entitled to live in India as I am. It
makes no difference if one belongs to the minority community. That is

that in <i>Ramarajya </i>or the Kingdom of God no person can be
unworthy just because he follows a different religion. You must
realize that I am such a Hindu. I have no power in my hands and I am
not a minister. Jawaharlal is a minister and you can remove him if
you want. Then there is the Sardar. Do you know who he is? He is the
Sardar from Bardoli. Do you listen to him? He also has many Muslim

he is dead. Imam Saheb’s son-in-law<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

married Imam Saheb’s daughter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

from South Africa, leaving his business there, and stayed with me. He
is dead and his grown-up daughter is left behind. Should I discard
her and tell her that I have nothing to do with her becaue she is a
Muslim? She is a Muslim no doubt, but I can say that she is a
good-hearted girl. She does not know that she might have to leave. If
the Sardar lets her go, where is she going to stay? Let us not take
the law into our own hands. Law may be made by the Sardar or
Jawaharlal, but they cannot fist issue ordinances and then leave the
matter to the public. Today we cannot have such ministers. Granted
that that was done during the days of the British. But does it mean
that we should do so even now? Shall we invite the same criticism
about us which we used to fling at the British? We will not tolerate
it. That is all I want to say.</p>

<i>October</i><i> </i><i>8,</i><i> </i><i>1947</i><i> </i>A
	gentleman often comes to see me. He is good man. He was travelling
	from Dehra Dun. The train was quite crowded. At one station (I have
	forgotton the name) a man entered their compartment. All others in
	the compartment were Hindus and Sikhs, some carrying swords and some
	carrying knives. They gave the newcomer a close look. They asked him
	who he was. That poor man was alone and he replied that he was
	<i>chamar. </i>But those people were suspicious. When they examined
	his hand they found his name tattooed there. Sometimes people have
	their names tattooed on their hands. And thus he proved to be a
	Muslim. Somebody drove a knife into his body and as the train
	approached the Jumna he picked him up and flung him into the river.
	The whole thing was done by only one man, but all those other men
	also witnessed it. The gentleman who narrated the incident to me
	could not bear the sight and turned his face away. I told him that
	if he had so much pity in his heart and he did not like the man
	being killed, why did he not stop the offender from doing such a
	savage act? There were some fifty or sixty Hindus and Sikhs in the
	compartment and the victim was a helpless Muslim among them. What
	kind of humanity is it that someone should kill such a lone man and
	throw him in the Jumna? That man was not even completely dead. He
	had been stabbed and wounded and he was just thrown into the river.
	If the gentleman who came to me had so much pity, why did he not
	intervene and why did he not save him from death? He told me that
	though he felt distressed he failed to do his duty. He said he could
	not think of doing anything. I told him that was not a good thing,
	that was not human. We are so many and if a solitary Muslim comes in
	our midst we kill him and throw away his body. Anyone who tries to
	do such a thing shoud be restrained and persuaded with love that he
	should have mercy. He should be told: ‘What are you doing? Whom
	are you killing? Don’t kill him, he has not done anything.’ And
	if this had no effect, I would be happy if  the gentleman had
	sacrificed his life in saving that Muslim. What is so great about
	fifty or sixty persons killing a single man? But there were so many
	people present and one of them decided to kill a man and actually
	killed him while others looked on, who probably approved of</p>

the act. Let me tell you that those who are given to this way  of
thinking are mistaken. In the midst of those who kill there are also
those who do have pity in their hearts and do not approve of killing,
but because they are afriad for their own lives they do nothing and
forget how they should act on such occasions. But how can one forget?
If somebody indulges in an act of savagery, you must stop him. How
very shameful that even the people who do not approve of such
savagery merely look on? I want to tell you this because I have seen
with my own eyes that there are people who do not approve of such
things but do not have the courage to come forward and intervene. I
will appreciate if there is even a single individual who shows the
courage to stand up and prevent such an act saying that he would hold
the hand of the offender if he tries to strike and if the offender
does not listen, would sacrifice his own life, rather than let the
victim be killed. A man like me would stand by non-violence. He would
not kill even if he had to die himself, instead he would save a
person’s life by laying down his own. I have no doubt that that man
would have been saved if somebody had shown such courage. And if, in
an attempt to save, he himself had got killed, he would have proved
himself truly brave. This is true non-violence. True non-violence
does not mean that we remain non-violent before the strong and use
force on the weak.</p>

We used non-violence against the British, but now we are resorting to
violence. Against whom are we using violence? Against our own
fellowmen. The non-violence we used against the British was not the
non-violence of the brave. The country is facing the consequences
now. I am facing the consequences. So are you. I must admit that I
could not teach you true non-violence. I am showing you what the
non-violence of the brave can be. There are Muslims living here
today. And there in Pakistan the Muslims are ill-treating the Hindus.
But shoud we, in turn, ill-treat tthe Muslims? Are they behaving
particularly like brave people? Let me tell you that what is
happening in Pakistan is deplorable, and if we are going to follow it
in our Union it is equally deplorable. And then arguing about which
side was the first to take the offensive and which committed more
excesses than the other is not exactly the way of establishing
friendship. The true way of friendship is that we should always be on
the side of justice and maintain our good behaviour. If we follow
that path, even the savage and those who may have lost their senses
will come round. We don’t want to go into the question of who is
more guilty and who</p>

less, or who started it. In my view that would be sheer ignorance.
That is not the way of becoming friends. If those who were enemies
till yesterday want to be friends today, they should forget the past
enmity and start behaving as friends. What is the point of
remembering animosity? There can be no friendship if people think
that they would be prepared to fight if necessary but would remain
friends if they could. That is not how true friendship grows.</p>

Now I may as well talk a little about another point. The Press has
become a very powerful medium in the world today. When a country
bccomes independent the Press becomes all the more powerful. When
there is freedom, there can be no restrictions on the Press regarding
the reports and the news to be published. But public opinion can be
very useful at such times. When the newspapers do dirty propaganda or
publish unfounded reports or incite people, the Government should
come down on them to put an end to these or take legal action against
them. But in doing so the riot situation worsens and there is more
trouble. The Government cannot resort to that course. Things were
different during the days of the British. What did they care? They
caught hold of a man like Tilak<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
put him behind the bars for six years. He had written something in
his paper. It was nothing much. Still he got six years’ deportation
and had to complete the entire term. Like him many people had to go
to Jail. I was also jailed for six years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>It
is another matter that I did not remain in jail for six years. But I
was sentenced to six years because of an article I wrote in <i>Young
</i><i>India. </i>I did not write anything bad, but I was sentenced.
Now such thing cannot happen when we are free. Today all the
correspondents, editors and owners of newspapers must become truthful
and serve the people. No false information should appear in the
newspapers nor should they publish anything that would incite the
people. Today, when we have become independent, it is the duty of the
public not to read dirty papers but to throw them away. When nobody
buys those papers they will automatically follow the right path. I
feel ashamed at the fact that today people have got into the habit of
reading dirty and undesirable things. Such newspapers are widely
circulated. I  read about an incident at Rewari. A newspaper
published a report saying</p>

whether he had written that story on wrong information or it was
deliberate mischief. He is guilty of great crime before God. Such a

can never progress. The Government cannot keep a watchful eye on the
Press today. You and I should keep a watch on the newspapers. Let us
purify our hearts and show no inclination to take in dirty things.

Our military and police also are in the same position as the Press.
The military and the police were divided at the time of the
Partition. I admit that it was not their doing. It just happened like
that. The military here is composed of Hindus and Sikhs. The Muslim
soldiers have gone over to Pakistan. If the Hindu and Sikh soldiers
and police start thinking that because they themselves are Hindus and
Sikhs they will only defend the Hindus and Sikhs and try to cover up
the crimes committed by them and refuse to protect the Muslims
because they are not meant to protect them, we shall be nowhere. Nor
would it be any good if the Muslim army and the police started
killing the Hindus saying it was not their business to protect the
Hindus. The Government has the military and the police. But I need
neither the military nor the police. I would ask the people  the 
become  the military and the police for us. If the Hindus kill the
Muslims here they have got to be saved. We must not give up. I shall
not step aside even if I have to lay down my life. Such will be my
Government. I am not talking in the air. I am telling you what is
right. I would like to say the same thing to the army and the police
which belong to  the Government. Their primary duty is to protect the
handful of Muslims living here. If they are attacked by the Hindus
and Sikhs, they should come to their rescue. They should protect them
even at the risk of their own lives. Then only can they be called
true soldiers and policemen. The freedom achieved by India is indeed
a remarkable phenomenon. The whole world says and I say it too that
no</p>

government has ever transferred power to the people of any other
country in this way. We have attained our independence without any
fighting and bloodshed. Hence our military and police should not be
there to fill their pockets. They should be content with what they
are getting. They should not think in terms of extravagant meals
complete with sweets. A soldier must satisfy his hunger with whatever
meagre meal he may be getting and perform his duty. But if he starts
thinking about other people’s children going to schools and
colleges,  and about their cars and cycles and decides to resort to
corrupt means to get similar thing for himself, he will cease to be a
true servant. That is why I say that a true soldier and a true
policeman is the one who is satisfied with whatever food he gets and
does his duty without any religious bias. If he is a Hindu he should
never think of harming the Muslims. It is a different thing to
apprehend a Muslim and have him punished if he is guilty of a crime.
But should an innocent Muslim be punished here because the Muslims
elsewhere are guilty of grave crimes? If a Hindu harms a Muslim, it
is the duty of a policeman to protect the Muslim. I must say that a
policeman who acts in this manner is true to the Indian salt. If our
military and police do not behave thus, they are not true to the salt
of their country.</p>

I will say the same thing about the military and the police in
Pakistan. But I can do nothing about the situation there. To whom
should I address my words? But I have no doubt that if things happen
here as I have suggested, similar developments are bound to take
place there. Today the people have lost their balance. They say, when
their own brethren are being ill-treated in Pakistan, why should they
not retaliate here? But it is not human to say such a thing. Hence so
long as I am alive I shall proclaim at the top of my voice that we
must keep ourselves pure, we must be good, our newspapers and our
military and police should remain good. Without this our Government
cannot function and we shall be ruined. We must remain civilized,
whatever happens in Pakistan. Even if they turn mad, we have to
remain good. So, under any circumstances, we have to remain
civilized. Do at least this much. If you do not listen to me, let me
tell you that we are all going to be ruined.</p>

and women. I could do it only with the help of Ramanama. While
reciting the name of God if somebody kills us, let us be killed. Why
should we be so much attached to life? Should we give up Ramanama for
the sake of remaining alive? Should we give up the name of God out of
fear? Should the women who are accustomed  to  putting <i>kumkum
</i>marks, stop doing so? Women in that region, if they are not
widowed, wear bangles of shell. That is a symbol of their married
status. Widows do not wear bangles. Should they, out of fear, give up
wearing bangles even when they are not widowed? When I found those
women hesitating to wear the shell-bangles as an auspicious mark, I
persuaded them that they should not discard their bangles. They were
convinced and assured me that they would  wear  the bangles again.
Now I hear that people are slowly coming away. I did not know about
it. My own people are there. Perhaps I have told you that all my good
co-workers are there. Pyarelal, people from  the  Khadi Pratishthan,
Kanu Gandhi—are all there. Many capable persons, including Satis
Chandra, are there. They are all trying to build up the morale of
those people. In spite of that people  are running away from there.
No doubt they must be facing many hardships there. But what is the
point in running away form there? Where will they run away and what
will they do? Let them consider this point. Here in Kurukshetra we
have 25,000 refugee men and women. Some women are pregnant. It is no
wonder that some of them die, because, in any case, who is there to
treat and nurse them? There is no accommodation and people feel
distressed for they had to flee from the Punjab. I am therefore
thinking what advice I should give them. The number of refugees who
are still there is much larger than those who have arrived. We can
convince them and take care of them if they are in tens or twenties,
or even some lakhs. But their number goes into several crores and
they are spread over this vast country. It is not a small matter
transferring these people from one  place  to another. They are
facing such hardships that they die before their time and are starved
to death. The Government cannot provide everything to everybody even
if it tries hard. The Government has its military and police forces.
But all these cannot be used as they were during the British days.
Nor should it be so. The army can carry on its functions only with
the help of the people. If the people wish, they can be the hands and
the feet of the Government. The Government cannot do anything unless
the people co-operate with it. I am telling this to the Ministers
also. As I see, the Government is not shirking the</p>

responsibility. I meet the Ministers almost every day. Let me tell
you that they too are upset and disturbed. But what could they do?
After all, they have no experience of running a government. They ran
the Congress organization. But it was only an organization of a
handful of people. All the persons whose names were on the Congress
register never gathered together. And the workers in the office were
small in number. They had to work with limited resources. Today they
have to work for crores of people. Crores of rupees are there and
thousands and thousands of people have to be looked after by a few
officials.</p>

How can the work be done? It is to be considered how these 25,000
people can get their food in time. Thousands of people come into the
country daily, and they remain hungry. They do not have enough
clothes to wear and the winter is round the corner.  The situation in
Pakistan is the same as here. It is not as if it was heaven for
people in Pakistan and hell for those who are here. Or, one may even
say that it is not as if it was heaven here. I see this with my own
eyes. Nor can it be said that it is all hell in Pakistan. After all,
there are human beings living in both the countries. Some of them are
good and some are wicked. But who would determine how much goodness
and how much wickedness exists there and here? And what would we gain
by it? The greatest question before me is, and it should also be the
question before you, that of giving all possible protection to the
people who have already come or want to come. But with regard to
those who have come we should try and see that they return to their
homes. Let me tell you that they must go back to their homes. I know
that those who were living in villages will not like to leave their
places. Even if a villager owns an acre of land, he will make any
sacrifice to preserve it. If people migrate by thousands and
millions, where can they be accommodated and how can they live? They
are dying on the way. That is why I say that even if we have to die,
we should continue to live wherever we are. We shall see what happens
later on. It is not as  if God will not protect us if we live in
Pakistan. God is always there to take care of us. And then, there is
the Government to take care of us even if there is no one else.</p>

I just mentioned that all my co-workers are in Bengal. Let the West

frown used to frighten them have already gone. Now what has happened?
I am a witness to their being afraid of the British. But now if

he is his own general and police, that he has attained freedom and he

If both the Governments are anxious to do justice, that will
encourage [the people] to do something. But what will happen if the
Governments do not wish to do justice? What will be the outcome after
all? I am not a man keen on fighting. I may run away from fighting.
But those who have weapons, the police and the army, will naturally
want to fight. What else can they do? I can do nothing. But those who
can do something must necessarily do what they want to do. Then there
will have to be a war. People who share my creed, wherever they are,
cannot go on living in distress. We shall have to do something. This
I am saying with regard to both the Governments. It is for both to do
something. One who is a tyrant has no right to punish another tyrant.
When a Government does not or cannot protect its people well, how can
it challenge another Government for the same fault? How can anyone
ever do such a thing? I can understand if we die fighting for justice
and our Government has to go in the process. But should we run away
form there out of fear and die as we flee? Half the people die on the
way and the remaining reach here. But where to accommodate them? How
are we going to feed them? Should they simply stay here doing
nothing? If not, they will have to be provided with jobs. When crores
in our country are starving and crores are unemployed and we are able
to do nothing about them, how are we going to find jobs for those who
are coming from outside, not from outside the country but from
another province? How will they find their own occupation here? What
will they do and how? That is a great problem which creates ill
feeling. This ill feeling wil not be there if my suggestion is
accepted. Then people will become courageous. They will master the
art of dying. If they learn the art of dying, they will be doing good
to us and the world. If we can convince India about the solution I
have suggested it will be to the benefit of all. If we become brave,
I have no doubt that the whole world will admire us.</p>

should go on issuing permits for whatever quantity of foodgrain can
be provided. But my suggestion is absolutely practical. And what is
there to be upset about it? India is vast country inhabited by
hundreds of thousands of people. We have got sufficient land, and by
the grace of God, sufficient water. I know there are certain desert
areas in the country where water is not available. But it cannot be
said that water is not available anywhere in India. When we have so
much water, land and a population of millions why should we be

All I want to say is that people should realize that they have got to
produce foodgrain by their own labour to satisfy their hunger. That
would electrify the atmosphere and that zeal alone would solve half
the problem. It is said, and rightly, that people die more through
fear of death than by real death. There was a man who started
thinking that he was going to die very soon. Why talk of some other
man—take my own example. If I started thinking that I was going to
die because I had a cough, what would happen? I shall die only when
my time is up. That is in the hands of God. But if I start worrying
about it right from now imagining myself on the point of death, it is
dying without actual death. And being in such panic about death daily
I would be creating trouble for people around me as well as for
myself, and would be squeezing myself out day after day. I would be
always lamenting about the approaching death. The better thing would
be to take it easy till the moment of death and convince ourselves
that there is no one who can kill us except God. He will take us away
whenever it pleases Him. If we give up the fear of death our problems
will also leave us, and we will be free of our troubles. I tell you,
when we do this we shall not be troubled. Nobody should think of
getting food through anybody’s favour. Instead we shoud produce our
food by our own labour. That is why I say that we should not die
except by natural death. Let us give up this business of issuing
permits and rationing which is the method of killing unnaturally.
This much with regard to the food problem.</p>

The same is true about cloth. I have already said that we can have
four times more cloth than is available now. Why should there be
shortage of cloth in our country? I am absolutely certain that there
should be no shortage of cloth in India even if there may be some
shortage of food. Why? Because India grows much more cotton than it
needs. There are many people in India who can spin and weave cloth
for their own requirements, and easily wear clothes made by</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
themselves. And thus we become truly independent as regards food and
cloth and then do not have to depend on mills. At present we are not
free in this sense, and if it is so, it is the result of our own
ignorance. I had hoped that we would achieve such self-sufficiency.
Those days are gone when I used to go round the country propagating
khadi. I used to ask women to spin as much as they could. And they
did spin, but it was without realizing its implications. They were
not bothered about the wages. They spun and produced cloth. But now
the picture is different. Today you do not have cloth. I say that we
should produce cotton for our cloth, spin it and get it woven. There
is no trouble weaving cloth for one’s own requirements. But even if
people don’t do that they can certainly buy cloth from a shop. The
Government can buy cloth from the mills and then distribute it to the
people. Apart from this, those who can manage should take a vow not
to buy cloth for a month or two. Let them buy khadi for their use and
avoid buying chintz and cloth of fine varieties. When we don’t buy
cloth for a certain period, it does not mean that we will go naked.
If we produce enough khadi in the meantime, we shall have solved the
problem of protecting ourselves in winter. Here it is not the
question of making blankets and such other things. The question is
only of making enough khadi cloth for our personal use, and not
buying from the market. If we do this much, prices will at once come
down. Today prices of cloth have also gone up. Prices of all
commodities are going up. But we do need some yards of cloth to make
shirts, <i>kurtas </i>and other things. Let us buy khadi cloth for
that purpose. As I have already said the ideas thing would be to
produce that much cloth ourselves. Let us decide not go to the shops.
If we take a vow not to buy any cloth for a few months, let me tell
you that the trouble will be over and we will be self-sufficient in
the matter of clothing and food. Another advantage in my view is that
it gives a feeling of self-confidence to the people and they become
self-reliant and cease to be worried by shortage of cloth. They feel
confident that they can produce their own clothing and their own
food. If we do all this, the result can be great. We have become
free, but only politically. The economic condition of crores of our
people has not improved. But we do not realize this. We will realize
it when we know that we are producing our own food and demand any
price for it we want. We shall know it when we produce enough cloth
to meet our needs. We have got enough cotton. We can even procure it
from the mills. We should realize that it is not possible to have all

Today we are engaged in fighting among ourselves; but we can fight
only when we have time to fight. But when we are occupied in work and
all of us become workers, we will have no time left for quarrels and
fights. We have got provision for food and clothing. Let us give up
the habits of drinking and gambling. If we proceeded thus step by
step in the right direction we would have no shortcomings left in us.
We would on our feel that we do not want to fight. There would be no
question of anyone being a Hindu or a Muslim. If anyone created
trouble we would face it bravely. We would fight with him if we
wanted to. But why should we die today under unnatural circumstances?</p>

I am glad that finally you had to come to the conclusion that the

I do believe that we should hurry up with the reorganization of
linguistic provinces. But the atmosphere here is so vitiated that no
work can be done speedily. I am vigilant all the same. There may be
an illusion for the time being that different languages stand for
different cultures, but there is also the possibility that wih the
establishment of linguistic provinces it may disappear. I shall write
something [about it] if I get the time. Here again, I believe, we are
not going to gain anything by rushing through it. I am not unaware
that a class of people have been saying that linguistic provinces are
wrong. In my opinion, this class takes delight in creating obstacles.

If the Hindustani Prachar Sabha had any source of income, it would
have been its undoing. Either the institution has public utility or
it hasn’t. If it has, the pubic should support it. Many instances
can be cited to prove that whenever such institutions possessed funds
of their own the very purpose of the institution was defeated. The

As long as I was in South Africa I did not  know  that  my birthday
was important. When I came here the nuisance started. But I was lucky
as the spinning-wheel was associated with it and that is how <i>Rentia
Baras </i>came to be celebrated. These days the spinning-wheel is
getting out of date. It is an emblem of ahimsa though nowadays it is
very difficult to have even a glimpse of ahimsa anywhere. That is why
I wonder why we should celebrate <i>Rentia Jayanti</i>. But it is in
man’s nature to go on trying. So I let people do so. I hope the
Gujaratis wherever they are will work for ahimsa. But it is doubtful
whether they will spin. It was after much effort that Gujarat has
accepted khadi. Personally I wish that there is no foreign cloth in
Gujarat and not even</p>

I have been told here that Gujarati children are taught Hindi also.
Gujaratis have welcomed Hindi and many of them sit for examinations
also. Hindi, that is, Hindustani, in the Nagari and Urdu scripts, can
be easily understood. Punjabis will use only Urdu and those who do
not know Urdu will use Sanskritized Hindi. That is why  I showed the
middle course of Hindustani. Learn both the scripts. Keep in mind
that the villagers will not be able to follow Sanskritized or
Persianized language, and you will be committing no sin at any rate
by adopting Hindustani.</p>

birthday was celebrated on October 2. But for the past many years my
birthday has been celebrated according to the Hindu calendar also and
the days in between are utilized for plying the charkha with great
zeal. But today I do not find the atmosphere for it. Even so, if by
the grace of God some regard the charkha as a symbol of non-violence
it would indeed be good. It would be gratifying if even five persons
take it as such, and still better if a crore do so. But even if there
is one such person it will be good. That is why I have drawn your
attention to it.</p>

There is Mandal Saheb in Karachi who is a Minister in the Pakistan
Cabinet. It is said that he is a Harijan from Bengal, but the
Qaid-e-Azam has given him a place in the Cabinet. On his suggestion
something was accepted. Some two or three others whose names I have
forgotten also support his view. It is not possible for all the
others to be with him. But what does it matter if even one or two are
supporting him? A circular has been issued that all the Harijans in
Sind should wear a badge round their arms, with the words indicating
that they are untouchables, so that no one should harass them and
throw them out. According to me the logical result of this would be
(it would be fine if it was only my suspicion) that all those
Harijans would for the present get employment, but later on if they
stayed on there (all of them are not going to stay there; some have
already left and some are going to leave, according to reports I have
received from many letters) they would have to embrace Islam
ultimately. If this is to be the result, it would be a dangerous
situation. If any person wants to give up his religion and accept
some other religion and thinks he is doing a good thing, he is
entitled to do so. Today I regard myself a sanatani Hindu. Tomorrow
if I start disliking  sanatana  dharma I am free to give it up. But
this is a very serious matter. Who can stop me if I do not accept my
religion? I am not tempted to become a Christian in order to improve
my economic condition or gain some other advantage. I will have
settled my accounts with God and would act in accordance with my
conscience even if the world protests. I believe that no Harijan has
any such conviction. I can say this with authority because I have
become a Harijan, an untouchable, and I have accepted their religion.
I expect that as far as the Harijans and others in Pakistan are
concerned, it should be declared that they are safe. Then there would
be no need for anyone to put on a badge.  It should be declared in
respect of all that, even if any individual says he has changed his
religion of his own accord, his conversion will not be considered
valid. Religion is a matter of the heart. It is between a</p>

man and his God. But under the present Government in Pakistan no one
can claim that he has changed his religion of his own free will. It
is understood that anyone doing so has done it from fear or
compulsion. That is why the Pakistan Government has to declare that
there can be no conversion.</p>

Then there is one more thing. There are going to be two  festivals
this month. One is Dussehra, which is a great festival. The Hindus
all over India celebrate this and attach great importance to it. But
it has a greater significance in Bengal. I know this since I have
stayed in Bengal. Exactly two days after this, comes Bakr-Id.  In
former times there was not so much ill feeling amongst Hindus and
Muslims. They did not fight as they do now, though there used to be
some mutual bickering. Even the British Government had to be prepared
in case something untoward happened on that day and Hindus and
Muslims clashed. Any provocation was possible, like slaughtering the
cow or taking the decorated cow in procession to provoke the Hindus.
On the Dussehra Day everything is decorated, music is played and men
and women wear gay dresses, some go in carts and some ride horses.
But it can be a provocation for  the Muslims and provide a ground for
clash and then the Bakr-Id Day would similarly provide a ground to
the Hindus. I would say that those Hindus and Muslims who wish to
live together as friends are duty bound to exercise restraint when
they celebrate these festivals. They should do nothing that may
provoke the other  side.  Even without that our hearts are full of
anger at present and our reactions are exaggerated. Under these
circumstances, we should  not  do anything provocative.</p>

While departing the British Government has done one thing wrong. They
divided the country and now there are two Governments. Today they are
like enemies. Maybe they will never fight. But events are following
such a course that it is difficult to predict about the future. But
let us hope that sanity will prevail on both the sides. But if this
does not happen we may lose our independence. Letting the country be
enslaved will be betraying one’s religion. It would be a grave
mistake to surrender our freedom. It is my prayer that God may grant
wisdom to all of us and all of us should be purified. That would be a
good thing. One more thing I would like to say is that our countrymen
in South Africa may be careful when they carry out their</p>

do not believe in any pure love; the so-called love is nothing but
sex. If there were anything like pure love, I should have felt more
attachment for my parents than for my wife; but the reverse was the
case. I have been a loyal husband but I could not have assured my
wife that I would love her even after her death. My feeling would
perhaps arise from the inconvenience that her passing away might

The first is well stated. Carnal desire was the reality, nationalism
was the fashion of the day. Nationalism in the sense of power
politics is quite consistent with satisfaction of carnal desire.
Instances from life can be multiplied. I have in mind nationalism in
the sense  of a  burning love for the nation including the poorest.
It must burn as it always has burnt carnal desire and the like. Thus
there is no conflict but always victory of the latter over the
former. All-embracing love of the nation leaves not a minute for any
occupation that interferes with that ruling pursuit. He is lost who
is possessed by carnal desire.</p>

Uncertain faith in God and the future springs from the lust for life.
This lust unhinges a man or a woman. Indecision consumes him or her.
Faith in God will live when the animal passion dies. The two cannot
co-exist.</p>

The third enigma is a mere restatement of the first. Undefiled love
between husband and wife takes one nearer God than any other love.
When sex is mixed with undefiled love, it takes one away from one’s
Maker. Hence, if there be no sex consciousness and sexual contact, it
is a question whether there is any occasion for marriage. The pupil
truly says that there was no unselfish love felt for his wife. Had it
been unselfish, death of life’s partner would have enriched life
for, the memory of the disembodied partner would have resulted in
greater dedication to the service of down-trodden humanity.</p>

	Today also quite a few blankets have been received. As for the

	Those quilts too will be arriving. From the way blankets and quilts
	are  coming, I have started hoping that the people who have been put
	here, that is, in Delhi and its neighbourhood, will have no trouble
	during winter. Arrangements are also being made to reach blankets,
	quilts and warm clothing to the needy. One thing should be
	remembered that the blankets that are being received will wear out
	in the end, but just now they can give protection against rain and
	dew. But the trouble with the quilts is that it will not be possible

be enough tents to accommodate all. I had mentioned one thing while
talking to some people, and I want to mention it here too. Those who
get the quilts can protect themselves against the dew if they spread
newspapers on the quilts. Then the dew will not pass through. Another
remarkable thing about the quilts is that the amount of cotton used
for making them gives sufficient warmth. When cotton breaks and forms
into lumps the quilt can be opened up, the cover washed and the
cotton used again after carding. With this the quilt becomes a new
piece. It is a very useful thing for those who use it carefully.</p>

A great calamity has befallen us. But those who think of God and work
in the name of God find something to learn even from such  a
calamity. Two things are possible. One thing is that a person gets
panicky or becomes enraged in the face of a calamity, and makes
himself more miserable. But even in the midst of trouble if he thinks
that he is having trouble for no fault of his own and yet he is never
going to give up God and is always going to seek His help, he can
create for himself happiness even in the midst of misery. Many of the
people who have come as refugees here were well-to-do. They had lots
of money and other property. They had big mansions, now all lost and
gone. I have already said that till the people who have left their
homes go back and are able to live in safety they will be a great
burden on both the Governments. If we want to survive, if we want to
remain free, we shall have to atone for the sin of this exchange of
population. Atonement means making amends for our mistakes. Then only
would it be true expiation. It cannot be done in any other way. When
somebody really rectifies the mistakes he may have committed, he has
done sufficient expiation. If we mean to correct our mistakes, then
the people who have come here to save their lives must be in a
position to go back. This may happen when the time comes, but what
will you do in the meantime? I wish to suggest that in the meantime
if good doctors are available—among the refugees there are doctors,
lawyers and many others—they should give medical service and those
under them also do the same, they can render really great service and
even from these troubled times we can learn a new lesson.</p>

When I went to visit the refugees I was told that 75 per cent of them
were businessmen. It was a shock to me and I wondered how so many
traders would be able to do their business here. Millions of traders
have arrived here and if all of them start doing business all at
once, everything will be in a mess. If they decide to put in some
effort, learn to do something new, then it will be somegwhat better.
Let those</p>

traders who were earlier engaged in business forget their past. It is
a rule in the world that when we cannot get one particular thing, we
must look for something else. Let us not sit idle, or waste time in
gambling and drinking. We have got to do some work. le us work hard.
Those who are businessmen but are ablebodied and can use their hands
and feet should do some work. There are quite a few jobs that do not
require any particular training. Let them concentrate on such things
and co-operate with one another. At the same time let them develop an
attitude of working together. Then out of this hellish situation
which has been created for us, we shall be able to create heaven.</p>

I had decided to tell you about all this and thought that today I
would explain everything in detail and through you convey it to
everyone. The refugees and also the country would derive  great
benefit from it. And then, out of the misery that has befallen us we
shall create happiness.</p>

In this connection I want to say what we should do about the quilts
we have not yet received but are going to get from various places.
What shall we do about them? The cloth used in the quilts can be
removed and washed if it has become dirty. The cotton can be kept
back. Cotton does not get spoilt at all. It can be dried and cleaned
with hand. We do not even need a carding-bow. It is another matter if
we want to use that cotton for spinning. That cotton can be easily
used for making new mattresses or quilts. I think if we make these
things ourselves, they will be made cheaper and quicker. There is
enough cloth lying with the mills. I do not wish to discuss the food
problem at this stage. There is enough stock of cotton out of which
quilts can be made in a short time. If these quilts are given to the
people they would have protection in winter. These people must be
taught how to prepare these things and given hope in the midst of
despair which surrounds them. There is a <i>bhajan </i>which says
that hope springs from unending despair. This is true. It is a poetic
expression. We desire to have a glimpse of hope concealed in the
deepest despair. What should we do to have that glimpse? The people
who have been thrown on the streets must first realize that they
belong to India, not to the Punjab or the North-West Frontier
Province or Sind. All those provinces are in India and so the people
from those parts also belong to India. They can become and remain
Indians only on the condition that they are not a burden on others.
Just as milk becomes sweet when you add sugar to it and then you
cannot separate sugar from the milk and the milk</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
remains what it was, they too should mix and mingle with people
wherever they go like sugar in milk and not quarel or nurse hatred
towards each other. They must be mutually helpful and co-operative
and put in hard work. Then they can reform the province where they go
and the people belonging to that province will say that they are
willing to accommodate any number of such persons.</p>

It is my hope that those among the refugees who are able to work and
whom my voice can reach must persuade others to be good men. They
should not be a burden anywhere but should live, as I have said, in
amity and mutual adjustment. They should not cheat anyone. We should
not waste our time. Let every moment of our time be dedicated to God,
work and service. We were born to serve. If we live like this, we
will forget that we were once plunged in misery and sorrow. There are
millions of people around. Let them engage themselves in service. We
were born to render service. Let us resolve to raise our country
high, not bring it down. I think it will be a blessed moment when we
realize this and then there will be no need to worry about anything.
We may make mistakes. To err is human. But it is also human to
correct the errors. When we rectify our mistakes, we become truly
human.</p>

	Yesterday I made some remarks about the refugee camps which were
	missed in the English condensation. Let me extend them this evening
	as I attach great importance to them. Though we have our fairs,
	religious and other, and have our Congress sessions and conferences,
	as a people we are not accustomed to camp life strictly so called. I
	have attended many Congress sessions, conferences,  and  other
	camps. I attended the Kumbh Mela of 1915 at Hardwar and had the
	privilege of serving in the Servants of India Camp together with my
	co-workers who had returned from South Africa. Though I have nothing
	to record except kind personal attention to me and mine, my
	observation of the camp life our people lived is none too happy. We
	lack the sense of social hygiene, the result being  dangerous
	insanitation and dirt with the attendant risk of outbreak of
	infectious and contagious diseases. Our latrines are generally
	beyond description. Absence of this class of provision is perhaps an
	apt description. People think that they can perform these functions
	anywhere not excluding even the much-frequented banks  of the sacred
	rivers. Spitting anywhere without the slightest consideration for
	the neighbours is almost accepted as a right. Nor are our cooking
	arrangements any better. Flies are everywhere welcome companions. We
	forget that they might have sat a moment ago on any kind of dirt and
	thus might have become easy carriers of infection. Accomm- odation
	is not always planned. This is not an exaggerated picture. I must
	not omit the babble of noise one has to tolerate in these camps.</p>

	For method, planning and almost perfect sanitation, give me a
	military camp. I have never recognized the necessity of the

	it. It gives valuable lessons in discipline corporate existence,
	sanitation, and an exact time-table containing provision for every
	useful activity. There is almost pindrop silence in such camps. It
	is a city under canvas brought into being inside of a few hours. I

These camps become quite inexpensive provided that all work including
the building up of this canvas city is done by the refugees who are
their own sweepers, cleaners, road-makers, trench-diggers, cooks,
washermen. No work is too low for them. Every variety of work
connected with the camp is eqaully dignified. Careful and enlightened
supervision can bring about the desirable and necessary revolution in
social life. Then indeed the present calamity would be turned into a
blessing in disguise. Then no refugee will become a burden wherever
he goes. He will never think of himself alone, but always think of
the whole of his fellow-sufferers and never want for himself what his
fellows cannot have. This is not to be done by brooding but by prompt
action under wise supervision and guidance.</p>

	Today also many blankets have been received. There is an institution
	called the Arya Kanya Vidyalaya here. Two teachers and some students
	from that institution came today. They have collected money to buy
	blankets. How much could they have collected? They got a few
	blankets. But they told me something which I thought was a great
	thing and I was happy when they started talking about keeping a
	fast. I told them that every lunar month has two halves, the bright
	fortnight and the dark fortnight. If they fix one day in each
	fortnight and keep a fast on that day, we shall be saving all the
	food that we get from outside. I consider it a grave mistake to
	spend money and get food from outside. By observing such fasts we
	save ourselves from making such a mistake. After they heard my
	suggestion the teachers of the Vidyalaya had a consultation with the
	girls. They did  not compel anyone. But they decided to keep a fast
	on every Thursday and give in charity whatever they would be saving
	thereby. They would try to give whatever they were able to save.
	They also said that they would grow food on some land they had. They
	have taken upon themselves two tasks—to eat less and grow more
	food. I appreciated this much more than the blankets that have come
	from them. They were followed by the Ambassador of Iran and his
	wife. They sat for a little while but left behind a big pile of
	blankets. They wanted me to distribute the blankets if I could. I
	told them I was a beggar and would</p>

Many Sikh gentlemen came to me. They came in two or three groups. I
discussed many things with them. There is no point  in telling you
what I discussed. There was nothing secret about it. But the gist of
my discussion which they and all others should well understand is
that we are going to achieve nothing by indulging in such mutual
fights. Passing judgments, giving punishment, acting in retaliation
and so on are the things to be done by the Government. Let us  do 
whatever we can through the Government. I think they were all in
agreement with this. The rest of the discussion I shall leave out.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
Then I heard another thing. Some people have been arrested. We are
having our own Government and if it arrests some people it is free to
do so. Quite often it is possible that innocent people get arrested.
Our Government should not deliberately make the mistake of arresting
innocent persons. Nor should it arrest anyone wilfully. But whatever
we may do, a human being is a human being after all. He is prone to
make mistakes. He is no angel. And he is certainly no God. So he is
bound to make mistakes. If by mistake some innocent persons were
arrested, what was the need to launch an agitation? But I hear there
is some agitation going on against the arrest of some innocent
persons. It is for the Government to decide whether or not those
persons are guilty. I can understand if some evidence is placed
before the Government to establish the innocence of a particular
person. But harassing the Government in this manner, getting somebody
released by resorting to agitation, is not the proper thing to do.
When we fought against British imperialism and were jailed we used to
demand the release of the prisoners saying that they were not guilty.
That was indeed true. But they were guilty in the eyes of the
Government, not ours. In those days we agitated against the British
in protest against the arrest of our leaders. But against whom should
we agitate now? Our Government in effect is a Panchayat Raj. The
leaders represent the Panchayat. It is we who have made them leaders.
That is why I say this is not the time to intimidate our Government 
by resorting to agitations. First and foremost, it is our own
Government. It does not have the military strength which the British
used to have in India. The British had the entire Navy at their
command, because of which it used to be said that they were
invincible and unrivalled. It is another matter if that claim cannot
hold good today. Whatever it is, they had everything at their
command. By dint of that force they</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.04cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
ruled over us. Now we are our own rulers. If we know that no other
power is ruling over us and those who are ruling over us have been
elected by us, we can also remove them. That is why I say that we
should not take such an agitational approach.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The next thing I want to mention, about which I have already told you
a number of times, is how we can establish perfect peace in India. It
is a very complicated problem. I am not all that happy that there is
not much trouble in Delhi. There may be stray murders here and there,
but it is not a regular feature as it used to be. This is good. The
Government can be happy about it, but I cannot. This is because I
have not come here to rule. I have stayed on here by sheer
coincidence. I stayed here in the hope that I would bring together
both the sides which are riven with hatred and would be helpful in
doing that. These communities used to quarrel in the past too. But
they used come together once the quarrel was over. But today our
hearts are poisoned, as if we had been enemies for several centuries.
This is unthinkable. We should not be cowards, neither the Muslims
nor the Sikhs, nor the Hindus. Then we would be frightened of 
nobody. The Muslims should cease to be frightened of the Sikhs and
stop running away in fear. The Hindus and the Sikhs should give up
fear of the Muslims. The Hindus, the Sikhs and the Muslims should no
longer fear one another, if we wish to become a great military power.
And, if we choose, India can develop a great non-violent and
invincible army. We have two alternatives before us and there is no
third way out. The way we are following is no way at all. It is the
way of barbarism. There is no way in it to march forward. Thus, I
wish to point out the way that can bring us close to one another. The
most important thing is that the Hindus, the Muslims and the Sikhs
should stop blaming one another as they are doing now. Let them all
see their own mistakes and see them magnified like a mountain. The
Muslims should not say that even though they committed mistakes at
one time, the mistakes the Hindus and the Sikhs are committing today
are so great that their earlier mistakes count for nothing. Nor
should the Hindus retort by saying that even though they have
committed mistakes, their mistakes are nothing compared to what the
Muslims have done. What is so very great in answering mistakes with
mistakes? If we Hindus and Sikhs try to satisfy ourselves by saying
that that has always happened in the world, I would say that it is
not the correct way. That way we can never sit together with a clean
conscience. Today things have reached such a stage that the Pakistan
Government</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
refuses to take in such a large number of Muslims. And then we begin
to wonder if this is due to treachery on their part. What treachery
could there be? But how does it affect us if it is there and they
have some hidden motive? If we do not have enough courage not to be
driven by suspicion, we are going to perish. But let me not talk
about it. I wish to say only this much to the Muslims, the Hindus and
the Sikhs, that they should not even hint at the faults of others.
They should only acknowledge their own faults. If we know that we
have committed a mistake, we must admit it. I had said yesterday that
it is a vicious thing that the Muslims should regard the Hindus as
their enemies. If we become such enemies, the result can be only
unfortunate. What if Pakistan has come into being? Let us not give
way to frenzy. We were enemies till yesterday. Let us be friends from
now on. When we become friends, let us say that we were enemies at
one time but now we are friends and we have forgotten our animosity.
The Government should frankly tell the Hindus, Sikhs and all others
staying in the country that it has made some mistakes and they must
also realize the mistakes they might have made. But why should we
make any mistakes? We will not do so. If we mutually resolve that we
shall have healthy competition and instead of giving two blows for
one shall remain calm even in the face of provocation and resolve to
remain free from guilt, compete in being good, then let me tell you
that all is well with us. And then I can leave Delhi with an easy
mind. If I have got to stay on and even die in Delhi, I shall do so.
I know how to do it. I have learnt nothing else. We have to die one
day in any case. If we cannot do anything, let us at least die. But
let us not kill. I am exhorting everyone to learn at least that much.
Let us do or die. There is no third alternative. Let us not run away
now. We cannot change our fate. We have animosity against none.
Nursing animosity is no way of establishing peace in India. Only when
we do not quarrel with anyone and abandon all fear can India pave the
way to peace. If the Muslims want to live here let them live. Are
they going to kill us? How will they kill us and why? Should they all
go away from here? Why should they go away and where should they go?
Today the people of Pakistan say that they are [not] in a position to
absorb so many Muslims. But the Muslims are spread all over India.
Pakistan is a small country. How can they all be crowded there? If
Pakistan says no more Muslims can be taken in, we shall have to
listen. Why should we imagine there is some duplicity involved? In
any case, how does it affect us? But let us realize that we have our
own fellowmen living</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
with us. If the Muslims are traitors let them be taken to task and
treated according to law. Shoot or do whatever else you want if you
find someone being a traitor and not being loyal to India. Shoot
five, fifty or four crores; I am not bothered. I can at least
understand that. But when one man comes and kills another just for
nothing, how can we tolerate it? We should not tolerate it. And why
should we, on our part, lose our heads? Why should we become such
cowards? That is why I have said that if both the Governments have to
function peacefully, let us compete with one another in being good.
We are not going to win merely by saying that their mistakes are
bigger. But we must realize that if we have made mistakes, we must
remedy them. When we clear up everything, things will be well. I can
talk much more, but it will be enough if you absorb what I have said
today.</p>

the Punjab and the Frontier Province but from every place such
instances have been reported. The newspapers should give proper
publicity to these things. Let them give up publishing the news about
the Hindus and the Muslims killing each other. That does nothing but
harm. The Press has become very powerful in the present world. It can
render great service if it so chooses.</p>

One-fourth of the entire Muslim population is concentrated in the U.
P. They speak Urdu. If we want them to stay there the Devanagari
script should not be forced on them. Malaviyaji too had worked much
in the interest of Hindi. But I never heard him say that the Urdu
language should be wiped out. Those who are in power in the U. P.
today are big people and they are good workers. They keep the Muslims
with them. But if on the one hand we say that  the Muslims should not
go from here, and on the other hand go on insulting them and try to
keep them as slaves, then on their own they will be compelled to go
away from here. Should our being in majority make us so arrogant that
we would not tolerate the presence of others? We should never be like
that. Everybody should learn both the Hindi and the Urdu scripts. If
the Muslims want to go away to Pakistan of their own free will, they
should be allowed to do so. But we must do our duty. After all,
Muslims have left their stamp all over the U. P., and there are grand
Muslim monuments in Agra, Lucknow, Deoband, Azamgarh and other
cities. There are many nationalist Muslims in those places. Besides,
there are many Hindus who know only Urdu. Tej Bahadur Sapru is a
great Urdu scholar. Should he be compelled to write in the Devanagari
script? Should he be asked to forget Urdu? Are we going to cut off
our own hands? If we were to do any such thing, our excesses would
reach the limit. I have no doubt that we will not be able to protect
Hinduism in this way. We should not follow the example of Pakistan.
Hence I call upon the U. P. Government in a spirit of love, even
though I have no control over it, to withdraw its circular<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

	Mysore. Mysore has joined the Indian Union. The people of that State
	are well educated. They have resorted to satyagraha quite often.
	This time too the people offered satyagraha. They wanted adequate
	share for the people in the administration. The Prince would remain
	and the people would be loyal to him; but he should withdraw from
	administration. This should have actually happened, but it did not.
	Hence the satyagraha. The people sent me a  telegram  before
	launching the satyagraha. They informed me that there was no cause
	for me to worry. They said they had decided to resort to satyagraha
	after a great deal of thought and they would strictly conform to the
	rules of satyagraha. They were ready to face any hardships in the
	pursuit of their goal. But the Dewan, Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar, is a
	very great man. He has travelled all over the world. He realized
	that</p>

the people could no longer be ill-treated. How long could it go on?
The result was that all those who had been taken prisoners were
released and the issue was settled between the Mysore State and the
people. All the legitimate demands of the people were accepted by the
State. The ruler, the Dewan and the people should be congratulated on
this settlement. The State has agreed to rule with the consent of the
people. There are many other such Princes. Let them also follow this
example and, like the King of England, rule with the consent of the

Another thing which I want to say is that the place where I stay
belongs to the Birla brothers. They allow everyone to come in. We
must appreciate their good gesture. Usually lakhs of people attend
the prayer meetings. But here the prayer meetings have been small.
Actually I did not expect even the present number. Those attending
these prayer meetings also include people who have come from the
Punjab. I was very pained to learn that some people picked fruits
from the trees around. Nobody should touch a single fruit on the
trees. Why talk of fruit, not even a leaf should be plucked. The
gardener would not at all like people picking fruits like that. There
is a time even for picking fruits. They should not be plucked before
their time. People who come here come to worship. Let our hearts be
pure at least during the prayer meeting. During that period we should
think of nothing but God. How then can we resort to stealing? It may
be that we are all passing through troubled times. But let us not
give up our good behaviour.</p>

I have received another complaint too. People keep coming to see me
throughout the day. Some of them say that by praising Government
officers, the police and the military I have given them a certificate
of efficiency. I have not said any such thing. Even if I did,  it was
a folly on my part or I must have been off my guard. But I have not
said it at all. What I said was that they should all rise to the
occasion. Not that they have already reached that level. It is one
thing to say that a person should have such and such qualities and
another thing for him to have those qualities. In any case, since I
do not know anyone of them, how could I give them any certificate?
How do I know that they are all working according to the law? Our
duty is to abide by the instructions of the police and the military,
because they are given a certain authority.</p>

If we wish to have Panchayat Raj the first rule is that we should
follow its orders. We have not yet achieved the full benefits of
Panchayat Raj. Had we been truly non-violent, this would not have
been so. Even so, the British rule has ended. The Governor-General,
though he is a high-ranking officer in the Navy and belongs to the
royal family, has remained here as our servant. He has to go by the
opinion of our cabinet of Ministers. He is not our master. Rather, we
are his masters. Thus ours is a democratic government and we must all
abide by the laws made by it. If anyone has any complaint against
Government officers the remedy lies in approaching Government or
getting the complaint published in the newspapers. If any officer has
taken to bribery or is inefficient, action should be taken against
him. Those who indulge in graft are committing a crime against
themselves and against the country. Recently some military officers
were found flogging people at the railway station. No officer has a
right to flog anyone. But in retaliation if we also start whipping we
fall victims to the same evil. Before independence, Government
officers used to behave like our masters and not servants. They were
loyal to the British Government, and if they took bribes in those
days, they were committing a crime against the British Government.
But if the officers take bribes now, they are committing a crime
against India. There is such a lot of difference in this.</p>

Some people from Noakhali have also come to me. East Pakistan is no
small country after all. Places like Dacca and Tripura are in East
Pakistan. Those people tell me that the Hindus in Dacca are fleeing.
They fear some atrocities there. Those Bengali friends have requested
me to say something. I can say only what I have been saying all
along. Nobody should leave his country or his home like that. The
brave have nothing to fear. If at all, they are afraid only of God.
They should not run away in cowardice. They must have the courage to
die. They must tell the Pakistan Government that they wish to remain
loyal to Pakistan and stay on there. They must assure it that they
will not betray and cut at the roots of Pakistan. They must say that
the Government may kill them, but cannot abduct their daughters. If
the Government forbids the name of Rama they must insist on uttering
that name. If it says they should not beat drums on the Dussehra Day,
they must insist on doing so and explain that that is part of their
religion. But it is very wrong that influential people run away from

stay on there. There is a large population of Shudras there. How can

my dharma. If the lawyers, doctors, tradesmen, etc., find that they
have got to leave their places, they should see that the poor have
found their safety first. It is not human to run away leaving the
poor behind. That can never bring glory to Hinduism, Islam or
Sikhism. Wherever you go, you should always keep the poor with you.

Those Bengali friends told me that I should request Dr. Ambedkar to
do something in the matter. He has done considerable work among the

should be here in a day or two. But Khwaja Nazimuddin is already
there. He too says that no Hindu or Sikh will be killed in Pakistan.
Suhrawardy Saheb too will go there to help him. How can he avoid

Muslims and Sikhs should live in amity. If this does not happen, both

Of course, behind the opinion lies a train of reasoning. Loyalty
cannot be evoked to order. If circumstances do not warrant it, it may
be said to be impossible to achieve. There is a large number of
people who do not believe in the possibility of such genuine loyalty
and hence laugh at my opinion. Surely there is nothing to laugh at in
conceiving such a possibility. The Muslims of the Union will fight
those of Pakistan when they regard it as a duty, in other words, when
it is clear to them that they are being fairly treated in the Union
and that the non-Muslims are not so treated in Pakistan. Such a state
is not beyond the range of possibility.</p>

Similarly if the non-Muslims of Pakistan clearly feel that they are
being fairly treated there and that they can reside there in safety

minorities of Pakistan will naturally fight the majority in the

It was our misfortune that the country was divided into two parts.
The division was avowedly by reason of religious cleavage. Behind it

It has been repeatedly asked whether in the event of a war between
the two, the Muslims of the Union will fight against the Muslims of
Pakistan and the Hindus of one against those of the other. However
unlikely it may appear at present, there is nothing inherently
impossible in the conception. There is any day  more  risk  in
distrusting the profession of loyalty than in trusting it and
courageously facing the danger of trusting. The question can be more
convincingly put in this way: Will the Hindus ever fight the Hindus

	People write to me and also enquire personally, why my cough is not
	still cured. Whenever I speak a little after the prayer I start
	coughing. I am not taking any treatment either from a doctor or a
	vaid. Doctors tell me that I have allowed it to continue for three
	weeks while the cough can be cured within three days by taking
	penicillin. But according to me Ramanama is the greatest medicine.
	It  is infallible. Like the arrow of Rama which never failed to hit
	the target, this medicine too never fails. But one must be patient.
	I can think of no other alternative in the present circumstances and
	in the context of what is happening in Delhi and all over the
	country there is no other help except God. Whatever I try to do as a
	human being results in failure. There was a time when my words
	carried much weight. Today they have no impact. Have I done anything
	wrong? Or is it that I no longer talk from my heart as I did in
	former days? But I do speak from my heart and you also listen. But
	times have changed. Every age has its own feature. It should be so
	and it is so. But it will not have any effect on me. I do not let
	that happen. I am what I have always been. I know that I have been
	saying now what I have said all along. I have the same faith in
	non-violence and truth as I had before. Maybe, my faith is much
	deeper now. The times have changed but I have not. Prayer has an
	effect on those who listen to it in good faith. Man can act only
	according to his own nature. There is no room for hypocrisy in this.</p>

	What I am doing today is in the name of God. I trust Him. Why should
	I give up Ramanama just for the sake of this minor illness? Either
	this illness has to go or I have to be overcome by it. What is so
	very great if man dies? Everyone is ordained to die from the time of
	his birth. If God wants something done through me He will keep me
	alive, otherwise He will kill me by this cough. The <i>bhajan </i>which
	the girl sang a moment ago says that one should repeat Ramanama. One
	should forget desire, anger, attachment, infatuation, but never
	forget Ramanama because He is one’s sole refuge. It is for one to
	sing the <i>bhajan </i>and meditate on it. But when I start coughing

As usual some blankets have been received today also. Some cheques
too have been received. With great enthusiasm a Muslim gentleman came
and left a quilt containing two and a half seers of cotton. He wants
it to be given to someone who had nothing to cover himself with.
Arrangements are being made to do that. It is being remarked that
things are not being given to the people with as much enthusiasm as
would be expected. As for myself I want to express my gratitude to
the people that they are sending blankets and money so promptly. Some
people send money because they cannot buy blankets at cheaper rates.

Rajendra Babu had called a committee to discuss the food problem. The
committee did not discuss anything about the problem of cloth. With
regard to food and cloth I continue to hold the same views that I
have held the past few months. I agree that the poor are put to
greater hardship and they would be worse off. Some people write to me
and those who are working among the peasants came and told me that
the peasants were happy about what I have said. They feel that it
would help them to get rid of the controls imposed on them. They
would have at least some oportunities. Their granaries are full. Are
they going to consume the entire stock of grains? Even if they want
to earn money, would they resort to black-marketing? Peasants are
simple-hearted people. Why should they resort to black- marketing?
They are happy if they get a small margin of profit. What have they
got to do with scheming or black-marketing? And so, let me tell you,
and through you the Government, that we should have at least that
much faith in the people. Why do we not have the courage to scrap
rationing? We need not fear any untoward consequences. Why have you
assumed that people have become wicked and are hiding their food
stocks? After all, you yourselves are the Government. You can again
revert to controls if you find that the situation has worsened. There
is no justification for making people after if you do not have that
much courage. Things should be done according to the practice of
Panchayat Raj.</p>

Mill-owners say they have piles of cloth stocked with them. But how
can they release it when there is control on it? I do believe that
they are not talking about their own profits. They are talking purely
in the interests of the people. If they are given freedom they can
bring out their stocks and cloth can reach the people. How terrible
it is that there is enough stock of grains in the country but it does
not reach the people it should. It seems to me that there is
something basically wrong about it. Our bureaucrats wish to work
sitting at their desks. They have in front of them their tables and
red tape and wax. All that they have to do is to put red tape and
make the file. Have they ever lived among the peasants? Have they
ever acquainted themselves with the peasants? Very respectfully, I
wish to tell them that they should not take it for granted that
people will die. With open eyes we see that people are dying because
of controls. Those who are given to evil things and acts of madness
continue to indulge in their activities, but their strong points are
not seen. I would say that both these controls should be removed as
early as possible. Even if there are some hidden stocks, people will
become vigilant. The soaring prices of cloth, food- stuffs and other
things will come down. Now there is no war and nothing is going out
of the country. But the prices are still going up. I feel it is most
disgraceful and our heads should hang in shame. The Government should
trust the people and have courage. It should act boldly and remove
controls as early as possible. This is my firm belief which is
increasing day by day.</p>

Today we are all agitated. All through the day we fear death at the
hands of the Muslims or the Hindus or the Sikhs. We are obsessed by
that fear and can think of nothing better. There is animosity between
these communities, but we cannot get over it by brooding over it. Our
scriptures also say that man becomes what he thinks. The poison
spreads in our system. It affects our thought and then the Hindus
want to kill the Muslims and the Muslims want to kill the Hindus and
the Sikhs. If we continue to think along these lines, it would become
our second nature. Are we going to be reduced to this state after

satyagraha. When the Punjab was under Martial Law, a reign of terror
was let loose. Hundreds of thousands of men had to crawl on their
bellies. They crawled on their bellies because they loved their
lives. I have forgotten the name of that narrow lane in Amritsar.
They crawled on their bellies simply in order to remain alive. They
were threatened with death if they refused to crawl. But why should
any- one do such a thing merely in order to live? They could have
stood up and refused to crawl, saying, “Never to accept defeat even

say that we shall not be defeated even if we have to die and lose all

falsehood. What does it matter if there are only a handful of people
in South Africa? How can there be millions to offer satyagraha? In
any case, the population there is only a few lakhs. Even if a few
hundred, even if only ten persons come forward, they will add to the
prestige of India. They ask me why I do not also request the people
here to send money. That pains me. They are not poor people. They
have gone to South Africa to make money. They have not gone there to
oblige us. Those who are carrying on the struggle there do not have
much money, and the moneyed people do not give them anything. Those
who own money begin to love only money. They see their honour and
respect only in money. Our people in South Africa say they are

Of all the numerous letters and telegrams received for the Charkha
Jayanti, a letter in Hindustani received from the Indore Adult
Education Association most arrested my attention. The purport of it
is that the Association in question instead of wasting time in
performing some flattering function, devoted the <i>Jayanti </i>week
to doing urgent and useful work, i.e., young and old, rich and poor,
official, and non- official, banded together in destroying a noxious
weed harmful to man and beast. If such co-operation became the
abiding feature of any locality, it would constitute the best
education for young and old and change the face of the society in
which it was done.</p>

I understand your letter. Your pain is from ignorance. I also
referred<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>to
[your letter] in yesterday’s prayer speech without giving your
name. My cough is almost cured. It is not troubling me any more but I
do cough a little when I speak. It is almost like “Those who are in
it enjoy rare happiness, the spectators are scorched.” It is not
that I have been careless about it, though I am more and more
inclined towards relying on Rama. One who relies on Rama can never be
careless. He becomes more and more indifferent as to outer treatment
and in doing so it can be tested whether or not Ramanama has reached
his inner being. Don’t worry about me at all. If God grants me
strength and reason I wish to do or die here.</p>

	invaders, settled in this country. They started to think how they
	could settle down in this country. As a matter of fact, Urdu was
	born out of this fusion and it acquired a distinct form as in course
	of time they crammed Arabic and Persian words into the language.
	They even put a new garb on it. Its grammar also comes from those
	languages. That is not the case with Hindustani whose grammar
	belongs to this soil. Whatever Persian words there are in Urdu have
	been there for ages. It is not for us to pick out those words and
	remove them from the language. The people who came as invaders
	settled down here and adopted local customs. I think if we hate them

as hating ourselves. But today I am mentioning this for another 
reason. I have written sufficiently about it. As far as the English
language is concerned it was different. The British came here to
build an empire. They had no intention of settling here. They never
came to belong to India. They always considered themselves outsiders
here, and wanted to remain as such. They wanted their children to  be
brought up outside India. Later they also introduced the English
language. Slowly they gave it a particular shape. Nothing happened to
English similar to what happened in the case of Urdu. Urdu came into
being from avadhi or other languages spoken at that time. But that is
not the case with English. Now the British rule has ended in India.
But what will be our fate if the English language continues to
dominate us and we cannot carry on our administration without that
language? Will the millions of India then learn English? Will English
become our national language? Let me tell you very plainly that that
is not possible. Let us not even try to do any such thing. We are
sure to ruin ourselves if we ever try to do so.</p>

A gentleman writes to me to say that I am mistaken. He says that all
those who carry on the work in the country have studied English. But
only a handful of people have studied English. It is true that they
carried on their work in English in courts and offices, because they
could thus exercise their authority. Those who have lived in slavery
get used to liking the language of the State. That is all right. But
when the poor Hindustani or Hindi-speaking people go  to  courts  and
offices where the work is carried on in English, they understand
nothing at all. This is only betraying our intellectual bankruptcy.
We just do not want to understand anything. We do not even want to
know where our interests lie. The British rule has gone. Now the
English language too will have to come down from the pedestal on
which we have installed it and where it should never have been. A
gentleman writes to me that quite another interpretation will be
given to what I am saying. For people never see the intended meaning
in things.</p>

time at the Ashram in South Africa. It is not that only Pandit Khare
has prepared such a collection. Many others have also done so. For
those were the days of our non-violent struggle for freedom. After
some years many people felt frustrated that we had not yet won
freedom. It could only be concluded that there was something wrong
with us. Good people should never think that when something goes
wrong the reason is to be sought elsewhere. It is not right to think
that the blame lies with our neighbours or our brothers but not with
us. That is no the right way but the wrong one. It is incorrect to
think that when things go wrong the fault lies with others and never
with us. All devotees of God have said this. Tulsidas has said the
same thing. So also Surdas who sings: “Who can be so crooked,
wicked, or dissolute as I?”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Neither
Tulsidas nor Surdas was such a person; but they regarded themselves
as such. The more they remained away from God, the more unhappy they
felt, even if they were surrounded by brothers, sisters, sons,
friends and everybody else. They reflect with a sigh that there is
none as crooked, wicked or dissolute as themselves. It is good that
they searched within themselves for faults. This <i>bhajan </i>also
expresses the same sentiment. Here the poet asks why he is alive
though he has no seen God so far. As a rule  it was Pandit Khare who
used to sing this <i>bhajan; </i>but sometimes when he was not
present or was ill, Maganlal used to sing it. Maganlal was no
musician but he had a good voice. That <i>bhajan </i>as he sang it,
still rings in my ears. He was the pillar of the Ashram. He was like
a rock in the management of the Ashram. He was very sturdy. He would
be always ahead of everyone else in digging with the pickaxe. He used
to have a very strong body when he was in South Africa. But when he
came here he lost weight, though he was not ill. Though he had to
shoulder the entire responsibility there, here the unusual thing was
that</p>

he had to work among crores of people. He shared considerable
responsibility of the constructive programme. How can we dispense
with the constructive programme? What can swaraj mean without the
constructive programme? We have attained independence, but what is
its worth? What if we have achieved independence? Today we realize
that if we had done sufficient constructive work in those days we
would not be witnessing the scenes we see today. Is this the swaraj
we had in mind? If we had done that much in those days, India’s
history would have been different. I have no doubt about it at all.
Maganlal’s God was in swaraj. His swaraj was <i>Ramarajya</i>.</p>

God can be seen only in swaraj. After all, God does not possess any
physical form. Some say He is a four-armed figure bearing in His
hands the conch, the disk, the mace and the lotus. This is all our
own imagination. How can God bear the conch, the disk, the mace and
the lotus? He is  <i>niranjan</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
 <i>niraka</i>r<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>.  When  He  is  beyond  physical existence how can He
have a physical form? We create an image of God and then believe in
it. Where, then, should we look for our God? Let us see Him in our
actions. When we do anything considering it as <i>yajna, </i>we
install God in our hearts. For instance, when a person plies the
charkha, ne sees God in the yarn he spins. When he realizes that the
whole world belongs to him and his world consists of India where the
poor, who do not get enough to eat, live, and that he is spinning for
their sake or for <i>Daridranarayana</i>, he sees God in the yarn he
spins. Swaraj was far off in those days. But when the Ashram was not
functioning well, many a time Maganlal used to sing with a sigh:
“Still does cruel life cling obstinately to the body”. Then the
<i>bhajan </i>goes on to say that the four <i>prahara </i>passed like
four <i>yugas. </i>It means that even though the whole night has
passed, life has not yet gone from me. The four quarters of the night
have passed like four ages. That is, the night of four quarters
passed but my body did not perish. He finds four quarters as long as
four ages. I also find them as long. We had not won our freedom then.
Now I admit that we have won it on August 15. But I do not regard it
as true swaraj. It is not the swaraj of my conception. Nor can this
swaraj be called <i>Ramarajya. </i>Today we have come to regard each
other as enemies. Muslims are enemies of the Hindus and the Hindus
and the Sikhs are enemies of the Muslims. But swaraj of my conception
means that we do not want to regard</p>

anyone as our enemy, nor do we want to be enemies of anyone. That
swaraj has not yet come. Should the Hindus and the Muslims in India
consider themselves enemies of each other? Will our brothers live in
mutual animosity? Why do I say this? I had mentioned this briefly
once, but I wish to say it again and agan that if we truly desire to
rise higher, we should all live like brothers. We have fallen at the
moment and are probably still going down. Our hearts are full of
murderous thoughts and hatred. We get incensed at the very sight of a
Muslim. If we find him praying in the mosque we go and kill him. We
regard him as our enemy and wonder how we should drive him out and
turn his mosque into a temple. But think, what wrong has he done in
praying in a mosque? The temple and the mosque are one and the same.
Then why is it that the Muslims should destroy the temples and the
Hindus destroy the mosques? They are equally at fault in the eyes of
God. How can we say there is swaraj when what we Hindus do hurts the
Muslims and what the Muslims do hurts the Hindus? We have reduced
ourselves to this state, but we wish to come out of this fire.</p>

I have already said that I shall either do or die in Delhi. I have
come here with that intention. I have not done anything yet. True,
these days we do not hear much about communal, clashes, and
apparently we are living like brothers. But this is like deceving
ourselves. The police and the military are posted here just because
there is some danger. Are the Muslims who are here free from fear?
Will I also be free from it? I don’t think so. Some Muslims are
here with me too. Would you insult them right here? Would you kill
them right before my eyes? Before you kill them you will have to kill
me. Sheikh Abdullah was sitting behind me here yesterday. There were
also some Kashmiri Pandits with him. The Sheikh is our friend.
Somebody killed our Rafi Saheb’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

tale here lest it should  arouse repugnance in the people. My heart
is full of many things. I know quite a few things. But I do not wish
to prolong the talk. However let me give you the gist at least. If
all of us long for death because we have not been able to see God, as
we sing in the <i>bhajan, </i>the first step towards it is to see our
faults as big as mountains and overlook the faults of others. If we
declare before the whole world that the entire fault lies with us,
and others are all good men, it is not cowardice. We</p>

If we wish to bring about the rule of God or <i>Ramarajya </i>in
India,  I would suggest that our first task is to magnify our own
faults and find no fault with the Muslims. I do not say that the
Muslims have done no wrong. They have caused a lot of harm. There is
no question of covering up those wrongs or pretending ignorance about
them. But knowingly I do not see them. If I start thinking about
those wrongs, I shall go crazy and I shall not be able to serve
India. What if I begin to think that I have no enemies and expose my
own faults before the world and close my eyes to those of others? God
is there to see them. What does it matter if someone slaps me or cuts
my ears or throat? One has to die some time. There is God to do
justice. In whatever I do, I should not forget Him. That is why I
want to repeat again and again that you must keep your hearts so pure
that none in the world may complain to me against you. Today when I
went there<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I was asked about the situation in Delhi. I had to hang
my head in shame. For, even now, the Hindus and the Muslim are not
one at heart. It is good that because of the police and the military
arranged by the Sardar and Jawaharlal, they are not cutting each
other’s throats. But what of that? Even the British used to make
such arrangements. We do not wish to see what is happening in Delhi.
Today my wings are clipped. If I could grow my wings again, I would
fly to Pakistan and see even there what crimes the Hindus or the
Sikhs have committed. But what even if they have done anything? Why
should they not stay in their own homes there? But do I have the face
to say that today? I can only reason with people and tell everyone
that if we wish to see God and establish true swaraj, we must all
unite and declare that India is not a fallen country. The result will
be that our prestige will rise and we will also have time to banish
hunger and thirst from our country.</p>

	One letter I have already sent through Prabhavati, two days ago.
	This is the second. You must have received the wire I sent you about
	Chand. She is so much in your thoughts you must go to her. As for
	myself I am not worried. I saw Dr. Manu’s report today. That also
	does not indicate anything serious. Sushila will certainly reach
	there. I have sent a letter. Still you must do whatever your hearts

I told you only last evening that all was not well with Delhi as it
appeared on the surface. So long as tragedies such as I described

Of course, it may be only a scare and there may be nothing beyond it.
There may be no secret circular. There is, however, prudence in not
disregarding such warnings. I am hoping that the writer’s fears are
wholly groundless. I agree with him that all promise of protection by
authority in isolated places is vain. It simply cannot be done, no
matter how efficient the military and police machine may be which, it
must be admitted, it is not at present. Protection must come first
from within, that is, from rocklike faith in God  and secondly, from
the goodwill of the neighbouring population. If neither in present,
the best and the safest way is to leave India’s inhospitable
shores. Things have not come to such a pass.</p>

The duty of all us is to regard with special attention all the
Britishers who choose to remain in India as its faithful servants.
They must be free from any kind of insult or disregard. The Press and

respects, if we are to render a good account of ourselves as a free

good the claim, if they will not respect their neighbours, however
few or insignificant they may be.</p>

	The law of ahimsa is that one does not hit back at the assailant,
	faces the attack in a spirit of love and dies in the process. When
	one dies facing the assailant’s attack in a spirit of love, a
	change of heart takes place in him. It is not always easy to say if
	the love was true or when the change of heart on the part of the
	assailant comes about. But while practising ahimsa, it is enough to
	keep in mind the  law  of ahimsa and the way it works.</p>

	How can I ask anyone not to leave the land of his birth? The leaders
	were able to come so easily with their families and belongings but
	the poor, helpless villagers are in a sad plight. If even one of you
	had died there I would have danced for joy. I would not have been
	distressed in the least. That the teachers of a national institution

	fez caps rather than die, what does it show? Jinnah says he has pro-
	vided protection for all and still people flee. But if a few of you
	had continued to wear khadi caps and Hindu dress as you used to and
	carried on your normal vocations and if then you had been killed, I
	could have asked Jinnah what had happened to his promise. But how

In all that I am telling you I attach no blame to you. It is I who am
to be blamed. There has been some flaw somewhere in my ahimsa. And
this was bound to have its effect on the people. How otherwise could
they suddenly have lost the power of self-sacrifice? I must analyse
this. I must undergo further penance. If even people like you are
coming away, how can I tell the refugees not to leave their homes but
to die there, or that they must go back to their homes?</p>

	from now such are the thoughts that have come to possess us. We want
	to kill simply because we possess a revolver. It is like a person
	aiming at a flying bird and killing it. Great hunter that he is, he
	aims at a flying bird. Similarly a man makes an officer his aim.
	That officer had received orders to carry out a certain task at the
	place. But the killer had a fancy to kill him. If we continue like
	this, we are going to land ourselves in a terrible situation. No man
	can then live in peace. It is said that there are many countries
	inhabited by savages where no one can live in safety because those
	who posses arms murder people and they have no qualms about it. The
	one who kills a person cannot bring him back to life. This is a
	fact. It is also a law that only he who gives life can take it away.
	But that is what only God can do. When a human being cannot create
	life, what right has he to take it? Is it up to man to create life?
	But the Hindus desire to pounce upon the Muslims and the Muslims
	want to pounce upon the Sikhs and the Sikhs want to jump at the
	Muslims. They may do this now, but when the enemies are</p>

Another thing is that the authorities have arrested many people. In
the past we were not free. Today also we should presume that we are
not free. In those days also people were arrested. At the most they
could make an appeal to the Viceroy and could be released at his
word. But the Viceroy could not release them on his own. He had to
work within the limits of the law even when martial law was in force.
He had his own officers functioning under the law. If they agreed
that somebody might be released he was released. As for the others
the Viceroy would say he could get them released only after
investigation. This is a perfectly legal position. Those arrested
under the law,would be sentenced if found guilty. But now the
Governments is in our hands. We had not run the Government so far. If
someone minister thinks that just because he is a minister he can
release whomever he wants to, then we will be finished. It should not
be that murderers are arrested and later released. We should not
follow the practice of arresting culprits and then releasing them. In
such a situation I would say that once somebody has been arrested
under the law by the police the Government cannot release him because
there is some complaint or appeal for it. On what grounds can it
release him? Is it for nothing that we have the police, courts and
prosecutors? How can I acquit somebody because he happens to be some
relative or a friend of mine or because his case has been recommended
by somebody? How can he be acquitted? In my view he cannot be
acquitted. He cannot be punished at all if he is not guilty. Thus, we
must keep our entire judiciary clean. We must have judges of that
calibre. The police and the prosecutors should not carry on a case
just for doing so and they should not think that a particular number
of cases should be settled by the court. Only those who have got to
be punished should be punished. But legally these matters fall within
the jurisdiction of the courts. Supposing a man complains that a
particular person has assaulted him and should be arrested, and the
offender is arrested, should I then go to a minister to secure his
release? The minister would suggest that the matter be taken to the
court. If the complainant then says that there is no point in
arresting him as it would only aggravate the feeling of animosity,
the offender would be acquitted on the complainant’s request. If
the complainant says that even though he had filed a complaint he
wishes that the arrested man should be</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
acquitted, then the court can acquit him. That leaves the prosecutor.
The court can recommend the same thing to him too. But if there is a
case of murder actually committed, the accused cannot be acquitted
even if the complainant wants it. If the guilty man is acquited, our
work cannot proceed. I have practised law and secured the release of
many. How? The murderer must plead guilty of the murder and then
assure the court that his mind is now pure and plead for mercy. The
complainant can also say that the accused should not be punished
because the two have become friends. What will he gain by getting him
hanged now when he killed under provocation? Now the accused has
become a friend who can be of help and who may turn his mind to God.
He may start praying to God and, if so, why should he prevent him
from doing so? Then the accused will also plead guilty of the act of
number and pray for mercy and seek to be acquitted saying that the
complainant is prepared to forgive him and maybe he will do good
deeds and serve the society. That is the way to secure  the acquittal
of the murderer. It is possible to make his procedure legal. But let
us not misuse the power we have now. If we do so people will insist
on any number of guilty persons being released. What would even the
poor minister do? Supposing he wrongly orders somebody’s release.
It is within his power to order the release of a person, but he
should not do so. Even if it is his own brother or friend or wife who
has committed a crime, he should refrain from doing so. He should say
the appeal sould be made to the court or the prosecutor or the
complainant, for the cannot do anything in the matter. We cannot get
on with our work unless the ministers are pure at heart.</p>

Please know that I have received a suggestion that I should not speak
for more than 15 minutes. I do not even wish to speak longer. I have
talked enough. I am not particularly fond of speaking at length.  I
speak only when there is a need to talk. But I am told that it would
be to the greater benefit of people if I did not speak for more than
15 minutes. People would listen with greater attention because they
would be keen to listen to my words. That would also become a habit

Time goes on doing its work. Occasionally it favours us. Sometimes it
becomes our enemy. Today that seems to be so. Hindu- Muslim unity has
been my lifelong ambition. Muslims always considered me as their true
friend and guide. Was it not at the bidding of a Muslim that I went
to South Africa? How is it then that today I am an enemy of Muslims?
You know that today because of you I have become an eyesore to
everyone. Hindus are very much annoyed with me. You should be
knowing, if you do not, how furious Hindus are with me. I shall not
be surprised if one day I fall a prey to this fury. It is so not only
in my case, but also in the case of these girls. Last time I came to
Delhi, Manu even received a letter threatening her life. Here at the
Bhangi Colony she was being repeatedly threatened on the telephone by
certain Hindus. But she has come prepared for death and so is not
frightened. I know that there is a third party that does not let this
unity be achieved. You have seen with your own eyes the futility of
violence. If this terrible and meaningless slaughter continues I
really cannot foresee what mankind has in store for it. But even in
the face of this reality I remain an optimist. I will therefore carry
on with my mission till my last breath.</p>

A gentlemen approached me. I hardly ever read any Urdu newspaper, not
to speak of reading it daily. I do read Urdu but only with some
difficulty. When a child has to learn his alphabet he starts reading
gradually. I am in a similar position. I know a little more than  a
child, but I cannot read fast. So that gentleman read out to me a
couple of items from an Urdu newspaper. I was pained to hear the
contents. I do not intend to narrate the details. The newspaper
stated that people had made up their minds. I hope it is only the
editor of that paper and not the whole country that has  resolved 
that  all Muslims should migrate to Pakistan and that those who
remain will be either slaughtered or sent away to Pakistan. If things
turn out to be what this paper or its editor predicts, it will be a
matter of great shame. Such things should not have come from the pen
of an editor. Such newspapers should not be published at all. If that
editor is convinced about what he says, he is free to express his
view to the people. But when he does so, it would amount to
proclaiming from the house-tops that the Muslims should either go
away to Pakistan or they will be slaughtered. As I said yesterday,
what Hindus would do when Muslims went away to Pakistan? Would they
fight among themselves? Somebody has informed me that internal fights
have already started. This is inevitable. Once one has a taste of
killing, one can’t resist the temptation. The same thing is going
to happen to us. But the editor of that paper has not been wise in
publishing his opinion. Our people have become crazy after
newspapers. They are not concerned with the <i>Gita </i>or the Bible
or the Koran; the newspaper is their <i>Gita  </i>and whatever is
published in newspapers is gospel truth for them. It is very
unfortunate that people should be so gullible that newspapers exploit
their credulity and publish such things. I do not wish to say any
more about this.</p>

Now another thing is that complaints are pouring in from all corners.
It may have been that during the British days the native States acted
as they liked. The British Government exercised some control. This
had to be done for the maintenance of the Empire. But now that
Government is no more. Today their department is in the hands of
Sardar Patel; so let him do something. But what can poor Sardar do
under the circumstances? He has his own way of saying things. He has
always served India. That is why he is the Sardar. But he has neither</p>

arms nor army in his possesion. He is not a man of the army in any
case. He is no commander whose order would be  automatically obeyed.
So long as the soldiers think that they eat the salt of India and he
is their master, that is, if they consider him to be a great servant
[of the people], things will go right.</p>

Now the Princes of the States say that they have signed the
instruments of accession, but that does not mean that they have been
deprived of anything. They too have got their police. They were mere
puppets during the British rule, but they are no longer so. The
States can do anything they want. I too belong to a State. Hence I
know what the States can do, and how much good they can do. I wish
very respectfully to tell the Princes of the States that they cannot
hope to survive if they think in their arrogance that they can beat
up their subjects and slaughter them. I have told them that the
Princes will have place for themselves if they remain trustees of
their subjects. If they want to be the rulers of their people and
exploit them and oppress them, they will find no place for
themselves. I have no doubt about it. God alone knows what the
situation in India is going to be. The Princes do not have an
alternative. They can never rule India, even if we become slaves.
Woud the Princes like to become slaves then? The days when the rulers
could act arbitrarily are gone. That was another age. The British
rulers found good use of the Princes who were there, through whom
they could rule. The British only acted in their self- interest. How
then are they to blame? But it is our misfortune that today we have
lost our heads and fight among ourselves. Whichever side wins, a
third power or a few of the powers would get together and devour
India. Along with India Princes, too, would be devoured. If they
remain loyal to India and become servants of their people, it will be
well. I would say to the people of the States that they should not be
cowards. What if the Princes possess arms and they are unarmed? We
too fought against the Empire. And we were unarmed then. We did not
possess any arms secretly. Had it been so, I should have had some
information about it. Millions of people fought against the Empire
with the force of their conviction. We thought even if they killed,
they might kill one lakh, two or even three lakhs. But how many could
they have killed after all? It was a question of population of 400
millions. Their hands would have trembled if they had set out to kill
all of us. These 400 millions were bound to win their independence.
What we do with that freedom is another matter. I would say that the
Princes should not lose their heads. They should realize that they
cannot act</p>

I mentioned once that Dussehra was coming soon. And Bakr-Id is just
the day after it. These two festivals almost coincide. The Hindus and
the Muslims are always filled with fear during these days. There is a
greater scare here today because excesses can be only on one side. If
Hindus get excited and think that they have got thier  chance because
of Bakr-Id, they can slaughter the Muslims thinking they were
celebrating Dussehra. What is Dussehra? That is the day for
celebrating Rama’s victory. It is said that on the <i>Ekadashi </i>Rama
and Bharata would be reunited. By these things we have to learn
restraint and goodness. We have to learn what is dharma. If we learn
this we can celebrate Dussehra in the right spirit. Durga <i>puja </i>is
conducted on the Dussehra day. What does worship of Durga imply? It
does not mean that we should be bloodthirsty. Durga signifies <i>shakti,
</i>great power. We can raise ourselves by worshipping here.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.01cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Similarly, Dussehra does not mean that we should have fun and
entertainment throughout the day. In Gujarat this festival is called
<i>Navaratri</i><i>.</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>When we were young my mother used to tell us that we
should not have regular meals during the <i>Navaratri. </i>We could
have fruit or at the most milk, but no solid food. Of course the best
thing would have been to observe complete fast. My mother used to
undertake fasts quite often, and I could hardly compete with her. My
elder brother could not do it at all, though I tried to do it a
little. But considering my mother’s capacity to fast I am a mere
toy, just a child. That is the singnificance of Dussehra for us.
Later, when  Dewali comes, we can eat nice things and enjoy
ourselves, but none of these things during Dussehra. This is the
meaning of <i>Navaratri</i>. Shall we abandon its essence and start
killing? Then there is Bakr-Id. We have frightened away our Muslim
fellowmen. There are nice people among them. Even the nationalist
Muslims are very much upset  at  the moment. They are aware of the
situation. But where can they go? Should we become so heartless as to
drive away even these people? What sort of peace would we have then?</p>

pressurized, would you agree to become Muslims? Supposing you were
forced to read the <i>Kalma </i>and threatened with death if you

courage. It is senseless to ask Muslims to accept Hinduism like this.
I don’t want such Hindus. Am I going to save Hinduism with the help
of such Hindus? I want Hindus who can exercise restraint. Why should
I be so arrogant and ruthless? One cannot become a tyrant and  follow
 dharma at the same time. On these two occasions therefore let us

A Hindu gentleman has asked me if I would go to the Punjab. I asked
him if he would send me to the Punjab. Yes, if I went there I would
fight with the people there also. You already know about my method of
fighting. I would talk to them to my heart’ content. Millions of
Hindus and Sikhs are coming here. Why do they not stay on in their
homes? I shall have no peace till this happens. Then Muslims have to
be brought back here. You may say that that cannot be done. According
to me that can be done and the key to  the  situation lies in Delhi.
I do hope that during those two days we prove that both the Hindus
and the Muslims are good and are going to live together in harmony.</p>

	Two persons have written to me “We are refugees. We are living
	under the protection of our friends. We are very much troubled on
	account of the cold weather. Kindly let us know from where we can
	get blankets and quilts. Is there any such provision for refugees?”
	They say they belong to Rawalpindi. Like that there are innumerable
	people. However, the quilts and blankets are actually being
	collected for the people accommodated in the refugee camps, and who
	as is very evident have nothing to cover themselves with. Hence
	provision is being made for them. Quite a large stock has been
	distributed and more will be distributed. These are not just a
	handful of people. They are there in thousands. Quite likely, there
	are lakhs and lakhs of such people who should get these things. One
	of the camps at Kurukshetra has been taken over by the Central
	Govenment. A large number of people are accommodated there and many
	more keep coming.</p>

	There are many such camps even in the city of Delhi. At least three,
	perhaps four, camps are in East Punjab. In those camps also the
	people should receive the things provided in the camp here. They too
	are refugees. But in my view, it is for the friends with whom the
	refugees stay to arrange for those things. Very likely those friends
	may be managing blankets or quilts for their own families with great
	difficulty. Then, how can they provide them to those whom they have
	given shelter? I don’t say such a thing is not possible. But it
	seems to me we will not be able to give quilts to all who need them.
	Moreover, I do not think that everyone who asks for these things is
	honest about it. It is not as if people asked for these things
	because they needed them.  I have seen several camps. I have always
	been engaged in this type of work. I had to do these things even
	when I was in South Africa, and so I am familiar with the
	difficulties of such work. I have heard no complaints against the
	two persons who have written to me, and I have nothing to say
	against them. But I have no doubt that these things should reach the
	people who are really needy and who do not have them. But how would
	I know about these people? I do try to find out. It is not as if I
	am not trying to get any information at all. Nor do I</p>

presume that no one would ever deceive me. And it is not that anyone
can have things from me for the asking. Can these friends point out
any such instance to me? I cannot send those things myself but I
think these persons will somehow get them from somewhere. I do have
blankets with me. But they are all meant to be sent to Kurukshetra.
Other people are collecting these things too. They can send the
blankets to these two people.</p>

People are still coming here every day. They go to the Birla Mandir
and that place is all full. Now there is no room for any more people.
The people in the temple have taken as many people as they can. They
have always shared the sorrows of others. They are working day and
night. They go to meet people and collect blankets and food from them
which they distribute among the needy. But as people pour in day
after day, they too get tired How long can they go on giving things
to them? The same is the problem for us. I would only tell these
people that they should do something for themselves. It is true that
when these things are done for everybody they should be done for
these persons also. The same rule should apply to all. We cannot
carry on work on a large scale if we have one rule for some people
and another rule for others. And we have to work on a large scale.
That is why I have taken so much time in explaining these things. How
shall we face the cold which is increasing every day? I do not wish
that anyone should suffer from it even for a day. This is one thing I
wish to say.</p>

I heard another thing today. Since many shops were open today a poor
Muslim thought he would also open his shop, and so he started out to
open his shop. He used to repair spectacles. Such persons must be
hardly earning a few rupees a day. I do not know who he was. I do not
even know his name. He was murdered as he was about to open his shop.
It is a matter of shame for the whole of Delhi. Who could have
committed that murder? Was it one person or two who did it? But how
could two persons do it? Where had the military and the police
disappeared? The shop was not in a lonely corner. Nor did the
incident take place at night. No shop can be run secretly. People
keep coming and going. Why did no one try to stop the killing? How
did the assailants dare to commit that murder? People are just
indifferent and quiet their conscience with the thought that a Muslim
has been done to death. They feel that if the Muslims kill the Hindu
and the Sikhs, why should they not kill the Muslims? Their hearts are
possessed by such thoughts of revenge. Thus must be stopped. If we</p>

only the Hindus and the Sikhs will be living in Delhi? In that case

Today I wish to say something about the people who have become
victims of leprosy. There are quite a number of such people even in
India. They are not found on the roads because they arouse a feeling
of respugnance. It is not as if people having leprosy are sinner and
others suffering from other diseases are not. It is true that those
who suffer from a disease must have violated some how of nature, but
that is another matter. I feel I have violated nature’s law because
I am suffering from persistent cough. And I do believe that violating
nature’s law is being sinful. Everybody is prone to cough. But I am
not prepared to agree that there has been no mistake on my part. So
whatever rules I make for myself would be applicable to the whole
world. Leprosy is a skin disease. How it is caused is a long story. I
believe it is disease of the body and there is no difference between
leprosy and cough. A victim of leprosy suffers more pain and when he
starts losing his thumbs, hands and nose, he becomes really very
ugly. But it is not that he suffer more pain because he becomes ugly.
I would say that we should have greater contempt for people who have
wicked hearts. A person who has an unclean body which is the result
of an unclean mind and who has a perverse outlook, instead of
listening to the <i>bhajans </i>is interested in listening to the
stories  of wicked men, is a real leper. There are countless people
suffering from this disease, and nobody ever bother about them. But
since everybody does not contract the disease of leprosy, we are
repelled by those who have it. We used to have a number of Christians
amongst us. All the leprosy hospitals were and still are in the hands
of the Christians. They serve the lepers out of sheer philanthropy.
Today there are some people in India also who work for the lepers out
of a feeling of altruism. One such philanthropist is Manohar Diwan. I
should like to call him a <i>mahatma. </i>He lives at Wardha and is a
great disciple of Vinoba. Bhave. Vinoba is a very great man indeed.
Manohar felt that he also should do something. He chose to serve the
lepers. Vinoba also inspired him to do that work. He remains
detached. He is not bothered about money. He is no doctor, but he has
made sufficient study of the disease. Many people seek his help. A
small conference is being organized at Wardha very soon through a
committee. People</p>

engaged in this work will be meeting there on the 30th of this month.
Dr. Sushila Nayyar too is going there for the same purpose. Actually
Dr. Jivaraj<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and Rajkumari were to go there. Rajkumari is even more
familiar with this work because she has lived with me at Sevagram.
But as she is deeply involved in the work here she cannot go there.
No one can compel her to go there. And who would insist? It is a
matter of rendering service. Anyone who chooses to go can go there.
But they cannot go because they aree hardpressed for time. There is a
man called Jagadisan<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>.
He is himself a victim of leprosy. He belongs to Madras. He is a very
good man and great scholar. He is a great follower of Srinivasa
Sastri. He has devoted himself to this work. He is also attending the
conference along with many other. It is a tragic and at the same time
an interesting story. Many people are involved in that work. There is
a very big leprosy hospital in Calcutta. It functions on  a large
scale. All this work is being done in the spirit of altruism and is
growing day by day. When I was in Calcutta I was taken there and
asked to write some comments. But I was making arrangements to come
here. There are many other leprosy hospitals in different parts of
the country. But this work is not being carried on as large a scale
as it should be. I do not suggest that everybody should take interest
in this work. But let us at least know that when we have so much idle
time we may as well engage ourselves in such type of work. Shall we
remain busy only destroying each other? I woud say that this is the
worst type of disease, the worst type of leprosy. We disregard good
work and destroy ourselves in mutual fighting. The Hindus kill the
Muslims and the Muslims kill the Hindus and the Sikhs. How long shall
we continue to indulge in mutual killing? How much better it would be
if we made good use of our time and devoted ourselves to activities
that would promote feelings of love!</p>

I have been explaining of late that neither in Kathiawar nor in other
parts of India have people real faith in non-violence or khadi. It is
true that I had deceived myself into believing that people were
wedded to non-violence with khadi as its symbol. As a matter of fact,
in the name of non-violence people manifested only the outward
peaceableness of the impotent. They never even attempted to drive
violence from their hearts. He who runs can see for himself the
verification of this fact. It had become patent to everyone, when I
went to Rajkot in connection with the Rajkot imbroglio, that there
was no Rama in Rajkot and, therefore, Kathiawar. Hence it is hardly
correct to say that their faith is only now beginning to wane.</p>

It is equally improper to question now the efficacy of non- violence
in matters political. What was the people’s fight against the
foreign power, if it was not a political matter? Indeed, the
disgraceful fight between brother and brother that we are wit nessing
today is much less political. Today, irreligion is stalking the
country in the name of religion. Even the outward peace that we were
able to observe</p>

The third error consist in the distinction the  correspondent makes
between Congressmen and Gandhians. The distinction is baseless. If
there is any Gandhian, it must be I. I am not so arrogant as to make
any such claim. A Gandhian means a worshipper of Gandhi. Only God has
worshippers. I have never claimed to be God. How then can I have
worshippers? Moreover, how can it be said that those who call
themselves Gandhians are not Congressmen? There are innumerable
servants of the Congress although they are not four anna members
registered in the Congress register. The reader should know that I
myself belong to that category. Hence the distinction made is false.</p>

I have repeatedly said that I have neither any part nor any say in
many things that are going on in the country today. It is no secret
that the Congress willingly said good-bye to non-violence  when  it
accepted power. Again I believe that the method of rationing of food
and clothing is highly injurious to the country. If I had my way, I
would not buy a grain of food-stuff from outside India. It is my firm
belief that even today there is enough food in the country. It has
been hidden because of the rationing. Again, if people followed me,
there would be no deadly quarrel between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims.
It is clear that my writ does not run any longer. Mine is a voice in
the wilderness.</p>

As for khadi, it has some kind of a place, if we separate it from
ahimsa. But it does not have the pride of place it would</p>

have had as a symbol of ahimsa. Those who are in the political field
wear khadi as a matter of convention. Today we see the triumph not of
khadi but of mill-cloth, for we have assumed that but for the
manufactures from our mills, millions would have to go naked. Can
there be a greater delusion than this? We grow enough cotton in the
country. We have any number of handlooms and spinning-wheels. India
is not unused to the art of hand-spining and hand-weaving, but
somehow or other the fear has seized us that the millions will not
take to hand-spinning and weaving hand-spun yarn for their own needs.
A haunted man sees fear even when there is no cause for it. And many
more die of fright than of the actual disease.</p>

the 27th of this month. The newspapers also said that I will be
inaugurating that conference. I knew nothing about it. Nor do I think
 I mentioned it to anyone. I asked one of the journalists how he got
that information. I told him to contradict the report. Our Labour
Minister Shri Jagjivan Ram had come to see me. I told him the same
thing. He said I had got to be present at the conference, and as it
would be a Monday and since I was already in Delhi, he thought there
was no need to ask my consent. Such are our newspapers. When I told
Jawaharlal that I might have consented by mistake, he was really
astonished. There is no need for me to go there at all, for I have
ceased to be useful for any purpose other than unity. Today I have
only one task before me, and even that is more than I can attend to.
I feel that if I succeed in that I shall have accomplished my life’s
mission. We all belong to the same country and let us all be one. If
all the Hindus, Sikhs, Muslim, Parsis and Christians remain united, I
shall not worry about anything else. They all belong to India and
they have to live here. Why then should they indulge in fighting?</p>

It is a great shock for a person, who has been dreaming of freedom
from his childhood days and who strove hard to achieve it, that when
freedom came, this poison has come along with it. This pains me very
much. What could be worse than this? I want to stop this evil. My
duty is but to try. I may succeed or I may not. “Let those who

I mentioned one thing yesterday about the people who have become
victims of leprosy. I referred to Jagadisan in that connection. He is
a great scholar. He used to suffer from this disease. He is not

considerable work among the lepers and takes much  interest.  He
mixes freely with them. He is of course a very hard-working man. He
lives in Madras, not in Wardha. But he has been there for the past
several days. He had corresponded with me about this matter. I got
his letter a few days ago, but I read it only today. I found in it
one suggestion, which I wish to explain to you. The gentleman has
said that the victim of leprosy should not be called a leper. People
give a bad meaning to that word and consider him even worse than an
untouchable. After all an untouchable does not harm anybody. We
believe that we become fallen by coming into physical contact with
the untouchables. I have already said that real leprosy is the
unclean state of mind. Hatred towards one’s fellow-beings and
speaking ill of the people of some community or class is a sign of
mental perversity which is worse than leprosy. If such people are
worse than the victims of leprosy, why should that name be attached
to the latter ? Let these people be described as victims of leprosy
and not as lepers. If people are believed to be bad because of a bad
name, they should not be called by such a name. You may call a rose
by any name, but that flower would never be without its
fragrance—even if it is called by the worst possible name. If this
is that Jagadisan says, he is right that there is not just one
disease which can be passed on to others by physical contact. If a
person suffering from scabies touches another person, he is likely to
pass on his disease. Leprosy is such a disease and is contagious like
cold, cholera, plague, etc. Why then should people suffering from
that disease be looked upon with contempt ? When a person gets really
affected by leprosy, people start looking at him with contempt. They
refer to him as a lowly creature. But real lowly creatures are those
who show contempt. We must get rid of this leprosy of contempt. That
is why I decided to talk again about this thing today.</p>

There seems to be a mania for establishing new universities in the
provinces. Gujarat wants one for Gujarati, Maharashtra  for Marathi,
Karnataka for Kannada, Orissa for Oriya, Assam  for Assamese and what
not. I do believe that there should be such universities if these
rich provincial languages and the people who speak them are to attain
their full height.</p>

At the same time I fear that we betray ourselves into undue haste in
accomplishing the object. The first stop should be  linguistic
political redistribution of provinces. Their separate administration
will naturally lead to the establishment of universities  where 
there  are none. The province of Bombay absorbs three languages :
Gujarati, Marathi and Kannada and, therefore, stunts their growth.
Madras absorbs four : Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada. Thus,
there is overlapping also. That Andhra Desha has an Andhra University
is true. I my opinion it does not occupy the place it would, if
Andhra was a separate administrative unit, free from foreign
control;. India attained that freedom only two months ago. The same
thing can be said of the Annamalai University. Who can say that Tamil
has come to its own in that University ?</p>

There should be a proper background for  new  universities. They
should have feeders in the shape of schools and colleges which will
impart instruction through the medium of their respective provincial
languages. Then only can there be a proper milieu. University is at
the top. A majestic top can only be sustained if there is a sound
foundation.</p>

the West. I do fear, however, that we are unable as yet to come to a
correct decision in the matter. It is to be hoped that no one
contends that because we seem to be politically free from foreign
domination, the mere fact gives us freedom from the more subtle
influence of the foreign language and foreign thought. Is it not
wisdom, does not duty to the country dictate, that before we embark
on new universities we should stop and fill our own lungs with the
ozone of our newly got freedom ? A university never needs a pile of
majestic buildings and treasures of gold and silver. What it does
need most of all is the intelligent backing of public opinion. It
should have a large reservoir of teachers to draw upon. Its founders
should be farseeing.</p>

In my opinion it is not for a democratic State to find money for
founding universities. If the people want them they will supply the
funds. Universities so founded will adorn the country which they
represent. Where administration is in foreign hands, whatever comes
to the people comes from top and thus they become more and more
dependent. Where it is broad-based on popular will, everything goes
from bottom upward and hence it lasts. It is good looking and
strengthens the people. In such a democratic scheme money invested in
the promotion of learning gives a tenfold return to the people even
as a seed sown in good soil returns a luxuriant crop. Universities
founded under foreign domination have run in the reverse direction.
Any other result was perhaps impossible. Therefore, there is every
reason for being cautious about founding new universities till India
has digested the newly acquired freedom.</p>

Then take the Hindu-Muslim question. The poison has assumed such
dangerous proportions, that it is difficult to forecast where it will
land us. Assume that the unthinkable has happened and that not a
single Muslim can remain in the Union safely and honourably and that
neither Hindu nor Sikh can do likewise in  Pakistan.  Our education
will then wear a poisonous form. If, on the other hand, Hindus,
Muslims and all the others who may belong to different faiths can
live in either Dominion with perfect safety and honour, then in the
nature of things out education will take a shape altogether pleasing.
Either people of different faiths having lived together in friendship
have produced a beautiful blend of cultures, which we shall strive to
perpetuate and increasingly strengthen, or we shall cast about for
the day when there was only one religion represented in Hindustan and
retrace our steps to that exclusive culture. It is just possible that
we might not be able to find any such historical date and if we do

we retrace our steps, we shall throw our culture back to that ugly
period and deservedly earn the execration of the universe. By way of
example, if we make the vain attempt of obliterating the  Muslim
period, we shall have to forget that there was a mighty Jama Masjid
in Delhi second to none in the world, or that there was a Muslim
University in Aligarh, or that there was the Taj in Agra, one of the
seven wonders of the world, or that there were the great forts of
Delhi and Agra built during the Mughal period. We shall then have to
rewrite our history with that end in view. Surely today we have not
the atmosphere which will enable us to come to a right conclusion
about the conflicting choices. Our two-months-old freedom is
struggling to get itself shaped. We do not know what shape it will
ultimately take. Until we know this definitely, it should be enough
if we make such changes as are possible in the existing universities
and breathe into our existing educational institutions the quickening
spirit of freedom. The experience we will thus gain will be helpful
when the time is ripe for founding new universities.</p>

Last but not least remains Basic Education. It is an infant not more
than eight years old. Therefore actual experience does not take us
beyond what may be termed the matriculation stagte. Thus, though it
is limited in scope, the mind of those who are engaged in making the
experiment has grown far beyond that stage. It would be unwise for
any educationist to put aside the recommendations of a body which has
behind it the solid experience of eight years. It should be borne in
mind that this Basic Education has grown out of the atmosphere
surrounding us in the country and is in response to it. It is,
therefore, designed to cope with that atmosphere. This atmosphere
pervades India’s seven hundred thousand villages and its millions
of inhabitants. Forget them and you forget India. India is not to be 
found in her cities. It is in her innumerable villages. The cities
rose in answer to the requirements of foreign domination. They exist
as they were two months ago, for though foreign rule has disappeared,
its influence has not and cannot quite so suddenly. Thus I am writing
these lines in New Delhi. If I know nothing of the villages of India
how can I draw, sitting here, a true picture of the villages ? What
applies to me applies more forcibly to the ministers.</p>

The communists have got hold of something to keep themselves busy.
Hardly one man in a thousand can be found who practises communism in
everyday life. Communists have come to consider it their supreme
duty, their supreme service, to create disaffection, to generate
discontent and to organize strikes. They do not see whom this
discontent, these strikes, will ultimately harm. Half knowledge is
one of the worst evils. The best is either full knowledge or
ignorance. We are thus caught in isms and take pride in them and
consider it a fashion to belong to this or that ism. People seek
knowledge and instruction from Russia. Our communists seem to be in
this pitiable state. I call it a pitiable rather than shameful state,
for I feel that they are to be pitied, rather than blamed. For,
because of our slavery, they have had no opportunity to get full
knowledge. And now when we have got our freedom everybody has got an
opportunity to thrust himself forward to such an extent that a
sixteen-year-old boy or girl can identify himself or herself with
some ism and become a leader. These people have now been fanning the
fire of disunity bequeathed to us by the British. Soon they will find
that they cannot control the flames. What we have to do is to find
out what will suit our ignorant masses and act accordingly. For
instance we need foodgrain. If the youth of the country would only
learn the techniques of farming and engaged themselves in producing
more food they would have no time for quarrelling and the country
would become prosperous.</p>

	I was very happy when I received the invitation to hold the prayer
	before the prisoners of this jail and to address them in my usual
	manner, after the prayer. All the prisoners are probably not aware
	that I am myself an old time prisoner right from my days in South
	Africa. I was not guilty from my point of view; but from the point
	of view of the Empire I was guilty. I have served all kinds of
	imprisonments and I have seen many jails. Jail rules in South Africa
	are very strict. And then the Indians count for nothing there. Even
	if one was a barrister, it made no difference. All Indians were
	considered coolies. There were the Indians on the one hand and
	Negroes on the other, and then the British—all living in their own
	worlds. When the satyagraha   started<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  thousands   of   satyagrahis   joined   it,   for  
	in   a satyagraha there would not be just a couple of persons. At
	the time of my   first   imprisonment<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
	     </font></sup>150   of   us   were  taken   prisoners.   In  
	the beginning there were not many people. I was there and four or
	five others were with me; but in due course our number grew to 150.
	We were all packed together in one ward along with the natives. We
	got quite fed up because of such crowding. I would like to tell you
	how strict the jail rules were and how ruthlessly they were
	observed. Here in India we make much fuss by making a distinction
	between political prisoners and criminals. No such distinction is
	made in South Africa. All prisoners are regarded as criminals there.
	I do not believe that among the prisoners political prisoners belong
	to a higher category and criminal prisoners belong to a lower
	category. In the eyes of the law, all those who have broken it are
	equally guilty. Why then distinguish between the guilty ones? But
	here we were not only political prisoners, but even belonged to A, B
	and C categories. Was it not because ours was a mighty struggle? We
	were millions in the field and among us there were also some big
	people. But who was big among those poor creatures there? They were
	all small business men. There were Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and
	others. Nobody made any</p>

distinction between Hindus, Muslims or Parsis. They were all called
coolies, or, say, Indians. So we could not even pose to be big and
insist on being put in A category and those who were lower in B and
the lowest in C category. I do not even believe in these divisions.
But here we did all that. I believe that anyone who goes to prison is
a prisoner.  I do not believe that a prisoner alone has committed a
crime and that those who are outside, well-dressed people, are not
guilty. I have been incarcerated ten times.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

do not remember exactly, but I have spent quite a few years in prison
and so I know about these things. The jail superintendents and others
had become my friends. There used to be a superintendent who was a
very good man and a great jailer. He once told me that he had been in
charge of prisoners but the world had no idea of the crimes he had
committed himself. He told me that the prisoners under him had come
to spend their four or five years of imprisonment or they had come
with death sentences which had been later condoned. But he woundered
how many ever knew the crimes he had committed. He said perhaps God
alone knew about his crimes. So he did not relish the idea that he
should be the chief jailer and those others should be prisoners. I
also share this belief of his. So I wondered with what attitude I
should come and meet you. The British rule has now ended. They have
withdrawn themselves. Itwas a nice thing they did. But what should we
do with our prisons now? I have been a witness to the conditions that
prevailed in the jails during the British days and I know very well
how good or bad they were. But now that the Government is in our own
hands, our prisons, far from remaining prisons, should become
hospitals. If somebody has committed a murder or a theft or turned an
outlaw, or committed any of the crimes mentioned in law books, I
consider all these to be a kind of disease. It is a malady. No one
commits a crime for its own sake. If</p>

somebody indulges in adultery or commits some other crime under the
influence of liquor, he does not do it for pleasure. Now that I have
grown old and have also acquired experience, I have realized that
man’s actions are guided by his nature. The prisoners should be
taught how they should live. The superintendent and the deputy
commissioner take care of the prisoners and order that such and such
a prisoner should be flogged or such and such a prisoner should do a
particular work by way of punishment. But I would suggest that the
superintendents and the deputy commissioners should  be  like
surgeons and doctors in hospitals and try to reform the prisoners as
a doctor would try to cure an alcoholic. the addict’s attention
should be drawn to all the evil effects of alcoholism. And supposing
somebody has kidnapped a girl—this is of course a grave crime—but
even he should be made to realize that what he did was a sort of
disease. If our jails could be so transformed, it would be a great
thing and all the prisoners also would be happy. But by being happy
they surely would not wish to remain in prison for ever. Do the
patients who go to hospitals wish to live there for ever? Moreover
hospitals have nice big buildings which is not the case with our
prisons here. How can we have such buildings for our prisons? Ours is
a poor country. We would go bankrupt if we started rebuilding our
prisons like palatial hospital buildings. Such prisons are not found
even in South Africa which is a land of gold. Even the prison cells
for the English prisoners there are not like palaces. England is a
rich country and hence it has such prisons. This I can say because I
have seen the British prisons. Of course I have not seen the prisons
in America. But we can at least make our prisons like hospitals where
doctors treat the patients. When a patient leaves the hospital after
recovering from an illness, he feels for ever grateful. The same
thing should happen in our prisons. Let the prisoners have no ground
to complain about the harsh treatment and atrocities in prisons or
about the wickedness of  the superintendents and jailers. Let them
not get a chance to say that everything was bad. Let them say that
they were looked after as if in a hospital, were fed properly and
taught how to lead a good life. I have already said what the people
in charge of the prisons should do. But ultimately it is not in their
hands to do that. It is for the Government to decide. Or, it is for
Panditji, the Sardar, say, the whole Cabinet, that is, the
Government, to do these things. But the Government must tell the
prison authorities that this is how they should behave. If the latter
then violate the rules and adopt tyrannical methods, that would be</p>

another matter. No criminal should be a jailer or superintendent or a
commissioner these days. We have at least learnt this and they all
work under the Government. The Government does not possess a large
army, nor can it seek outside help to discipline the officials. They
willingly obey the orders of their Government. Our entire
administration would collapse if they did not carry out orders
willingly and there would be chaos in the country. So, as for the
officials, I have said that they should not violate the law. And
there are some small things they can do without being instructed by
the Government. For instance, they should be kind to the prisoners.
What is there to learn in this? Let them regard prisons as hospitals
and prisoners as patients. If they did this much, at least one thing
would be accomplished.</p>

Now I wish to address myself to the prisoners as a prisoner. I have
also been imprisoned as a satyagrahi. A satyagrahi prisoner cannot
indulge in a deliberate crime. He would never harass the jail
superintendent or the jailer, or insult them. He has to be an ideal
prisoner. Then only can he carry on his satyagraha well. Even the
prisoners who have come here after actually committing crimes  should
become satyagrhis here. They should never defy the jail rules. They
should accept the restrictions of prison life and be content with
what they get. If the food given to the prisoners is not sufficient
or properly cooked or is found to contain extraneous substances like
grit and worms, they should complain to the superintendent or the
jailer. These things do happen. I have seen them with my own eyes
because I have lived in prisons. But even for these things why should
the jail officials be approached? These things are in the hands  of 
the  prisoners themselves, for there are no professional cooks in
prisons. The Government cannot manage the prisons if they start
keeping cooks. The prisoners themselves are made to cook. Let them do
the job with their hearts in it. Let them cook rice after cleaning it
well and let them not keep chapatis half-baked. All that is in your
own hands. You must do this work as if you were doing it in your own
homes. You have come here after committing some crimes. Anyone can
commit a crime. But some are detected, and some are branded guilty
without their having committed any crime. Such things do happen. I
think if you do this much, you can become ideal prisoners.</p>

Today a kind of poison has spread in our country. I hope that it will
not spread at least in the jails. You must come out of the prison as
ideal citizens. Then the Deputy Commissioner and the Jail Superin-
endent would tell me that I have done a good job. They would tell me
that their work has become easier, they are not being harassed and he
jail rules are being properly observed and all the prisoners are
making efforts every day to reform themselves. I would only pray to
God that you may become ideal prisoners and go out of here as ideal
citizens and try to stop the people outside from doing evil things.
You should tell them that they should forget that the Hindus are
enemies of the Muslims and the Muslims are the enemies of the Hindus.

Ahimsa is always tested in the midst of <i>himsa, </i>kindness in the

of hate. This is the eternal law. If on this auspicius day, we all

	At the outset I would like to reply to a gentleman’s question. He
	says: “You say that it is not good to harbour feeling of revenge.
	But don’t your followers who are devotees of Rama excite the
	feeling of revenge by burning Ravana’s effigy?” There are two
	fallacies in this. First of all, who are my followers? I do not even
	know about them. I should like to be a devotee of Rama. But I am not
	sure that I am. After all it is no easy thing to be a devotee or
	Rama. Hence it is wrong to refer to any devotees as my followers. I
	do not have any followers at all. But what happens is that people
	make an effigy of Ravana who is defeated by Rama. Thus we saw Rama
	vanquishing Ravana. But who amongst us is Rama and who is Ravana? If
	every man can become Rama, who would become Ravana? This is only a
	story in which Rama is portrayed as God and Ravana as His enemy.
	That is why Ravana has been described as inauspicious—a demon and
	an evil spirit, because he insisted on disregarding Rama and died
	without accepting Him. Then he had to die at the hands of God. This
	is a story. It does not</p>

mean that the effigy of Ravana is made with an idea of taking
revenge. The lesson I draw from it is that it teaches man not to take
revenge. Who would be more arrogant and foolish than I  if  I 
imagined myself to be Rama and other people sitting around here to be
Ravanas? How do I know I am Rama? Who knows how much wickedness is
hidden in me? Nobody knows whether I am a <i>mahatma </i><i>'</i>or a
wicked person in the eyes of God. I myself do not quite know how
wicked or good I may be. God alone knows it. He is far above us and
sees everything. Nothing is hidden from Him. Man cannot take revenge
on anyone. Even if someone has done any harm, what is the point in
taking revenge on him? Imagine a man as being perfect, though man can
never be perfect, for God alone can be perfect, but supposing there
is one human being who is perfect while others are imperfect, should
he then punish others or slay them? According to me, the making of
Ravana’s effigy on the Vijaydashami day means that it is not up to
human beings to take revenge. Even if we do not call it revenge, God
alone can harm or kill. Does it then mean that it is only for God to
employ violence as well as non-violence? God has no attributes and is
beyond all properties. To Him all these things mean nothing. But this
story is an illustration which points out that God alone can destroy
all the Ravanas in the world. Some people also presume that
Vijayadashmi tells them that they are perfect and others are
imperfect. Hence they take the law into their own hands and become
the lords of the world and start injuring and slaughtering people.</p>

All this is happening in India, too, because we have lost our senses.
From the reply I have given, you and the gentleman who put the
question will have understood that the Rama Ravana story teaches us
that we should not become sinful but be virtuous. Taking the name of
Rama on the one hand and indulging in acts of sin on the other is
abusing God.</p>

coerce Kashmir to join Pakistan. This should not be so. It is not
possible to take anything from anyone by force. I have no doubt about
it at all. Today it is Kashmir. Tomorrow it can be Hyderabad. Next it
may come to forcing Junagadh or some other State. I do not wish to
sit in judgment on this issue. I only believe in the principle that
nobody can force anyone.</p>

It makes no difference to me whether it is the question of Kashmir or
Hyderabad or Junagadh. Let no one be forced into any- thing. Let
there be no coercion. But I must respectfully submit that today
Kashmir is not ruled by its Maharaja. In other States too there are
no Princes as we used to know them. They were the creation of the
British. Now the British have gone. They had installed them as rulers
because they could rule through them and exercise power. Kashmir has
still to establish popular rule in the State. The same is the case
with other States like Hyderabad and Junagadh. In my view there is no
difference between them. Real rulers of the States are its people. If
the people of Kashmir are in favour of opting for Pakistan, no power
on earth can stop them from doing so. But they should be left free to
decide for themselves. The people cannot be attacked and forced by
burning their villages. If the people of Kashmir, in spite of its
Muslim majority, wish to accede to India no one can stop them.</p>

The Pakistan Government should stop its people if they are going
there to force the people of Kashmir. If it fails to do that, it will
have to shoulder to entire blame. If the people of the Indian Union
are going there to force the Kashmiris, they should be stopped, too,
and they should stop by themselves. About this I have no doubt at
all.</p>

I have discussed the problem of Kashmir with you. Now let me pass on
to another point. I have received a telegram from Calcutta. I think I
had told you about a Shanti Sena which was  formed  in Calcutta while
I was there. That was indeed a grace of God. It had appeared very
difficult to establish peace in Calcutta. But once the Shanti Sena
was formed, it was easily done, and neither the Hindus nor the
Muslims had to suffer much. Before that the Muslims had taken control
of big localities and were driving away the Hindus from there. Then
the Hindus also burnt the huts and other belongings of the Muslims
and also terrorized them. That should not have happened. I do not
want to go into the whole story. But when I went there, by the grace
of God the Shanti Sena was organized and students and others joined
it. Now they write to say that both Dussehra and Id were celebrated
with great enthusiasm and the Hindus and the Muslims have started
living like brothers. Id was celebrated in Calcutta</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
yesterday. But it is being celebrated in Delhi today. So the telegram
has been sent to me mentioning both Dussehra and Id. They say that
the Shanti Sena had spread out all over. There was no damage done
anywhere, either in calcutta or Howrah. Nobody was in a position to
harass anyone. And people lived without trouble on both the days.
They had even gone towards Dacca in East Bengal. I thought I should
tell you about this thing because I am happy if somewhere in India
the animosity between the Hindus and the Muslims ceases and instead
of remaining enemies they start living as brothers. And then Calcutta
is no small village. It is a city where business worth crores is
carried on. Huge freighters come to the Calcutta port and the city is
inhabited by the Hindus and the Muslims who do business. If we
started treating one another as enemies there, would not the entire
trade be destroyed? It is indeed very good if the Shanti Sena has
taught the people of Calcutta to live as brothers. Why should we not
learn a lesson from Calcutta? Why should we not have a Shanti Sena
here as well? Some Muslims came to me today on account of Id. They
know that I am not their enemy but their friend. I am a Hindu, and a
sanatani Hindu at that. That is why I am as much a Muslim as a Hindu.
Hence they came to me as to a friend. I did offer them Id greetings;
but I told them that really I had not the face to do so.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Even
today they live in great fear. They wonder if the Hindus would let
them stay here. Or would they be killed? Of course all the Hindus do
not kill. But they are in panic because many have been slaughtered.
What if they are few in number? Should the people of the majority
community attack and terrorize them? These atrocities have got to
end, otherwise we will perish.</p>

How nice it will be if we can do here what has happened in Calcutta.
Then my heart will dance with joy. Today my heart bleeds. I cannot
shed tears, because if I do so I shall not be able to do what I want
to. But there is sorrow in my heart. Are the Hindus and the Muslims
going to live like this in independent India? It is barbarous if
people belonging to the majority community attack the minority
community. No religion can be saved by attacking others. Religion can
be saved only by practising its teachings in life. There is no other
way.</p>

the State. The Secretary of the Harijan Sevak Sangh has written to me
that now no distinction will be made in the State between the
Harijans and other people. Along with the high castes, the Harijans
also entered the Maharaja’s temple. From now on untouchability will
cease to exist in all the State temples. And the Harijans will also
be able to draw water from the public wells. I was very happy to know
about all these things. If Hinduism has to make progress, how can
hatred and untouchability have any place in it? Untouchables are
those who are sinful. It is indeed a great stigma to make an entire
community untouchable. All traces of untouchability should be removed
from the heart of every Hindu. From every State ruled by the Hindus
untouchability should be removed as it is done in Ratlam. We would be
raising Hinduism very high thereby. If untouchability as we
understand it is banished from our hearts, are we going to make the
Muslims or some other people untouchables? What we are suffering
today is the consequence of the evil of untouchability. That is why
these developments in Ratlam have made me happy, and so I decided to
speak to you about the good things that have happened at Calcutta and
Ratlam.</p>

	Complaints are being repeatedly made that Muslims are being forced
	to leave their ancestral homes in the Union and migrate to Pakistan.
	Thus it is said that in a variety of ways they are being made to
	vacate their houses and live in camps to await dispatch by train or
	even on foot. I am quite sure that such is not the policy  of  the
	Cabinet. When I tell the complainants about this they laugh at it
	and tell me in reply that either my information is incorrect or the
	Services do not carry out the policy. I know that my information is
	quite correct. Are the Services then disloyal? I hope not. Yet the
	complaint is universal. Various reasons are given for the alleged
	disloyalty. The most plausible one is that the military and the
	police are largely  divided on a communal basis and that their
	members are carried away by the prevalent prejudice.</p>

It is suggested with much force that the popular Governments
established in the country have not the prestige that the ability to
overawe the Indian members of the Services gave the foreign
bureaucracy. This is only partly true. For the popular Government
wields a moral force which is infinitely superior to the physical
force that the foreign Government could summon to its assistance.
This moral force presupposes the possession of political morale that
popular support would give to an indigenous Government. It may be
lacking today. There is no means of checking it save by  the
resignation of the Ministry at the Centre.</p>

What we are examining specially this evening is the condition of the
Central authority. It must never be and, what is perhaps more
important, never feel weak. It must be conscious of its strength.
Therefore if it is at all true that there is the slightest
insubordination among the Services, the guilty ones must go; or the
Ministry or the Minister-in-charge must resign and give place to the
one who would successfully deal with official disorderliness.</p>

Whilst I voice, not without hesitation, the complaints that
persistently come to me, I must cling to the hope that they have no
basis and that if they have, the superior authority will
satisfactorily deal with them in so far as they have any
justification.</p>

What is the duty of the affected citizens of the Union? It is clear
that there is no law that can compel a citizen to leave his place of
residence. The authority will have to arm itself with special powers
to issue orders such as are alleged to have been given. So far as I
am aware there are no written orders issued to anyone. In the present
case thousands are involved in the alleged verbal orders. There is no
 helping those who will be frightened into submission to any order
given by a person in uniform. My emphatic advice to all such persons
is that they should ask for written orders whose validity in case of
doubt should be tested in a court of justice, if appeal to the final
executive fails to give satisfaction.</p>

will be difficult to rise. Let wisdom dawn on them while there is yet
time. Let them not be swayed by ugly events even when the report
thereof happens to be true. They must trust the representative
Ministers to do the needful for the vindication of justice.</p>

Some students from West Punjab and North-West Frontier Province also
study in that University. They could not reach the University and
those who are here cannot leave the place. Why should they not be
able to move freely? Now that Pakistan has been formed, does it mean
that the Muslims should go there and the Hindus and the Sikhs should
come here? The students wish to collect the blankets, etc., from
Muslims and distribute them among Hindu and Sikh refugees who are
facing hardships in the camps. Their intention is good and the
refugees need them too. If they receive these things, it would also
be an expression of love from Muslims. But really speaking, they
should go to Pakistan and ask the Muslims why the Hindus and the
Sikhs have to leave their homes at all. I have with me a whole pile
of papers full of complaints. Those complaints are not unfounded. Of
course I do feel that some exaggeration is quite possible in them.
But even if there is exaggeration, there is substantial ground for
those complaints. Why should the Hindus run away from their places?
Call them back. Why should they not come and live in their own
places?  If  the students are able to do this we can show to the
whole world that we had never indulged in mutual fighting. Then we
shall regain our honour which is sullied today. This is what I have
told those boys. They have agreed to what I have said. God alone
knows what they are going to do later on.</p>

But what I want to tell you today is something very important. I
think that while I was in Bihar people used to think that since they
had won freedom there was no need to buy tickets for travelling by
train. Not only this. They sometimes indulged in acts of
high-handedness and coercion. People did not indulge in mutual
fighting in those days, but now they think that having won their
freedom they need nothing more. I wrote quite a bit on the subject
and it did have some effect and such practices were given up. But now
for the past few days the situation has so developed that all over
the country people have started travelling without tickets. Even
well-to-do people have started thinking that they have become the
owners of the trains. The railways certainly belong to us now; but
the practice of ticketless travelling has resulted in a loss of Rs. 8
crores. And Rs. 8 crores is no small sum. Even Rs. 1 crore is no
small sum. How difficult it was and how many people had to go round
when we had to collect Rs. 1 crore for the Congress! I too went round
from house to house with the others to collect the funds. With great
difficulty we were able to collect that amount. The people of our
country are so poor. Today we spend a crore of rupees in no</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
time. If we get it we don’t even notice how it is spent. We still
do not know how to spend. We spend just because we have been put in 
charge of the work. If people start having free rides in trains or do
not buy tickets when travelling in connection with work, it is a kind
of violence. In my view it is plain robbery. At this rate India will
be reduced to utter poverty and we shall be left without railways or
anything else. Then we shall feel sorry wondering how we can travel.
Eight crore rupees do not make a small sum after all. In former days
the railways could earn interest on their capital out of their
earnings. Millions of people travel by trains. If everybody pays his
fare the railways can earn quite a lot. There used to be ticketless
travellers even in those days; but not in thousands as today. There
used to be inspectors on the trains and the accounts used to be
properly kept. But now the situation is such that the guards and the
drivers are attacked. Expenditure is going up day by day. Trains
cannot be run for charity. The railway employees cannot agree to
forgo their salaries because the passengers do not pay their fares.
What will they eat if they do not have their salaries? Thus the
expenditure on railways is millions and it also earns millions. The
railways incurred no loss in former days. Earnings from third-class
passengers used to be considerable, because the expenditure on them
used to be little. But I was pained to hear yesterday about the loss
of Rs. 8 crores. Nothing good can come to us if there is going to be
such looting all sides. On top of this we indulge in mutual fighting
and killing and plundering. These things do no good to anyone and
result in loss of crores of rupees. When people are asked to leave
their homes and go away to Pakistan, they surely do not go without
taking anything. They have to be fed and clothed. We have to incur
all that expenditure for nothing. After all, India is not a country
of the rich that it can go on spending at this rate. That is
impossible. Hence even if there is a single person travelling by
train, let him not travel without paying his fare. He must pay his
fare. During the British days, police constables and other officials
used to swallow up considerable amount of money. I know about this
because I have been a third-class traveller. In those days when I had
gone to Hardwar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>for
the Kumbh Mela, I found that nobody could get there without paying
some extra money to the station master. In this way, thousands of
rupees went by way of bribes. Now I feel that everybody</p>

has become quite honest. The station masters, signalmen, inspectors,
guards, etc., should take only their legitimate dues and live only by
that. They should not grab money from people.  The  passengers should
consider the railways as their own property. They should keep the
trains clean. They should not spit and smoke in the trains and should
not pull the chain without real need. And not a  single passenger
should travel without ticket. Then I would be able to say that we
have attained true independence. Here there are not thousands of
people to hear me, and so who would carry my words to those hundreds
of thousands of people who travel by trains? Had I been a railway
manager or a railway minister I would have given orders to people
working under me to tell the passengers that though they  would not
be physically manhandled, the railways belonged to them and the
railway officials were their servants, they would not be permitted to
travel without paying the fares. Even if the  train  is passing
through a forest, the railway authorities would stop the train right
there. If the passengers still did not come round they would order
the driver to detach the engine from the train and drive it away.
Then there would be no occasion for abusing people or using force
against them; the train just would not move till the passengers paid
the fare. This method should be followed as long as the passengers
travel without tickets. After all, it is not proper to board the
train without tickets, to indulge in violence and stop the train just
anywhere one likes. What I have told you is happening in India. But I
have heard that in Pakistan too people travel in trains without
tickets just as here. And why should they not do so? After all we
were all born in the same environment, have eaten the same salt, then
why should not the same things happen there as here? But if things
continue in this manner, both the countries will go bankrupt. If we
travel by train without buying tickets, take bribes wherever we can
and go on beating up people, we will end up as robbers. The respect
we have acquired by becoming independent will be completely lost.
Hence let as many people as possible and the Minister listen to what
I am saying, because  I am saying as an experienced man, that if this
trend does not stop you will have to stop running the trains. The
trains will not move and in the trains that move no passenger will be
allowed to travel without paying his fare.</p>

	Today you have heard a very sweet <i>bhajan</i>. The person who sang
	that beautiful <i>bhajan </i>may not be known to all of you. His
	name is Dilip Kumar Roy. He has visited many places. Few persons in
	India possess the melodious voice he has. I would even say that very
	few in the world have a voice like his. He came to me in the
	afternoon. I could not spare much time then. I could give just 10
	minutes. He sang <i>Vandemataram</i>, which he has set to music, in
	his melodious voice. He must know this song because he is a Bengali.
	I heard him because he wanted to sing for me. I am no expert in
	music. He has an affection for me which people mutually develop.
	Then he sang for me <i>Sare </i><i>jahanse achchha </i>of Iqbal. He
	has set that also to a new tune.  I enjoyed it very much. He has
	been staying at Rishi Aurobindo’s Ashram at Pondicherry for the
	past several years. He has not taken any training there. He has been
	a musician even when he went there. Later he developed his art.</p>

	The inner meaning of the <i>bhajan </i>is as Kabir says: “While
	you possess elephants and horses and wealth worth crores, my only
	possesstion is the name of Murari<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
	</font></sup>. But having that name I am rich and all the wealth
	lying in your possession is worthless. That wealth is transient. But
	what I possess can never be taken away from me. The <i>bhajan </i>only
	shows the greatness of Ramanama. And what the <i>bhajan </i>says you
	have already heard. But you must also know about the Aurobindo
	Ashram. As it is, there is a continuous stream of visitors to the
	Ashram. A large number of people go there. Shri Aurobindo has many
	devotees. There is no hatred for anyone there, whether Hindu or
	Muslim or somebody else. I have seen that the late Sir Akbar Hydari
	used to visit the Ashram every year. Shri Aurobindo is a humble
	devotee. He does not meet anyone. But people visit him, whether they
	can or cannot have his <i>darshan</i>. They also entertain no
	feeling of hatred for anyone. Let us learn at least this much that
	we should not</p>

But today I wish to talk about what is happening in Kashmir. And I
must talk about it. You already know what is appearing in the
newspapers. It is an astounding story. It happened three days ago.
Nobody knew anything about it. Even I did not know what was going to
happen. But one might say what has happened has happened. At the
moment it is being said that the Afridis, and others have infiltrated
there carrying arms with them. Some people even say that it is a
mischief done by the Pakistan Government. It may be so, but I am not
concerned with it. I am observing what is happening there. On the one
side the invaders have gone right up to Punj and have further reached
within 22 miles of Srinagar. From there it is a straight road with no
obstructions for them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 1.03cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
When the Maharaja of Kashmir saw this he announced his decision to
accede to the Indian Union. The Maharaja wrote a letter to Lord
Mountbatten who welcomed his decision.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>Now that he has taken refuge in the Indian Union he
should be protected. But how could protection be given to him? Help
could not be sent by road, but only by air. How many soldiers could
be sent by plane? Only a few could be sent. Then they have to carry
their arms, food supplies and clothes. And their clothes have got to
be thick and heavy. Even an excess of one pound of weight becomes an
extra burden. When the planes fly in the sky like birds, how many
soldiers can go in them? About 1,000 or at the most 1,500 would have
gone. On the one hand there are 1,500 soldiers and on the other a
large number of men who have come from the North-West Frontier
Province. Those men are also of a fighting stock and they are
fighting. What can you or I think about it? After all, I have spent
my life thinking over these things. I do not believe in armed
fighting but I must know what it is. On the one hand are 1,500 Indian
soldiers and on the other all those Afridis and others. And there is
Sheikh Abdullah. He is called the “Lion of Kashmir”. That is, he
is like a tiger or a lion. He is a sturdy man. You must have seen his
photograph. I know him and his Begum also. She is here these days. He
is doing whatever a single individual can do. He is not a soldier.
There are strong and sturdy Muslims in Kashmir and also strong and
sturdy Hindus, Rajputs and Sikhs. So he has decided to do his utmost.
He is a Muslim. Kashmir has a large Muslim population.</p>

From here the soldiers have gone fully armed but what should the
local Muslims do? Granted that we have all become barbarians—
whether here or in Pakistan, no act of madness is left undone—should
the people in Kashmir also turn barbarians and indulge in
indiscriminate killing of women and children? Should Kashmir be
reduced to such a terrible state? Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and his
Cabinet came to the conclusion that something should be done and
those soldiers were sent. What should they do? Let them fight to the
end and die fighting. The job of armed soldiers is to march ahead and
repel the attacking enemy. They die in fighting but never retreat.
God alone knows what the outcome will be. As it is stated in the
<i>bhajan</i>, our only wealth is Murari. Our wealth does not consist
in money piled up in crores. Even the arms are not our wealth.
Whatever is to be done is done only by God. But our duty is to make
efforts. And that we should do. So these 1,500 soldiers have made an
effort. But they will have really done their duty when all of them
lay down their lives in saving Srinagar. And with Srinagar the whole
of Kashmir would be saved. What would happen after that?</p>

All that would happen would be that Kashmir would belong to the
Kashmiris. I fully agree with Sheikh Abdullah who says that Kashmir
belongs to the Kashmiris and not to the Maharaja. But the Maharaja
has given all powers to Sheikh Abdullah, leaving it to the Sheikh’s
discretion to do whatever should be done and save Kashmir if he can.
After all, Kashmir cannot be saved by the Maharaja. If anyone can
save Kashmir, it is only the Muslims, the Kashmiri Pandits, the
Rajputs and the Sikhs who can do so. Sheikh Abdullah has affectionate
and friendly relations with all of them. It is possible that while
saving Kashmir, Sheikh Abdullah would have to sacrifice his life, his
Begum and his daughter would have to die and all women of Kashmir
would have to die. And, if that happens, I am not going to shed a
single tear. If we are fated to have a war, there will be a war. God
alone knows, if it is going to be a war between the two only or
others too would be involved. If the aggressors have no support or
encouragement of Pakistan, I do not know how they can hold on. Maybe,
there is no such encouragement. If the people of Kashmir die in the
fighting, who would be left behind? Sheikh Abdullah would have gone,
because his lion-heartedness consists in dying while  fighting and
saving Kashmir to his last breath. He would have saved the Muslims
and also the Sikhs and the Hindus. The Sheikh is a devout Muslim. His
wife also offers <i>Namaaz </i>. She had recited Auz-o-</p>

Billahi to me in her melodious voice. I have even gone to his house.
He would not let the Hindus and the Sikhs there die before the
Muslims. What if the Hindus and the Sikhs are in a minority there? If
this is the attitude of the Sheikh and if he has influence  on  the
Muslims, all is well with us. The poison which has spread amongst us
should never have spread. Through Kashmir that poison might be
removed from us. If they make such a sacrifice in Kashmir to remove
that poison, then our eyes also would be opened. The tribesmen are
only interested in killing. So they invaded Kashmir and even showed
their strength. I know all who are with them. But the result would be
that if all the Hindus and Muslims of Kashmir sacrificed their lives,
that would open our eyes also. Then we would know that not all
Muslims were insincere and bad, there were some good men also among
them. Similarly it is not true that all Hindus and Sikhs are either
good and saintly or worthless and kafirs. I believe that there are
good people among all, Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs. And it is due to
these good people that the world goes on—not due to the people
carrying arms.</p>

This is the substance of the melodious <i>bhajan </i>we have heard
today. I shall dance with joy even if everybody in Kashmir has to die
in defending his land. There would be no sorrow in my heart. The
world would go on as usual. All this is the play of God. But we have
always to make the effort and that consists in dying while doing the
right thing.</p>

If I cannot convince the top leaders of the Congress who have been my
co-workers for the last thirty years, I ask myself, ‘Where do I
stand?’ You are in such a pitiable condition that you have come to
me for guidance asking in which city of India you can stay peacefully
and your children can have education. I pity you but I feel most
unhappy with myself and wonder why I was so blind all this while.
What I considered as the non-violent force of the brave was in fact
passive resistance of the weak! You have come away with your families
leaving thousands of your brothers and sisters because you got an
opportunity or, allow me to say it, you somehow managed to escape.
How could you desert those who trusted you and plunged themselves in
the satyagraha struggle under your leadership? I don’t find fault
with you. But you have come out in your true colours and also made me
realize that I had followed the wrong path. But I am an optimist.</p>

faith and hope. God is really testing me, and if I am sincere in my

my faith in Ramanama, I will, if I can do nothing else, cheerfully
sacrifice myself in this <i>yajna </i>of unity with the name of the

You are just like children to me. Now that you have come to seek my
advice, I wish to tell you that you should give up the temptation to
settle in a city. If you do not have the necessary courage to go back
to Sind, go to the villages with your families and take up some
constructive activity. Once you give up this fascination [for cities]
you will realize how much you and your families will rise [by living
in the villages]. I can only express my view, but you don’t have to
do anything to please me. Follow the dictates of your heart, only
then will you bring credit to yourselves. You will be thoroughly
confused if you keep thinking what Bapu likes or does not like and I
will not be able to ascertain the true state of affairs and the whole
atmosphere will become artificial. I hope you know how much harm
false pretences can do.</p>

	I was aware of what had been happening here. It pained me very much.
	Here I wish to make it clear that Birla Bhavan is the house of a
	private individual. Nothing unbecoming should happen here. Those who
	wish to come are welcome, but after coming here it is not good
	manners to raise any objection. Today a gentleman said that he would
	not allow the prayer to take place. I wonder whether I should hold
	the prayer at all under the circumstances. The person who raised the
	objection went away because you told him to go. He returned and left
	again. This is not a good thing for me. It means that he is pained
	at heart. That way I think many of you must be  pained  because  a
	portion from the Koran is included in the prayer. But I am helpless
	because it is an inseparable part of my prayer. Do you think I shall
	not pray if the prayer is not held here? On the one hand my duty
	tells me that I should pray. It is not that I shall cease to pray if
	I do not hold the prayer here. I shall pray even if there is none in
	the world to stand by me. One can pray within one’s heart. Here I
	have to think from the point of view of non-violence. I must see my
	duty only in that light. I do not like that a man should go away in
	order that I might hold the prayer. I do not wish to hold the prayer
	today, nor enter into an argument, still I will because we are
	passing through a critical time and people are eager to hear what
	Gandhi has to say. I also wish to speak so that at least people
	might understand what I wish to tell them. But today I will not
	enter into an argument, because I am helpless.</p>

truth and non-violence. If you realize the meaning of truth and non-
violence, great things can be done in the world. I do not wish to
indulge in any big talk. Great things happen in the world. But who
can change the Law of God? And God cannot change the laws of the
world. I think we are all steeped in pride and ignorance and hence
believe that truth is too great a thing to be applied to trade and
business and in practical life. We wonder how non-violence can work.
It is asked when somebody abuses twice, why not abuse him at least
once and if somebody abuses why not retort by slapping him? But if we
follow such a path, we can make no progress. And we do want to make
progress. This, according to me, is the purpose of human life. I
cannot remain still. Only God is immovable. But it is stated in the
Upanishads that though God is immovable he is also moving. He is
always moving—and He moves in such a way that that motion gives the
impression of stillness. Did we know that the sun is stationary and
the earth moves? But now we have learnt that what appears to be
moving is stationary. Such is the creation of God. God alone is
immovable and also moving. We are never still. We are always moving,
and since we are moving we have to go ahead. We come out of our
mother’s womb and grow. In the course of time we grow old. That is
the way of life. One who is born has to grow and march forward and he
does go forward. Some people think old age is decline. But that is
not my view. Old age is like the ripened fruit. That which is
destroyed is body, not soul. The soul does not perish, nor does it
decay. The soul is always in a process of evolution. And in this
world we cannot live without truth and non-violence. Even today I
claim that truth and non-violence should be learnt even by children.
If the mother learns these things she can teach them to her children
also. The mother cannot learn these things in an instant. But it is
said that man has been in existence from the beginning of time, since
millions and millions of years. We should consider our progress in
that context. For that we must have patience. I do not wish to say
anything more on this point; but nothing can be done without truth
and non-violence. We cannot make any progress without them.</p>

I do not wish to enter into a discussion today. You would be coming
tomorrow also. If tomorrow also anyone raises an objection to the
recitation from the Koran I shall decide whether I should discuss the
matter. If anyone has got an objection he will say so, otherwise they

others should know that they should not get angry. If later some-</p>

body decides not to allow the people to listen to the prayer and
starts shouting, maybe your violence will be provoked, and my non- 
violence will be put to test. It will also show how far you can go
with me. If you will stand by me and adhere to non-violence, I can
say with certainty that violence cannot remain unaffected before
non-violence. But the condition is that you must do as I say. You
must tell me that you will exercise restraint and will not be carried
away by anger. That gentleman who protests against the recitation
from the Koran is ignorant. What harm has the Koran-e-Sharif done? If
the Muslims here have gone astray it does not mean that the Koran is
at fault. The Koran written in Arabic is sublime and eternal. I do
not think anyone can be more ignorant than one who shows contempt for
the Koran. You must convince the man who objects, in this manner. Of
course, if somebody says that he does not want to listen to the
prayer at all, I will have the prayer and also make the speech. But I
cannot tolerate that you should beat up anybody because I discontinue
the prayer. If I am left alone and five persons come up to me wanting
to kill me, I would say that my head is ready for them. I would ask
why there should be five persons to do that. Even a single man could
cut my throat. But still I would hold the prayer. When one’s heart
is filled with such feelings, one would neither kill a person nor be
angry with him. Even if the person raising an objection, whom we
could call an uncultured man, shouts at the top of his voice, we will
have our prayer. Tomorrow we shall have the prayer as well as the
speech. If anyone raises an objection tomorrow, let him do so and
leave. I do not wish to ruin myself for his sake. I can carry on my
work only by controlling my anger and being patient. Today this is
all I wish to say. Now please go home quietly without arguing among
yourselves. Think over this at home.</p>

for so much? What does our duty dictate? There is no question of
leaving Noakhali. The only question is whether or not we can be self-
supporting there, whether the Hindus of Noakhali can bear our
expenses. After all, our expenses will not be much. The expense on
refugees should be kept separate. My advice is that you think over
all this and meet Pyarelal, Jiwan Singh, Kanu and the people at
Sodepur and let me know. We must not accept defeat. We should not be
short of funds. All good causes get money, that is, there is no need
to make special efforts for it. I think I must have been at fault
somewhere.</p>

	In my view, disappointing 300 persons for the sake of two or three
	is also a kind of violence. These people certainly have a right to
	protest, but courtesy demands that they should not exercise that
	right in this place which personally belongs to Birla. But who can
	stop them if they do so? In that case, the remaining members of the
	audience must put up with them. Let them not be angry with the
	persons who are protesting or say anything to them either here or
	outside. I shall carry on the prayer and the recitation from the
	Koran if you are agreeable to this. Because you are in the majority,
	you should not think that you can ignore the people who are
	protesting. If you think you can ignore them, you would be following
	the path of violence. We must be more concerned about the people who
	 are  in  the minority. This is what I have been trying to teach all
	along. In future too I shall, above anything else, try to teach how
	non-violence works.</p>

	The basic principles of truth and non-violence are not difficult to
	understand. No special degree is needed to learn those principles.
	Why talk of English, we need not learn even our own mother tongue
	for it. Whatever is needed for the purpose we learn from our parents
	in childhood. Practising those principles is even easier. Hence, if
	you can put up with this much of protest, I shall have the prayer in
	spite of the protest. Courtesy demands that if anyone is against the
	recitation from the Koran, he should express his view and leave; he
	may explain to me later in what way I am harming the Hindu religion.
	I am a sensible man. If, therefore he is able to convince me, I
	shall accept his view. Personally, I think I have only done some
	good to Hinduism. I am not doing this only today—I have been doing
	this for a long time and, I think, Hinduism has not been tarnished
	in any way. Through this practice of reciting from the Koran I am
	able to draw my Muslim friends nearer to me. I have not done
	anything wrong in this. How nice it would be if I could in the same
	manner draw the whole world to me and there were none who was my
	enemy or opponent! But how can that be? I am not so perfect that no

If things go on like this, the result is bound to be good. In today’s
prayer Shri Dilip Kumar Roy sang: “Let there be love in the temple
of your heart.” I was pleased by his melodious voice and his art of
singing. The sentiment expressed is nothing uncommon but the way it
was presented is what we call art. The <i>bhajan </i>says that we
should make our heart like a temple and install love in it. So this
also teaches us non-violence. The composer of this <i>bhajan </i>asks
man why he should behave like a foolish and ignorant man. He says
that if one can light the lamp of love even if only in the temple of
one’s heart, one will have won the goal of one’s life. After that
he will see light and brightness in the whole world. There will be no
 darkness anywhere. Similar miraculous power is to be found in truth
and non- violence. This is a very simple and obvious thing. But if we
learn even this much, our task in the world will become easier.</p>

I found in Noakhali that the rich had run away from there, leaving
the poor behind. The villages in that area are full of people whom
we, in our foolishness, call untouchables. As I have toured the area,
I know that the people there are very much in distress. The women in
that place had even forgotten to wear bangles or apply <i>sindoo</i><i>r</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>.  Even  among  the  people  who  have  come  here  from
  the Punjab and elsewhere I have found that the people with
financial resources somehow carry on some occupation or the other.
They have money and they also acquire friends. But what can the poor
do? Where can they go? In Noakhali there were only the Hindus who
were in distress; but in Bihar I found the Muslims also in distress.
I told them that those who were dead among them were dead and gone
and those who had money and wished to go away could do so, but as for
the poor, God alone was their protector. But God does not work with
His own hands or mouth. He inspires people and gets His work done
through them. But should the rich become such hard-hearted</p>

There are a large number of poor people in the refugee camps in
Delhi. There are some rich people too and among them there are some
nice people who first feed the poor before eating themselves. That is
why I say that the people who have come here should not discriminate
between the rich and the poor. If the rich look upon the poor with
contempt they will be not religious but irreligious. That is why I
would plainly say that the rich should keep the poor along with them.
Then alone can we live together in peace and unity.</p>

Recently a European couple visited some of our camps. They were happy

There are still a large number of Muslims in Delhi. I have seen a
list today which, if there is no exaggeration, indicates that
hundreds of Muslims have been forcibly converted to Hinduism or
Sikhism. I would like to tell the people who have been subjected to
forcible religious conversion that even though they have changed
their Muslim appearance, if God is installed in their hearts there is
no need to shave off their beards or to keep a tuft of hair. Those
who wish to read the <i>Gita </i>of their own accord may do so by all
means. It should be in the spirit in which I read the Koran and
derive inner joy. But if somebody compelled me to read the Koran and
threatened me with death if I did not oblige, I would say that I had
no need of the Koran even if it contained jewels. That is why I would
tell those Muslims who have become Hindus or Sikhs that they must
stick to their religion. If we compel them to follow our religion, we
are destroying Hinduism.  Such a thing cannot go on in India forever,
and if it does, it will ruin us, and we will lose our independence. I
have no doubt that in that case our independence will have become a
mere dream. That is why I would like to tell all the Muslims here
that they should live without</p>

fear. Those who have changed their religion should say that they were
in panic at that time, but now they have realized that people who
have faith in God are never afraid, and, if at all, they are afraid
only of God. It is a good thing to be afraid of God because He is the
abode of love, an ocean of compassion. If we are afraid of God we are
blessed. But we should never be afraid of man. Hence they would say
that they would rather die than change their religion. They can tell
the Hindus that the latter might send them to Pakistan if they
wished, but cannot drive them out through force.</p>

It is agreed between Liaquat Ali and our Prime Minister that those
who wish to go to Pakistan are free to leave, but even Liaquat Ali,
the Sardar and Jawaharlal cannot force anybody. There is no such law.
So we should keep with love the Muslims who are here. If I am alive,
I do not wish to see anything else. There was a time when I cherished
the desire to live for 125 years; but now I have given up that
desire. If India is destined for bad times, let God take me away. And
if India is destined to be great and the situation is going to
change, as it should, let God change the hearts of the Muslims and
fill them with thoughts of God. They do take the name of God but they
are not doing His work. Similarly, if the Hindus take the name of
Krishna or Rama but indulge in killing, their taking those names has
no meaning.</p>

Some people say the war has started and they wonder what is going to
happen in Kashmir. I say nothing is going to happen. The people of
Kashmir are brave. The Hindus, Muslims and the Sikhs are living there
in unity. The invaders should be told by the Kashmiris that they
should go back to their homes. If they are going to attack, they will
have to march on their dead bodies. They cannot win  Srinagar so
easily. Then nobody will touch our soldiers there. If they die, they
will become immortal. Then we can dance with joy and sing. If such a
situation arises there, I would ask Shri Dilip Kumar Roy to sing such
a <i>bhajan </i>that people would start dancing—because those who
would have died would become immortal and those surviving would be as
good as dead. I would not be pained at all about this. Of course, I
would be pained if people here lost their senses and Pakistan also
went mad. The Afridis are like our brothers and the North-West
Frontier Province is our own. Then why should they indulge in such
acts? We should know who is giving them help. I would only pray that
God may dwell in their hearts and the temples of their hearts be

should not matter that the Qaid-e-Azam believes the Hindus and the
Muslims of India to be two nations or that there are Hindus too who
entertain the same belief. Surely, it does not follow that because
the whole world is in error, we, who believe otherwise, should follow
it. This should never happen.</p>

If Hindustani is taken to be the inter-provincial language of India,
it follows that both the scripts, Nagari and Urdu, should be equally
acceptable. If the State recognizes only  Nagari  as  the character
in which Hindustani should be written, it would certainly by unjust
to our Muslim brethren and when it is remembered that they are a
minority the guilt is enhanced.</p>

I have never contended that all the forty crores of Indians have to
learn both the scripts. I have, however, held that those who have
inter-provincial contacts and who want to serve not merely their own
province but the whole of India should know both the scripts. The
reason is obvious. They ought to be able to read  letters  written
whether in the Nagari or the Urdu script. Hence, it is necessary that
both the scripts are accepted as national.</p>

If Hindi is to be the national language, naturally Nagari alone will
be the national script and if Urdu is to take that place, Urdu script
alone will be the national script. But, if Hindustani, which is a
resultant of the junction of Hindi and Urdu, is to be the national
language, a knowledge of both the scripts is essential in the manner
indicated by me.</p>

It is worth remembering that in reality neither the Urdu character
nor the Urdu form of the same language is the exclusive property of
the Muslims of India. There is quite a large number of Hindus and
others whose mother tongue is Urdu and who know only the Urdu
character. It is further to be remembered that the necessity of
knowing both the scripts was stressed by me on my return from South
Africa in 1915. I submitted the same proposition to the Hindi Sahitya
Sammelan in Indore as its President.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>So
 far  as  I   recollect, there was hardly any opposition to the
proposition. It is true that then I did not suggest any alteration in
the name<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

today. When perfect anarchy prevails in the thought world and we
express different views without regard to facts, it is obligatory
that we should have one helm to weather any storm.</p>

In so far as it is believed that the Muslims only are concerned with
the retention of the Urdu character, at this juncture it becomes our
special duty to emphasize the necessity of Hindustani written in
either character. This should appear self-evident. Whatever were the
reasons in justification, it must be admitted that within the Union
in many places the Muslims have been dealt with harshly. It would be
beside the point to contend that Pakistan made the beginning with
harsh treatment against the Hindus and the Sikhs. For the State to
ordain that the inter-provincial script in the Union shall be only
the Nagari, it would be an imposition upon the Muslims. If the result
of the act of justice is to be that the Muslims are to confine
themselves to the Urdu character and gratuitously regard the word
Hindustani as synonymous with Urdu, it would amount to cussedness and
perhaps a sign that their hearts are not in the Union.</p>

It would be confusion of thought for Raihanabehn to argue that
keeping of the Urdu character side by side with the Nagrai would be
construed to be in pursuance of the policy of appeasement. Though the
word has come to have a bad odour about it, I would submit that
appeasement can be a praiseworthy duty, as it can also be at times a
blameworthy gesture. Thus, for instance, it can conceivably be a duty
on the part of a brother to walk with his brother towards the North
whilst alone he would have gone to the South. But it would certainly
be criminal for him, a confirmed teetotaller, to drink spirituous
liquors with his drunken brother in order to appease him. He would
then harm both himself and his brother. I must not recite the <i>Klama
</i>in order to appease or flatter my Muslim brother, as he must not
recite the  <i>Gayatri</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 
 </font></sup>in order to appease or flatter me. It would be another
matter if both of us recite either at will because we believe the two
incantations as one in essence. I hold that it is so. Hence it is
that in the daily recital of the Ashram prayers, among the eleven
observances occurs equal respect for all the accepted religions in
the world. The upshot of all this argument is that the policy of
appeasement is not always bad. It may even become a duty at times.</p>

This sister further says that the Nagari script is, comparatively
speaking, fairly perfect, whereas the Urdu script is imperfect and
difficult to decipher. To write Sanskrit words in Urdu script is, she
holds, well nigh impossible. There is some force in these three
statements. They amount to this that the Devanagari script though</p>

comparatively perfect admits of improvement and the Urdu script
demands it because it is imperfect. It will be difficult for
Raihanabehn to sustain the charge that it is not possible to write
Sanskrit words in the Urdu script. I have in my possession the whole
of the <i>Gita </i>transcribed in that script. Improvement is
possible only when fanaticism has died out. After all, what is the
Sindhi alphabet but an improved edition of the Urdu script?</p>

Lastly, I suggest to Raihanabehn that her letter under  dis-  cussion
is a fine specimen of Hindustani. She has woven in that letter Urdu
words as freely as Sanskrit words. The beauty of Hindustani is that
it has no quarrel either with sanskrit or with Arabic words. In order
to strengthen Hindustani consistently with its genius, if a language
can be said to have a ‘genius’, it must borrow from all the
languages of the world. Its grammar must remain as it always has been
in indigenous Hindi. Thus the plural of ‘Hindu’ in Hindustani
will always be Hindu-o ( 
<img align="BOTTOM" border="0" height="18" src="gandhi_vol97_html_79e2d3e2.png" width="43"/>)
 and not Hunud ( 
<img align="BOTTOM" border="0" height="13" src="gandhi_vol97_html_m625670c.png" width="26"/>)
as it is in highly Arabicized Urdu. Raihanabehn is an Urdu scholar.
Though not a scholar in Hindi , she knows it well. She reads and
writes both the Nagari and Urdu characters. When I was in the Yeravda
prison she and Zohra Ansari<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>were
my Urdu teachers. Naturally, they taught me through correspondence.
My advice, therefore, to her is that she  should devote her energy to
the strengthening and spreading of Hindustani and making the teaching
of the two characters as easy as possible. This work she can only do,
if her ignorance, as I call it, is removed. If what she has now begun
to believe is true, I could have nothing to say to her. Then indeed,
I shall have to unlearn the past and learn a new lesson and displace
the Urdu character from the position which I think it should occupy.</p>

angry at heart, I feel happy when that anger is expressed in a

Today also you heard a <i>bhajan </i>in the same melodious voice. Is
it not said in the <i>bhajan </i>that “we belong to a land where
there is no sorrow and no suffering”? Then the <i>bhajan </i>also
says that “there is no illusion and no greed, and such other
enemies of ours are also not there”. But where can we find such a
land? On an earlier occasion when Sucheta Devi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>had
 sung   that  <i>bhaja</i><i>n</i><i> </i>for  us  I  had  given  two
interpretations.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>My first interpretation was that the poet had India in
his mind. He had a wish, a dream of what he would like his country to
be. But that is not the situation at present. The <i>bhajan </i>was
composed before August 15, but such was not the condition even then.
Anger, greed, attachment, pride, infatuation, jealousy, all these six
enemies of man were there. There six include all other enemies of
humankind. Then there was hunger and there was poverty and there were
no clothes to wear—we were then surrounded by all those troubles.
But did the poet not wish that his country should be free from those
troubles? But how could our country be free from these troubles? This
calls for the second interpretation. Is this not the country which
has   been   described   in   the   <i>Gita   </i><i> </i>as

country without misery and sorrow. But I have never found our country

my childhood days does not depict India as I find her today. This

idle she said she would do something. So she also went there. That
lady doctor told me today that people did receive medical attention
there but there were not enough doctors. So many people have been
crowded into that place and there is so much hardship and suffering
that two or three lady doctors are not enough. A large number of
doctors in needed there. If doctors go there they will be of some
help. They are not quacks like me. They should have allopathic

to rejoice over it, but on the condition that everybody, young and
old, should die there valiantly. If anyone asks why the children also
should die there, I will say that the children cannot go anywhere. In
any case they stay with their parents. Those people are all there in
Kashmir, how can we provide them with arms? A person like me does not
need arms. After all, if we are alive, we have to sacrifice our
lives. Then alone can we say that the soul is immortal. If we do not

the body. But the body has to die one day. If the child is on the

Look at what is happening at Kurukshetra on the one hand, and Kashmir
on the other, and also think of all the hardships that have to be
faced here. So many Muslims have fled to Pakistan. Those who are
running away without any reason may well do so. Who can stop them?
But some of them also go away because they are afraid of us. I feel
ashamed when some Muslim friends come and tell me that they can no
longer stick to their places, for they do not know when they might be
killed. It pains me that fear has taken such roots in their hearts.
Then a woman came and told me that she was feeling scared because a
Pathan was after her. My heart cries out when I hear such things.
Still  I ask, why should there be any fear of a Pathan or anyone else
when one has the support of God? But one can be fearless only when
one knows that one has God with him. When a chaste woman faces a

only the Pathans are rogues; there are rogues to be found everywhere
and they too can be as lustful —she would tremble at the sight of
him. But why should she be scared? You do believe that Sita was never
scared. She was not frightened even when Ravana carried her away on
his shoulder. She went on repeating that her husband was Rama and he
was right beside her. And as Rama was God incarnate, she warned
Ravana that he would be reduced to ashes if he dared to touch her.
She was just a tiny woman but she was pure and because of her purity
she was not afraid. Purity is the most powerful weapon. If we wish to
free ourselves from such a misfortune, we must all follow what is
said in the <i>bhajan</i>. If all the women and men who come to
attend the prayer follow this, this transformation will spread
throughout the country like the fragrance of the rose. Today we have

As that lady doctor has reported, some goondas have entered the
Kurukshetra Camp. Even after getting a blanket, the same person comes
again for a second blanket. Such persons do not realize that all the
people there do not have enough to wear and cover themselves. There
are countless women at Kurukshetra who are still wearing the same
clothes with which they had arrived. I cannot even bear to hear about
these things—who knows what will happen if I have to see these
things? Surely that lady doctor cannot be exaggerating when she
claims to have seen with her own eyes that that is the way things are
going on there.</p>

You must have read in the newspapers, but I also have some
information about what is happening in Kashmir. It should be said
that things are quite all right there now. By that I mean that
Srinagar is still intact.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

possession of the city. Later on it should become all the more
difficult to do so. The plunderers are no fighters. The whole world
is going to look down upon them because they have not gone there by
right. With the passage of time terrorism is diminishing. Things are
in favour of the army which has gone there and it is gaining time. We
cannot send a very large army by air, for it involves a lot of
trouble. But I gather that the Government is being helped in every
way. [Private airlines] are all willingly helping and that is why
troops are easily sent by planes. The planes do not belong to the
Government. The private companies owning the planes have handed them

One thing more—we all praise Subhas Babu’s intelligence and
courage for mobilizing the Azad Hind Fauj. And he does deserve our
praise, for while he was out of the country he felt it would be worth
while to organize an army. He was not a soldier. He was an ordinary
Indian like any lawyer or barrister. He had no military training. He
might have learnt horse-riding as is usual with men in the  Civil
Service. But he must have studied military science later on. Now, I
gather that two officers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  
</font></sup>of the army he had raised, and whom I had met while they
were in prison and outside also, have joined the aggressors in
Kashmir. This hurts me very much. They used to carry out special
assignments under Subhas Babu and used to be always with him. Subhas
Babu could not have kept anything secret from the army personnel
because he had to work through them. It hurts me that those very
persons are now going about as leaders of the freebooters. Through
the newspapers, if they are getting any, or if they care to listen to
me, I would ask them in my failing voice why they should involve
themselves in this affair and bring down Subhas Babu’s name. Why
should they side either with the Hindus or the Muslims? They should
not take a communal stand. That was not</p>

against the Harijans or anyone else. There was no communal
distinction among the Indians in that army. Of course all of them
adhered to their respective religions, none of them had abandoned it.
Subhas Babu had taken possession of their hearts, not of their
bodies. It was not as if those who refused to join the Azad Hind Fauj
were to be slain. He was not going to bring freedom to India by
killing people like this. That is how he became great and earned
fame. Why should these people now stoop so low and get involved in
such mean things? If they really want to do something, let them do
something for the whole of India. Let them restrain the Muslims and
the Afridis from committing atrocities, plundering the people and
burning the villages. Let them persuade them to write to the Maharaja
and Sheikh Abdullah that they want to meet them. They must tell them
that they have not gone there to plunder. If they do so I can
understand their point that they have gone there to show that Islam
is being crushed. Then they would be lending glory to Subhas Babu’s
name and would become true teachers of the Afridis. I do not know how
the Afridis live and if there are any plunderers among them. But in
my view even they are human beings. The same God resides in their
hearts and hence they are my brethren. If I were to live among them I
would ask them why they indulge in loot and plunder and show anger
towards others. I would not ask them to give up their arms. I would
ask them to keep their arms, but in order to protect the people who
are scared, to protect the indigent, the women and children. What
does it matter if they are Hindus or Muslims? I would tell those two
officers, whose names I have already come to know, that they should
remember Subhas Babu. He is dead but not his name and not his work.</p>

Government to act fraudulently in this? I would tell them that
Jawaharlal is not a man who will deceive anyone. He is true to his
name. I also know the Sardar and other men in his Cabinet. They too
are no cheats. If they want to negotiate with [the Maharaja  of]
Kashmir it does not mean that they are trying to misguide him.
Jawaharlal had been having talks with him even earlier and fighting

Pakistan for indulging in their activities. How could they do it
otherwise? If I had been in Pakistan I would have stopped them from

Two Hindu gentlemen have come to me—one from Karachi and the other
from Lahore. The man from Karachi tells me that the situation had
been bad in Karachi but now things are improving day by day. So now,
they asked, would I appeal to the people there not to panic? The
Sindhi Muslims there have lived with the Hindus in amity. They have
quarrelled on many occasions, but have become friends again. I have
been a witness to that. It is not that things have become perfectly
normal there. But the Cabinet wants it to be so. The other gentleman
tells me that all the big mansions in Lahore have been destroyed.
There are not many Hindus left in Lahore—only a handful of them are
there. But the Cabinet desires that the Hindus and Sikhs, all should
live there. Of course, there is some objection about the Sikhs
staying there. Nevertheless, quite a few Sikhs are there. A wonderful
thing I learnt about Lahore is that a Muslim gentleman has kept a
Sikh in his own house. The gentleman who  came to  me narrated what
he had seen with his own eyes. He said that that Muslim had kept an
open copy of the Guru Granthsaheb in one of the rooms of his house
with due respect. He has saved that Sikh because he happens to be his

why should the Muslims in such large numbers be driven away to

They ask why they have been treated thus. They want to know why their

I cannot thank enough those persons who protested in such a courteous
manner against the recitation from the Koran today. This would enable
them to work non-violently. They acted rightly when they expressed
their disapproval of the verses from the Koran. I am glad that they
allowed the prayer to be conducted without any obstruction. In this
way, we are creating divine power for India. It is a gradual process.
It cannot happen as if by magic. But ultimately such a power would be
created. It is my prayer to God that He may grant good sense to the
two senior officers of the Azad Hind Fauj and that the ship of India,
which at the moment is unsteady, may start sailing smoothly in calm

I saw your letter only now, after listening to the sweet and sad
<i>bhaja</i><i>n  </i>containing Draupadi’s prayer<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>:  “O  God,   guard  me  against insult.” I am also
in a similar predicament today. Draupadi  had mighty Bhima and Arjuna
and the truthful Yudhishthira as husbands; she was the
daughter-in-law of men like Dronacharya, Bhishma and Vidura, and yet
amidst an assembly of people it appeared she was in a terrible
plight. At that hour, she did not lose faith and prayed to God from
her heart. And God did protect her honour. This <i>bhajan </i>has a
deep significance. One can go on expatiating on it. Today I also am
seated in a ‘palatial’ house, surrounded by loving friends.
Still, I am in a sad plight. Yet there is God’s help, as I find
each day. Ultimately Delhi will decide the destiny of the whole
country. Our hearts have also become filled with much dirt. I am
striving to remove it. But if I do not succeed I would not wish to
remain a helpless spectator. I have therefore given up my desire to
live for 125 years. May God give good sense to all.</p>

I notice that differences of opinion have cropped up among my
political co-workers, though there are a good many exceptions, I am
speaking of the general situation. Similarly, I understand that in
the Ashram also purity has become a thing of the past. God alone
knows what the real situation is inside the Ashram, since I have been
out of it for the past one year. And yet I continue to live because,
for me, life itself is a great truth. I look upon life as a particle
of God and take care of it as His gift.</p>

	In view of the fact that Dr. Rajendra Prasad has called a meeting of
	the Premiers or their representatives and others to help and advise
	him in the matter of food control, I feel that I should devote this
	evening to that very important question. Nothing that I have heard
	during these days has moved me from the stand I have taken from the
	beginning that the control should be entirely removed at the
	earliest moment possible, certainly not later than six months hence.
	Not a day passes but letters and wires come to me, some from
	important persons, declaring emphatically that both the controls
	should be removed. I propose to omit the other, i. e., cloth control
	for the time being.</p>

	Control gives rise to fraud, suppression of truth, intensification

	them spoon- fed. This is a tragedy next only, if indeed not equal,

rationing in spite of its many drawbacks. Now there need be no export

Today, thank God, the monsoons have not failed us. There is,
therefore, no real scarcity of food. There are enough cereals, pulses
and oil-seeds in the villages of India. The artificial control of
prices, the growers do not, cannot, understand. They, therefore,
refuse willingly to part with their stock at a price much lower than
they command in the open market. This naked fact needs no
demonstration. It does not require statistics or desk-work civilians
buried in their red-tape files to produce elaborate reports and
essays to prove that there is scarcity. It is to be hoped that no one
will frighten us by trotting out before us the bogey of
over-population.</p>

Our ministers are of the people, from the people. Let them not
arrogate to themselves greater knowledge than those experienced men
who do not happen to occupy ministerial chairs—but who hold the
view strongly that the sooner the control is removed the better. A
physician writes to say that the food control has made it impossible
for those who depend upon rationed food to procure eatable cereals
and pulses and therefore, he says, the people needlessly suffer from
ailments caused by rotten stuff.</p>

In the place of controlled food, the Government can easily run the
very stores for selling good grain which they will buy in the open
market. They will thus bring about automatic regulation of prices and
set free the hoarded cereals, pulses and oil-seeds. Will they not
trust the grain dealers and growers? Democracy will break under the
strain of apron strings. It can exist only on trust. If the people
die because they will not labour or because they will defraud one
another, it will be a welcome deliverance. The rest will then learn
not to repeat the sin of being lazy, idle or cruelly selfish.</p>

	has put forth fairly good arguments in the letter. But then it is

The first charge levelled against me is that I have broken a promise.
The letter says: “Have you not said that even if there is a single
individual in your prayer meeting objecting to the recitation from
the Koran, you would respect his wish and cancel the prayer for the
evening?” This is a half-truth which is more dangerous than a total
lie. When I had first cancelled the prayer<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>because there was an objection, I had declared that I
was cancelling the prayer for fear that the large numbers attending
the prayer may start showing their anger against the objector and may
even manhandle him. This was several months ago. Since then people
have learnt the art of restraint. And, when people assured me that
they would not have anger in their hearts nor any ill feeling for the
objector I agreed to hold the public prayer. And, as far as I know,
the result has been good. The behaviour of the persons who object is
extremely courteous and apart from voicing their objection they
create no obstruction in the prayer. Thus, I hope the writer of this
letter will appreciate that I have not gone back on my word. And the
result of continuing the prayer despite the protest has so far been
good. I would like to assure you that as far as I know myself, in
this long life of public service I have never been guilty of breaking
a promise.</p>

The second charge the writer of this letter has made against me is
that while I have the recitation from the Koran and claim that all
religions are equal, I do not have recitations from the  <i>japji</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

come away from West Punjab and other parts of West Pakistan; but
having come to the Indian Union they do not share the trials and
tribulations of other refugees. These leaders have acquired more
spacious buildings than what they had occupied in Pakistan and are
living in great comfort and luxury. These Congress leaders have
completely isolated themselves from the refugees who have no houses
to live in nor woollen clothes to protect themselves against winter.
Many of the refugees do not even have a change of clothes, not to
speak of the woollen clothes. They do not even get good food. If
there is truth in this complaint, it is really shameful. In my prayer
speeches I have denounced those well-to-do refugees who, instead of
sharing the hardships of the poor refugees desert them and live in
luxury. This is not religion but irreligion. The rich must share the
joys and sorrows of their poor brethren.</p>

Then that friend has taunted me that even though I intended going to
Pakistan I have not yet gone. He wants to know why I am in Delhi. He
asks me why I prefer to help my Muslim friends instead of going to
Pakistan and help the Hindus and the Sikhs who are in distress. But
the person who makes such a complaint does not realize that I cannot
disregard my duty here in Delhi and go to Pakistan in the hope of
helping the Hindus and the Sikhs there. I admit that I am a friend of
the Muslims and others because I am equally a friend of the Hindus
and the Sikhs. when I serve anyone, it is because I am inspired by
the thought that he is a part not only of India or one particular
religion but of the whole of humanity. The Hindu and Sikh refugees
and others here have to prove by being friendly with the Muslims here
that I need not stay on in Delhi any longer. Then I would rush to
Pakistan with full confidence that my going there would not be in
vain.</p>

The person who has made these complaints has not spared even the
Kasturba Fund. He asks how the Kasturba Fund is being utilized and
why it could not be utilized for giving relief to the refugees. The
first thing is that the Fund was raised for a particular purpose when
I was in jail.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>In

The last complaint of the writer is that when Pakistan has put a ban
on the slaughter of pigs why cannot India prohibit cow-slaughter? I
am not aware about a legal ban on the slaughter of pigs in Pakistan.
If the information given by this friend is correct, I am sorry about
it. I know that Islam forbids the eating of pork. But even so, I do
not think it is proper to stop the non-Muslims from eating pork.</p>

Has not the Qaid-e-Azam proclaimed that Pakistan is not a theocratic
State and religion would not be imposed by law? But, unfortu-nately,
it is true that this claim is not always put into practice. Would
India become a theocratic State and would the principles of Hinduism
be imposed on non-Hindus? I hope not. If that happens India would
cease to be land of hope and promise. Then it would not be a country
to which not only all the races of Asia and Africa but the whole
world would look with hope. The world does not expect from Hindustan
whether as Indian Union or Pakistan meanness and fanaticism. It
expects greatness, goodness and generosity from Hindustan so that the
whole world can learn a lesson and find light in the midst of the
prevailing darkness.</p>

I do not lag behind anyone in my devotion to and worship of the cow.
But such feeling of worship and belief cannot be imposed on anybody
by law. It can be created by increasing friendly relations and proper
behaviour with the Muslims and all other non-Hindus. The Gujaratis
and the Marwaris are supposed to be leading all others in the matter
of protecting the cow. But they have forgotten the principles of
Hinduism to such an extent that they would gladly impose restrictions
on others while they may themselves illtreat the cow and her progeny.
Why are the cattle of India the most neglected lot in the whole
world?</p>

The pinjarapoles of India are not such that one can be proud of. A
lot of money is spent on them but the cattle are hardly tended
scientifically or intelligently. These pinjarapoles cannot give a new
lease of life to India’s cattle. This can be done only by treating
the cattle with sympathy and kindness. I claim that more than any
other Hindu, I have saved a larger number of cows from the butcher’s
knife without the assistance of law, because of my being able to
cultivate friendship with the Muslims.</p>

	Because we have oppressed them so far, if anyone talks to them with

You may not have heard about a place called Pandharpur. It is a place
for pilgrimage in Maharashtra. There are innumerable legends about
the idols in that place, but I do not want to narrate them to you.
The temple at Pandharpur was not open  to  Harijans.  Sane  Guruji<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>installed himself there and argued with the Trustees
that when all other temples were thrown open to Harijans, there was
no reason why the Pandharpur temple should not be opened to them.
When his request was not granted he went on fast<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>. Sane Guruji is a great devotee, and how could the
trustees therefore allow him to die? Sense dawned on them and they
were moved to pity. But they told him they were helpless in the face
of a number of technical difficulties, which had to be first removed.
Then Mavalankar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3   </font></sup>joined
him there and Sane Guruji was persuaded to  give  up  his  fast<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4
</font></sup>.  But  he  ended  his  fast  on  the condition that he
would resume the fast if the temple was not opened to Harijans. Now I
have received a telegram that the necessary Bill has been passed and
that the temple has been opened to Harijans. The temple was willingly
opened and people thronged there in thousands. There were no
protests. There may have been some stray protests among those
thousands. So, after all, that great temple of Pandharpur had to be
opened to Harijans after so much effort. If all those excesses we
have been perpetrating on the Harijans become a thing of the past the
country would rise very high. But right now we are following a
downward path because we are possessed by feelings of animosity. But
it is my hope that India will not be forever possessed by such
madness. The rest God alone knows.</p>

I have been asked a few questions. Actually, these questions have
been asked in separate letters but I have grouped them together. The
first question is asked by a Muslim friend. As I said yesterday,
nobody can be compelled to give up eating beef. We can only request
him and convince him. The person concerned may be convinced and he
may give it up. It would indeed be wonderful if he would give it up
out of love. But there are a large number of Hindus who eat meat, it
may be fish or some other meat. There are very few Hindus who do</p>

them to give up eating meat and it they do not comply tell them that
they should leave India, otherwise you would kill them? If this
cannot be done, what wrong have the Muslims done? Why should they be
compelled? I know there are some fanatical Hindus who are compelling
them. I would call this an atrocity from which we should keep away.</p>

The next question is raised by a Hindu friend. He writes to say that
it is indeed true that all Hindus do not have in them the feeling of
animosity. But he refers to my advice to the Muslims that they should
not leave their houses, and, if needs be, die. He says that in spite
of this wise talk of mine, wisdom does not dawn on the people. On the
one hand, he says, I go on with my wise talk, and on the other hand
the Muslims are harassed to such an extent that they cannot even come
out of their houses. They are being threatened with death if they
refuse to go away. If the Muslims come out of their own localities
they are being killed. But how can they earn their living if they do
not come out? Many of them are craftsmen and labourers. Take for
instance a weaver. If the Hindus decide not to use the cloth woven by
him and threaten to kill any Hindu insisting on using his cloth, then
there is no point in allowing him to stay here. How can a labourer
confine himself to his own locality? He would then be worse than a
slave. In a poor locality how can he maintain his family if he cannot
come out? No well-to-do Muslim stays in such poor localities and how
can the poor people staying there maintain themselves if they cannot
go out? It is absurd if on the one hand we harass them to such an
extent and on the other people like me ask them to die.</p>

We boast that everything is under control in Delhi and no big
incidents take place. But I would say that even if there is a little
trouble, it should hurt us. I would go on repeating that if such
things continue to happen in India, with what face can we tell the
Muslims that they should stay in India? If all the Muslims go away to
Pakistan and all the Hindus and Sikhs come to India, then we would
become permanent enemies. And then we would be fighting to our
hearts’ content. Let us save ourselves from such an absurd
situation.</p>

who has asked, it is a question all right. It is worth asking and
also not worth asking. The question is: “You advised even the
British to follow the path of non-violence when they were facing
defeat. You advised them to give up arms and become non-violent. You
could show that much courage there; then why don’t you ask the
Government of the country to fight a non-violent battle?” I have
already stated that I am a nobody and no one listens to me. People
say that the Sardar is my man and Panditji also is but mine and
Maulana too is my man. They are all mine and also not mine. I have
never abandoned my non- violence. I have been training myself in
non-violence and it was acceptable till we attained independence. Now
they wonder how they can rule with non-violence. And then there is
the army and they have taken the help of the army. Now I am of no
value at all. But why am I still with the people when I have lost my
value? It is in the hope that they may perhaps listen to me. At least
a few persons like you do come and quietly join me in the prayer.
Others may follow your example and ultimately wisdom may dawn on
everybody. Maybe my words will have some effect. It is only with that
hope that I am continuing to be here and doing all these things. I do
not know how long God wants me to work. He can stop me working this
very day if He so wishes. I would die right here if He takes away my
breath. Hence, I still stand by what  I  had  conveyed  to  Hitler,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

 say  the  same  thing  to  our Government. But in Kashmir Sheikh
Abdullah is giving a brave fight—I have always admired bravery. It
is true that he believes in violence but it requires courage and I do
admire it. I admire even Subhas Babu not because I approved of his
violence but because I could have never formed the Azad Hind Fauj.
When I see something good and fail to give it due credit, I cannot be
truly non-violent. I have no doubt that if Sheikh Abdullah fights it
to the last and keeps the Hindus and the Sikhs with him, it is bound
to have a great impact on the people here. However, if I could have
my way of non-violence and everybody listened to me, we would not
send our army as we are doing now. And if we did send, it would be a
non-violent army. It</p>

doing now. And if we did send, it would be a non-violent army. It
would be a non-violent fight if our people went there and gladly met
their death at the hands of the Afridis. It would be a non-violent
war because they would be dying remaining non-violent. Sheikh
Abdullah too would tell the Afridis that they could take Srinagar but
only when all the fighters were dead. But they are all fighting with
arms and fighting bravely. They too can become non-violent—though
it would not be the true form of non-violence. Supposing an army of a
lakh of armed Afridis invaded the place and a handful of people
offered armed resistance in order to protect the innocent children
and women and died fighting, then they could be called no-violent in
spite of their using arms. But to whom can I say this? Today poison
has spread on all sides and people kill each other in a barbarous
manner. In this situation even I am not able to teach this simple
lesson in  non- violence. In his time Mr. Churchill could not say,
but today, Sheikh Abdullah and the army which has gone there can tell
me that my non- violence has failed in Delhi where acts of barbarism
are being committed and what they are doing is not barbaric. And I
must admit that they have a right to say that. But they cannot tell
me anything if I can convince all the Hindus, Muslims and the Sikhs
of the Union about my non-violence. In that event, I could myself go
with a non- violent army to Kashmir or Pakistan or any place, and
then my work would become very easy. And then, the impact of
non-violence would be so great that it would be worth seeing. But
when can I hope for such an occasion? If you listen to my words and
act in accordance with them, if my words have greater power and my
heart greater strength, if my penance, however great it may be
becomes still greater and every word of mine becomes so powerful that
it grips the whole of India, my task will be accomplished. But today
I am helpless. If you also pray to God that He may put strength into
my words and take me further than where He has taken me and get still
more work out of my body, then India may have greater impact on the
world.</p>

What they say may prove true and that the senseless bloodbath through
which India is still passing, though the original fury seems to have
abated, may be nothing unusual as history goes. What India is passing
through must be regarded as unusual. If we grant that such liberty as
India has gained was a tribute to non-violence as I have repeatedly
said, non-violence of India’s struggle was only in name, in reality
it was passive resistance of the weak. The truth of the statement we
see demonstrated by the happenings in India.</p>

A correspondent draws attention to the fact that whereas I have
condemned the use at railway stations of different pots of water for
Muslims   and   Hindus,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2    
 </font></sup>now   there   are   compartments   reserved   for
Muslims only and non-Muslims or Hindus. I do not know how far the
evil has spread, but I do know that this distinction is a matter of
great shame for the Hindus and the Sikhs. I suppose it became
necessary for the railway administration to make the distinction for
the simple protection of Muslim life. It is any day possible (the
sooner the better) to stop the practice, by the Hindus and the Sikhs
making up their minds never to dispose of Muslim fellow-passengers,
as if they were chattels and to assure the railway administration
that the offence will never be repeated. This can happen when there
is an open confession of sin and return to sanity. This I say,
irrespective of what has happened or may still happen in Pakistan.</p>

Now the times have changed. Nobody will ask you to export food. We
have enough stock with us and still if we import foodgrain, crores of
rupees will go out of the country. Where is the money for that? You
may call mine a voice in the wilderness, if you wish to. My stay in
Delhi has had no effect. [Hindus and Muslims] still have ill feeling
towards each other. Maulana Saheb who was till now our President and
who is now a minister cannot go amongst the Hindus. If he takes
courage in both hands and tries to do so, he will be killed. The good
Muslims cannot live in peace and that is why I can do nothing for the
Hindus in Pakistan. I am deliberately speaking about this unfortunate

I did not know that the business magnates would agree with me in
this. You should carry out the wishes of the people in an efficient
manner. If I were to become a minister I would have to ascertain the
views of everyone. What a pity that rice which used to cost Rs. 2 now
costs Rs. 40. The farmers have foodgrain with them. If the control is
removed they will automatically bring it out. I am myself a farmer. I
have seen that farmers who grow foodgrain do not use their own
produce for consumption. They have to eat the rotten stuff sent from
the city. What sort of transaction is this? I did not know that Dr.

This year we have had good rainfall. Now there is no foreigner here

foodgrain here. If you teach them how to grow food the stock would

Let me now come to control on cloth. Even though I am more certain
about removing control on cloth than control on food, I am afraid I
do not have as much support in the removal of cloth-control as in the
removal of food-control. The Congress had gladly supported my view
that khadi could take the place of the mill-cloth, whether Indian or
foreign. It had set up a Khadi Board under the late Jamnalalji<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
      </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>which
  was   expanded    into    the    All-India    Spinners’
Association after my release from the Yeravda Prison. India has a
population of 400 million. Even after discounting the portion of the
population of Pakistan, India would still have more than 300 million.
India grows enough cotton for the entire population. There are
sufficient number of persons to spin that cotton into yarn. And,
there are more than sufficient number of weavers to weave cloth out
of that yarn. Without a large investment we can easily manufacture in
the country spinning-wheels, looms and other accessories that we
need. All that we need is robust faith in ourselves and a
determination to wear no other cloth but khadi. You know that we can
make khadi of the fine quality with designs that would be far
superior to those of the mills. Now that India is free from the
foreign yoke, there will no longer be opposition to khadi which was
characteristic of the representatives of foreign rulers. That is why
I am surprised all the more that even when we are completely free to
do what we want, we neither talk about khadi nor have faith in the
potentialities of khadi. And, we think of nothing but mill-cloth to
meet India’s needs in this respect. I have not the slightest doubt
that khadi economics can be the only true and sound economics for
India.</p>

Peace in Asia depends on India and China. These two countries are
large. And if they build their edifices on the foundation of ahimsa
they will become known among the great countries of the world. When I

I fear, like many experts, General Cariappa has gone beyond his depth
and has been unwittingly betrayed into a serious misconception of
ahimsa, of whose working in the nature of things, he can only have  a
very superficial knowledge. By reason of lifelong practice of ahimsa,
I claim to be an expert in it, though very imperfect. Speaking in
absolute terms, the more I practise it the clearer I see how far I am
from the full expression of ahimsa in my life. It is his ignorance of
this, the greatest duty of man in the world, which makes him say that
in this age non-violence has little scope in the face  of violence,
whereas I make bold to say that in this age of the atom bomb,
unadulterated non-violence is the only force that can confound all
the tricks put together of violence. It would have become the
General, unaided as he can only now be, by his British teachers of
military science and practice not to have gone out of his depth.
Generals greater than General Cariappa have been wise and humble
enough frankly to make the admission that they can have no right to
speak of the possibilities of the force of ahimsa. We are witnessing
the tragic insolvency of military science and practice in its own
home. Should a bankrupt, who has been by the gamble in the
share-market, sing the praise of that particular form of gambling?</p>

I am told that the refugees have become a problem in Delhi and that
because they have suffered atrocities in Pakistan, they think they
have special privileges. When they go to buy things in the market
they expect the shopkeeper to give them what they want without
charging them anything or at a considerably reduced rate. At times, a
single person buys things worth hundreds of rupees. Some refugees
expect the tongawallahs to give them free rides or charge a very
nominal fare. If this report is true, it is my duty to say that the
refugees have failed to learn the lesson that sufferers generally
learn through hardships. Thereby they are harming themselves and the
country and making the already complicated problem more complicated.
If they continue to behave like this, they are sure to lose the
sympathy of the Delhi traders.</p>

At the same time, I cannot understand how the refugees who have come
from Pakistan after losing everything, can  buy  things worth
hundreds of rupees. I would also wish that except on rare and
necessary occasions, the refugees should not use anything other than
their God given feet for moving about. Apart from this, I am also
told that ever since lakhs of refugees started coming to Delhi, there
has been a steep rise in the revenue derived from spirituous liquor.
As a matter of fact, those people should realize that when the
Central and the Provincial Governments accede to the demands of the
Congress, neither hard liquor nor other intoxicants like opium and
hemp would be available in the Indian Union. The same situation can
be created in Pakistan too, because our Muslim friends would not need
a Congress resolution to declare total prohibition. Can the refugees,
who have undergone so many hardships, not restrain themselves from
taking intoxicants and indulging in luxuries? I hope the refugee men
and women will take the advice I have given them through my earlier
speeches that wherever they go, the refugees should mix with the
people like sugar in milk, and make a firm resolve not to be a burden
on them. Let the rich and the poor refugees live in the same camps
and work in full co-operation, so that they can become ideal and
self- supporting citizens.</p>

have become ineffective. You see what even men like General Cariappa

to achieve the state of a <i>sthitaprajna</i>, that is to say, mental
equipoise. I have made considerable progress in this direction and
have already arrived at the conclusion that Ramanama is the cure for
all ailments and it is my hope that when I die I shall die with
Ramanama in my heart. This faith becomes stronger in me each day. You
see there was a time when even my opponents took my guidance. Today,
let alone my being assailed by my opponents, even my co-workers,
friends and close relatives who are like sons to me, do not see eye
to eye with me. Still, I am mentally in such excellent health that it
surprises me that with the flames raging around me I remain untouched
by their heat or sparks. The reason for this is that God is filling
me with strength and I am sustained by Ramanama. Just as men derive
vigour and vitality from the daily nourishment and sleep I derive my
strength from Rama.</p>

I have no doubt that when the bales of cotton arrive I will be able
to persuade the mill-owners to supply enough chintz for quilts. The
talk about bales of cotton reminds me of cloth-control. In my
opinion, it is possible and also easy for the people of India to
manufacture enough khadi by hand. The only condition is that
sufficient cotton should be available in the country. I do not know
if there ever was a famine of cotton in the country. We can never
have scarcity of cotton, because we always produce more cotton than
the country needs. Tens of thousands of bales of cotton are being
exported from the country. Still, there is never a shortage of cotton
for the textile mills of the country. I have already drawn  your
attention to the fact that it is possible to have within the country
all the implements necessary for carding, spinning and weaving by
hand. At the same time, there are also people in large numbers
wanting to work. Hence, I can only say that it is nothing but inertia
which makes people think that there is scarcity of cloth in the
country. Today nobody in the country wants cloth-control—neither
the mills, nor the mill-hands nor the buying public. Controls are
increasing the  band  of lazy people and thus ruining the country.
Such people, for want of any work, are a constant source of mischief.</p>

If the refugees are determined to occupy themselves in useful work,
they would first make their own quilts, and then all—women and
men—would spend their time in ginning, carding, spinning, weaving,
etc. The energy generated by the co-operative effort of so many lakhs
of refugees would electrify the country. They would inspire the
people to spend all their spare time in growing more food and
producing khadi in their own homes. Let it be remembered that if the
cotton, instead of being packed into bales, is directly made
available to the spinners one process would be saved. The cotton
would not be damaged, carding would become easy and the seeds would
be saved for the villages.</p>

sick and distressed people and tries to console them as much as she
can. When she paid a visit to the Kurukshetra camp, people asked her
when I was expected to go there. All of them were so keen to see me
that Lady Mountbatten was convinced that I should undoubtedly go
there. I assured her that she was justified in anticipating my visit.
To tell you the truth, I have made arrangements to visit Panipat,
where both the Hindus and the Muslims are anxious to see me. I had
decided to combine the visits to Kurukshetra and Panipat. But now I
have come to know that I cannot combine the two. Hence, it has become
necessary to postpone my visit to Kurukshetra until after the
forthcoming meeting of the A. I. C. C.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>Nonetheless, it has been suggested that even though it
is difficult to arrange for loudspeakers in a sprawling camp like
Kurukshetra, it should not be difficult to talk to them over the
radio, provided the necessary speakers are installed in the camp. If
such an arrangement is made, I would be able to speak to them on
Tuesday or Wednesdayand would go and see them later. In the mean
time, I hope to complete my visit to the Panipat camp.</p>

I shall certainly make inquiries. Pantji<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>has promised that  the Government would make every
effort to protect each and every Muslim in the U.P. But shall I
venture a suggestion? If you desire complete protection for Muslims
and wish to serve your brethren, you should show sympathy towards the
Hindus who have come from Pakistan. You should serve them in their
camps and convince them that you are their brothers. I must say that
I have not yet come across  a single Muslim who would do this. We
shall discuss this matter at leisure some other time.</p>

We will be saved a lot of botheration if we cease to think of how we
appear to others and concentrate on what is beneficial to us.
Knowingly or unknowingly, we resort to many artificial aids to please
or appear good to others. As a result, we become miserable. The same
thing applies to this hat.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

I care for appearances, I will have to face the sun and damage my
health for no reason. Do you understand this? Well, I have taught you
a good lesson after many days. If we analyse it minutely, our
barbaric behaviour and  Hindu-Muslim tension are also due to our
preoccupation with how we appear to others. A man’s thoughts play a
major role in his life. That is why, as you also know, the proverb
says: “As one’s food, so one’s belching; as one’s thoughts,
so one’s deeds.       ”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup></p>

facts. My advice to  abstain  from  the  rejoicings<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>is  broadbased  on many solid considerations. The
refugee problem is there, affecting lakhs of Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs. There is as well want (albeit man- made) of food and clothing.
The deeper cause is dishonesty of the many who can mould public
opinion, obstinate refusal of sufferers to learn from their
sufferings and extensive inhumanity of man to man. I can see in this
misery no cause for joy. A resolute and wise refusal to take part in
festivities will be an incentive to introspection and self-
purification. Let us not do anything which will throw away a blessing

I must now refer to a visit of friends from French India<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>during the week. They complained that what I had said
regarding what was claimed   to   be   a   satyagraha   in  
Chandranagore,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3      </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was   misused   to suppress the aspirations of the
people in French India for the fullest measure of autonomy under the
Indian Union, whilst retaining at the same time, the wholesome
influence of French culture. They also told me that, as under the
British Government, there were, in French India, those who might be
likened to fifth-columnists, who, in order to serve their selfish
purpose, co-operated with the French authorities who, in their turn,
were aiming at suppressing the natural aspirations of the inhabitants
of French India. I would be very sorry indeed if  the account given
by the visitors from French India were accurate. Anyway, my opinion
is quite emphatic. It is not possible for the inhabitants   of  
these   small   foreign   settlements<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4
     </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
  remain   under servility in the face of the millions of their
countrymen who have become free from the British rule. I am surprised
that my friendly act towards Chandranagore could be distorted by
anyone to suggest that I could ever countenance an inferior status in
the little foreign settlements in India. I hope, therefore, that the
information given to me has no foundation in fact, and that the great
French nation would never identify itself with the suppression of
people, whether black or brown, in India or elsewhere.</p>

While each province develops and its  regional  language becomes the
medium of instruction, each province will still remain an indivisible
part of India. Since there will be crores of students to derive the
benefit of education and as they look upon the whole of India as
their motherland, they will need a language commonly understood by
students from all provinces. In addition to the regional language,
there will be the need for a language which has wide currency. Hindi
or Hindustani alone can play this role. Hence all students should
learn it in both the scripts as a compulsory second- language.</p>

towards peace. Both  the  Dominions  would develop friendly relations
and would work in mutual co- operation. I do not think about the
Qaid-e-Azam as the Governor- General. As the Governor-General the
Qaid-e-Azam has no legal right at all to interfere in the affairs of
Pakistan. In that capacity he is in the same position as that of Lord
Mountbatten in India who is only the constitutional Governor-General.
Lord Mountbatten has gone for the wedding of a person who is more
than a son to him and who is getting married to the future queen of
England. He could go there only after taking permission from his
Cabinet and would be coming back by November 24, 1947. Hence in my
opinion Jinnah is the maker of the present Muslim League and nothing
can be done in Pakistan without his knowledge and sanction. That is
why I feel that if Jinnah has a hand in Junagadh’s accession to the
Indian Union, it is a happy augury.</p>

than 20,000 refugees are reported to be in Panipat. We were told
every day more and more refugees are pouring in. The Deputy
Commissioner and the Police Superintendent see great danger in this
trend. I am glad to say that these officers have earned great praise
from the Hindus as well as the Muslims. And, as for the refugees,

Municipal House. The refugees had to undergo terrible hardships in
Pakistan and are still suffering the same hardships in the
disorganized life at Panipat. Some of them are living on railway
platforms, and quite a few of them in the open, right under the sky.
Nevertheless, I was very happy to notice that there was no anger in
their hearts or on their faces. They were very happy that we had been
there. I felt the authorities had been quite callous in collecting so
many refugees in Panipat without giving advance notice to the Deputy
Commissioner and the people concerned. The officials at Panipat came
to know about the exact number of refugees only when the trains
arrived at the station. This is most unfortunate. There are women,
children and aged people among the refugees at Panipat. I was told

All this is happening in East Punjab where Dr. Gopichand<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

the Chief Minister. Dr. Gopichand is my co-worker. I have great

considerable work for the Harijan Sevak Sangh, the All-India 
Spinners’s Association and the All-India Village Industries

beyond him. But, if Panipat is the sample of his efficiency, it is a
matter of great shame for his Government. Why were so many refugees
brought to Panipat without any notice? Why are the arrangements for
accommodating them so inadequate? Why should not the officers be
informed in advance as to who and how many refugees are being sent to
Panipat? Along with this I have also received the information
yesterday that there are about three lakh Muslims in Gurgaon district
who have left their houses in panic. They are lying in the open on
both sides of the road hoping to cover a distance of 300 miles along
with their women, children and cattle in this biting cold of the
Punjab. I do not believe this story. I think there is some mistake in
what my friends have told me. I still hope that this information is
incorrect or is a gross exaggeration. But what I saw at Panipat has
shaken my dis-belief in such reports. None the less, I hope that Dr.
Gopichand is Cabinet would take a warning while there is still time
and would not rest till proper arrangements are made for looking
after the refugees. Such arrangements can be made only be foresight
and extreme caution.</p>

No one who wants to start a worthy enterprise should ever wish to
have anybody’s blessings, not even of the highest in the land. A
worthy enterprise carries its own blessing. On the other hand, if an
unworthy project receives any blessing from outside, it becomes, as
it should become, a curse. Indeed, I have come to the conclusion that
a blessing from outside interferes with the even progress of one’s
enterprise, because it very often induces a false hope and turns one
away from the industry and watchfulness required for the success of a
cause.</p>

this surmise is true, it suggests that the suspicion and hatred of
one community towards another is not so deep as now appears. It also
means that as soon as the masses can be guided back into their
ancient ways of life with the chief emphasis on religion and small
organizations—village panchayats and communal family systems—the
energy of the people will be turned from violence into creative

Though many psychologists have recommended a study of psychology, I
am sorry I have not been able, for want of time, to study the
subject. Mr. Gregg’s letter does not mend matters for me. It does
not fill me with any impelling enthusiasm for undertaking the study.
Mr. Gregg gives an explanation which mystifies the mind instead of
clearing it. “Hope for the future” I have never lost and never
will, because it is embedded in my undying faith in non-violence.
What has, however, clearly happened in my case is the discovery that

non-violence. There was no real appreciation of non-violence in the
thirty years’ struggle against British Raj. Therefore, the peace
the masses maintained during that struggle of a generation with
exemplary patience, had not come from within. The pent-up fury found
an outlet when British Raj was gone. It naturally vented itself in
communal violence which was never fully absent and which was kept
under suppression by the British bayonet. This explanation seems to
me to be all-sufficing and convincing. In it there is no room for
failure of any hope. Failure of my technique of non-violence causes
no loss of faith in non-violence itself. On the contrary, that faith
is, if possible, strengthened by the discovery of a possible flaw in
the technique.</p>

By the way, has vegetarianism a real foothold in America or is it
merely a fad of cranks like you and me? Have the dietetic reformers
found anything which can be described as a complete substitute for

come to the conclusion that some form of animal fat and animal

You have yourself written ‘Radhabehn’ instead of mere ‘Radha’.
According to Indian custom, between friends ‘Radha behn’ is mere
‘Radha’. The omission of the suffix <i>behn, </i>meaning sister,
is a mark of great endearment and intimacy. If you were writing to a
casual acquaintance or an utter stranger, then you will naturally
mention ‘Radha’ by her full name ‘Radhabehn’. Therefore, I
dare not call you ‘Govindbhai’ and ‘Radha’  as ‘Radhabehn’.
<i>Bhai </i>meansbrother,but when <i>behn </i>and <i>bhai </i>are
used as suffixes to a name, they have merely an honorific value.</p>

What you say is true. But you should have so much love in your heart
that the children themselves would have the urge to finish their
household work early and run to you. The attraction should be so
intense that the parents will ultimately allow their children to go
to you, realizing that the children are actually growing wiser. From
your very long letter and the fact that you notice no change in the
narrow-mindedness of the villagers even after two years, I feel that
you yourself are to blame in some way. One should be able to discover
one’s own shortcomings. Moreover, I am of the view that it will be
easier for you to work amongst the less intelligent villagers as you
call them, than with the so-called polite and intelligent people of
the cities.  Do give serious thought to this letter.  If it is

I told you yesterday that the Provisional Government had entered the
State of Junagadh at the request of its Prime Minister<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Deputy Prime Minister<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

because I had not expected that the struggle which was being carried
on behalf of the people of Junagadh would have such a happy ending.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

</font></sup>, it would not be proper to feel happy about it right
now. Hence, you would be amazed and distressed to know that the
officials of Pakistan have protested against the Provisional
Government assuming power on behalf of the people of Junagadh. They
have demanded “withdrawal of Indian troops from the State territory
and relinquishment of the administration to the rightful Government
and stoppage of violence and invasion of the State by people from the
Indian Union”. They also say that neither the Nawab nor the Dewan
of Junagadh has any legal authority to negotiate permanent or
provisional settlement with the Indian Union. According to Pakistan
the  action  of  the Government of India is “a clear violation of
the Pakistan territory and  a breach of international law”.</p>

State. As far as I can see, there is nothing illegal in the campaign
carried on by the Provisional Government on behalf of the people of
Junagadh. It is true that the Union Government sent military help for
the safety of the whole of Kathiawar at the request of the rulers of
Kathiawar. For that reason, I find nothing illegal in this whole
action. As against this; whatever the Dewan of Junagadh did by
publicly changing his stand was illegal. I look at the whole
situation like this— the Nawab of Junagadh had no right at all to
accede to Pakistan without the consent of his people, of which I am
told 85% are Hindus.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The sacred hill of Girnar and all the temples on it are
part of Junagadh. The Hindus have spent a lot of money on those
temples and thousands of pilgrims go to the Girnar on pilgrimage from
all parts of India. In free India, the whole country belongs to the
people. Not even the smallest portion of it is the private property
of the Princes. They can retain their claim only by becoming trustees
of the people and that is why they would be required to give evidence
of popular support for every action of theirs. True, the Princes have
not yet realized that they are the trustees and representatives of
the people. And it is also true that with the exception of the alert
subjects of some States, the people of all States have not yet
realized themselves as the true rulers of their States. But that does
not diminish the value of the principle I have laid down.</p>

Hence, only the people of a particular State have a legal right to
accede to one of the Unions. If the Provisional Government does not
represent the people of Junagadh at any stage, it is merely a group
of people who are unjustly occupying seats of power in the State and
it should be driven out by both the Dominions. If any ruler joins any
of the Unions in his personal capacity, the Dominion cannot stand
before the world to justify his action. From this point of view, I
think that the Nawab’s accession has been baseless from the very
beginning till it is proved that the people of the State have given
their consent to the accession by the Nawab. The dispute as to which
Union Junagadh would finally accede to can be resolved only by taking
 public  opinion, that is, by referendum. This task should be
properly carried</p>

out and should not involve violence or show of violence. The stand
taken by the Government of Pakistan and now also by the Prime
Minister of Junagadh, has created a strange situation. Who was to
decide whether Pakistan was in the right or the Union Government? One
cannot even think that it can be decided by an appeal to the sword.
The only honourable way is to decide the matter through arbitration.
We can find many impartial individuals in the country itself but, if
the parties concerned cannot agree to arbitration by Indians, I for
one will have no objection to any impartial person from any part of

	I  am  dictating  this   letter   to   you   at   4   in   the  
	morning. Dr. Dinshaw and Jehangir Patel are at present with me. We
	sat together and came to the conclusion that Dr. Dinshaw should earn
	as much as he needs for his maintenance by charging fees for the
	nature-cure treatment he offers outside the Trust<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
	 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>formed
	in Poona. There was a time when we had thought of paying Dr. Dinshaw
	his maintenance allowance out of the Trust funds. But it was
	somethingDr. Dinshaw could not bring himself to accept. Then it was
	thought that he should engage himself in some other occupation and
	earn enough for his maintenance. That also is not possible at
	present. He should therefore accept fees from the townspeople,
	offering them treatment in his own style and practise nature cure as
	he conceives it. He should do it either by expanding his own clinic
	which he runs in Bombay or with the assistance of the hospital unit
	at Purandar. From a broader point of view, between the two I would
	prefer Bombay to Purandar. Neither institution has a place for
	nature cure as I conceive it. It can be practised only with village
	background and nowhere but in a village. At the root of it lies the
	great question of changing individual life as well as social life.
	This Trust therefore must maintain its separate identity. If the
	treatment is meant for the townspeople it must have</p>

Government’s aid, without which nowadays no accommodation can be  
had.   In   Bombay   extra   floors    will   be    required    where
Dr. Dinshaw carries on his practice, or he will have to have another
building to meet his requirements. The point is that you should offer
Dr. Dinshaw the necessary accommodation in Purandar through a
non-government source at a reasonable rent or cost without bestowing
any special favour on him. The main consideration here could be
nothing but service to the public. The rich can get nature-cure
treatment also by paying for it. We can expect such accommodation for
a person whom the Government regards as suitable. This letter will
not be out of place if only the Government of Bombay could think
about it from this point of view.</p>

I had your letter. Your complaint about this letter  of  Dr. Dinshaw
should be regarded as directed against me. If you have been at all
humiliated it is my fault, although it could never have been my
intention, for the language in Dr. Dinshaw’s letter is mine. Won’t
you please now forget the matter? Dr. Dinshaw and Jehangir Patel have
been here for the last four-five days. I had long discussions with
them. On the basis of that I am of opinion that if you wish to reject
the Trust Deed you can do so now, you can also remove the Sanatorium.
It will not involve any legal procedure or even arbitration. You may,
if you want, make some addition to the present list of Dr. Dinshaw or
have a talk with him. I can only say that if you want the Trust to
stay you should donate to the Trust the land which I was occupying
and where the patients were being treated. This should also include
the rear portion which was being used for the labourers. The place is
not to be used for producing anything but only to be developed in
case we have to accommodate a few people there for the sake of some
patients. The rest of the land should be returned to you. Then it
cannot have the Sanatorium either. It means that apart from the land
and building I have asked for, you will use the portion which you are
now occupying and which is included in the schedule. When I am free
myself from the work here, the other trustees and I can live on  the 
premises  donated to the Trust. Dinshaw, his wife, mother and such 
other relatives as can be accommodated on the premises can live
there; the Trust has recognized their right to reside on the
premises. Jehangir says you have another complaint that Dr Dinshaw
does not at all intend to let me be your guest. This is not correct.
If my suggestion is accepted, even if I stay in the house donated by
you, I shall still be your guest because, if you wish, arrangements
for goat’s milk, etc., will be made by you. Goats, etc., cannot be
kept on the premises I expect from you. I may say one more thing,
namely, that you are going to lose nothing by your donation to the
Trust. Dr. Dinshaw has invested more than a lakh in your property. He
has also spent a substantial sum on the construction of bathrooms and
a steamhouse,</p>

etc., on the premises I am asking for. If you take all the land these
expensive additions will be of no use to you. Now you may  do
whatever you think proper. You can have a further talk in this
connection with Dr. Dinshaw and Jehangir.</p>

Truly speaking, there should not be too many student organizations.
There should be one students’ body, and differences of caste and
creed should have no place in it. In the present critical situation
the Muslim students and youths, if they make up their minds, can
render great service. You should say, ‘We are of course Muslims.
You may not trust us. Still we entreat you to trust us for the moment
and accept our services.’ If your hearts are pure and if you would
serve India, there can be no better service than this at the present
juncture.</p>

The General told me of all that still needed to be done in

It seems as if there was no proper screening of refugees and it is
hard to understand why they come and are dumped in various places
without proper intimation to the local authority. In my post-prayer

illumination but what we need today is the light of love in our
hearts. We must kindle the light of love within. Then only would we
deserve congratulations. Today thousands are in acute distress. Can
you, everyone of you, lay your hand on your heart and say that every
sufferer, whether Hindu, Sikh or Muslim, is your own brother  or

life seems all right to me. But from the point of view of nature cure
the three are indivisible. When you develop nature cure to its
highest potential, it will include village uplift work also. And I
cannot  conceive of nature cure for village people which does not
imply the Ashram ideal of life. If you start cultivation work through
the institution itself and with the help of paid labourers, I think
you will have to repent it in the end. But notwithstanding this view

There is a big gulf between ‘seeing God face to face’ and ‘seeing
Him in the embodiment of Truth from a far distance’. In my opinion
the two statements are not only not incompatible but each explains
the other. We see the Himalayas from a very great distance and when
we are on the top we have seen the Himalayas face to face. Millions
can see them from hundreds of miles away if they are within the range
of that seeing distance, but few having arrived at the top after
years of travel see them face to face. This does not seem to need
elucidation in the columns of the <i>Harijan. </i>Nevertheless, I
send your letter and my reply for publication in the <i>Harijan, </i>lest
there may be some like you who think that there is any inconsistency
between the two statements quoted by you.</p>

What shall I write about language? My view is clear, namely, the
national language should be such as can be spoken by millions of our
countrymen. But we behave, knowingly or unknowingly, as if it was our
birthright to oppose and contest every issue. As a result, we are
able to achieve nothing. Though I do like to face such difficulties
and am able to overcome them also, have you ever considered how much
of our energy and time is wasted over this? Often a person who raises
opposition is considered to be a leader and, therefore,  those  who
aspire to become leaders oppose things. But we are what we are and we
have to find a way out of the existing difficulties.</p>

I do not wish to be sarcastic but this language slavery has gone so
deep that one begins to wonder. When even Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s
daughter-in-law, who, poor thing, certainly does not know much
English, is so obsessed with teaching her son English words, what am
I to say of others? It makes me unhappy. If mothers could solve this
question of language we could be free of English and develop the
national language. Without doubt English is a very rich and beautiful
language. And if one learns it or teaches it out of love for it I
should have no objection. But thus to impose words on an innocent
child is nothing but an instance of our deep-rooted and incurable
slavery.</p>

Yesterday was Diwali and today is the New Year. I have heard and I
heard it all the more yesterday that Delhi has great illuminations on
Diwali day which perhaps beat even the illuminations in Bombay. There
are magnificent illuminations in Bombay every year. I was pleased to
hear that people had realized that this is not the time to celebrate
Diwali. But the superstition still persists that there should be at
least some lights on Diwali day. Hence, oil lamps were seen at some
places. There were some electric lights, too, though very few. I do
not go out but I get all the information.</p>

The new year begins today. I had already mentioned it yesterday, but
I may as well refer to it again. On New Year day we make some pious
resolutions and by the grace of God try to follow them all through
the year. If we do this, and if the atmosphere prevailing today
changes and the Hindus and Muslims live together in amity, we shall
have a right to celebrate the next Diwali with illuminations. We can
accomplish nothing by regarding one another as enemies. That is why I
stressed that this is no occasion for an outward celebration of
Diwali. We should try to illumine our hearts. Rama resides in our
hearts and there is a continuous battle between Rama and Ravana
raging inside us. If, in our hearts and not outside, Ravana triumphs
over Rama, it means that there is no light  but  darkness in our
hearts. If, instead, it is Rama who triumphs over Ravana, then there
is indeed light in our hearts and this entitles us to have
illuminations outside as well. Hence, all is well if the light
outside is the symbol of the light within. Instead, if there is
darkness in our hearts and we have illuminations outside and try to
convince ourselves that everything is fine, we are hypocrites and
liars. I only hope that we are never untruthful.</p>

opinion that it has been the policy of the Congress since its
inception, that is, for the last sixty years, that Congress is not an
institution that propagates any particular religion. There are people
of all religions in the Congress or, say, because it belongs to
people of different religions, it does not belong to any one
particular religion. It is an organization of the masses and it has
to function only for political goals. It does not remain a religious
body if it functions that way. Supposing one of the policies of the
Congress is to provide food to all the people, to be true to its name
it must provide food for everybody. If the Congress provides food
only to those who are with it or, say, only to the Hindus and the
Sikhs because they are in a majority and allows others to starve and
says that it is not bothered about them, it would be a religious body
superficially but in fact it would become an irreligious
organization. If it  advocates  service of only those who are its
followers and wants others to be killed, it would not be dharma, but

If I am a worshipper of Rama and do not worship any god, the law
cannot force me to do so. It is another matter if I act against my
faith or become a coward and say that a particular man is carrying a
sword and that if I do not obey him he would kill me. But, if I am
not  a coward, when I am forced to worship Allah instead of Rama, I
should have, and I have, a right to insist that I would worship only
Rama and not Allah. All that the other person can do is to cut my
throat. Let him do so. Then it is a matter of faith, which we call
personal or individual dharma. There is no power on earth which can
destroy one’s personal dharma. Of course, it can be destroyed when
the individual himself wants to do it, or when, instead of light,
there is only darkness in one’s heart. In such circumstances, when

bidding of some other person because he is surrounded by darkness.
But the person who is steadfast in his faith would listen  to  the
command only of God and none else. Likewise, when an organization
functions for the welfare of the people, only the things which are
consistent with dharma apply to everybody and nothing else. And in
this way it embodies dharma and not <i>adharma. </i>That, in my view,
is the true meaning of politics and the Congress has followed this
from the time of its inception. You should be happy that it is so,
whether you belong to the Congress or not. Even I do not belong to
the Congress. But so what? After all, I have been a Congress worker
and have served it. What does it matter if I do not pay four annas
for membership? I must pay the membership fee of four annas if I want
to be its President. But that is not the question. If all of you
think like me, it is really remarkable. It is good if you have
registered yourselves as Congress members. It is well, too, if you
are serving the Congress from outside. I have been sitting with the
Congress Working Committee for the past three days. There are many
differences of opinion in the Working Committee. The members are
human beings after all, they are not stones. One member says one
thing and another member says something else. There may be
differences of opinion, but there should be no contradiction in
behaviour. That is why they spent three days in discussing these
differences. But they are all united about one thing, that is, that
the Congress should continue to be what it has been so far. If in the
process it has to perish, let it perish. Of course it cannot be
completely wiped out, though it can remain in minority. And I doubt
if it is in majority at present. For there should have been no
Pakistan if the Congress were in majority. I can quote many instances
to show how much the Muslims have been oppressed in India. But what
should I say? You know more than I do. Have the Hindus and the Sikhs
in Pakistan been oppressed less? But let us not talk about it. It is
not for us to think of those things. Should I stop following my
religion because others in the world do not adhere to theirs? That is
why the Congress, whether it is in majority or minority, must adhere
to its original objective. It is framing its resolutions from that
point of view. It wants to present its views in a straightforward,
sincere manner. What can be more straightforward than that we do not
wish to compel a single Muslim to go away from here? The point is not
whether the Muslims are good or bad. Can we claim that only angels
have a right to live in India, and, if not angels, only good people
can remain here? And, if only the good people can live here,</p>

are there no bad or wicked people among the Hindus and the Sikhs? And
if there are wicked people among them, what would you say to them?
Would you order them to leave and threaten to cut their throats with
a sword if they refused to oblige? You have no right to consider
anybody wicked or to kill him. We have committed excesses against the
Muslims. There may be some exaggeration in the reports I receive
every day. But ultimately I find that there is truth in those
reports. When anything is done in the name of the Congress, the A. I.
C. C. has to be summoned. The plenary session of the Congress is held
once a year. It is like a big show and because there is such a big
crowd nobody can even think clearly. But they know that the A. I. C.
C. carries on its work with due deliberation and so they put their
seal on what it does. Thus the A.I.C.C.is always on the alert. It is
going to meet the day after tomorrow. It is the Working Committee
which has to place the agenda before the A I. C. C. It is subservient
to the A. I.</p>

C. C. If it does anything in its own name, it does not have the same
effect. For, what is the use of 15 individuals proclaiming that not a
single Muslim should be killed? If the same thing is done in the name
of the A. I. C. C., its effect is much greater. That is why I have
been advising the Congress Working Committee for the past three days
that it should categorically state that this is the only thing it
wishes to carry out. Let us not worry if this pleases the people or
displeases them. If we are true servants of the Congress, then this
is the only thing we have to do. Let the A. I. C. C. brush it aside
if it so wishes. After all we, and also Pakistan, have to stand
before the world. We do many things because we are worried about what
the world may say. I would say that you should do only what you think
is correct. Then the world too would regard it as correct. It is said
that the word of the  <i>Panch</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

C. such a resolution which would bring victory to India  and 
everybody would be able to live in peace here. It does not mean that
we should let the traitors do as they please. But we should not take
it for granted that a particular person is a traitor. If someone is
proved to be a traitor, you may kill him, hang him, shoot him. But if
you say that no Muslim can ever be loyal or that only the Hindus and
the Sikhs have a monopoly of loyalty, then I would say that it would
be a grave thing. I am confident that the Congress would never do
such a thing. You must also pray that through the advice of the
Congress we and the whole country as well as other parts of the world
rise high. The Congress is meant only to raise the country high. But
the  Congress does not wish to raise itself by depriving anybody of
his wealth or other property. The Congress would die for the sake of
the whole world, but would not kill anyone. This has been the
objective of the Congress, not since I entered it, but for many
years. The Congress has tried to prevent the Europeans who come here
from looting the country, so that people of Asia and Africa could
live in peace. India has to remain alive for this purpose. It is for
this that India  has  attained her independence and for no other
purpose.</p>

For the last few days meetings of the Working Committee have been
going on. Its resolutions, I am sure, will be good. How far they will
be put into practice God only knows. My suggestion is that, in so far
as the Congress was intended solely to achieve swaraj and that
purpose has been gained—personally I do not think that what we have
gained is swaraj but at least it is so in name—this organization
should be wound up and we should put to use all the energies of the
country. In this way we shall be able to do a great deal. For
instance, Jayaprakash<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>has immense  energy.  But  he  does  not  come  forward
because of party considerations. I therefore feel that if the country
can get the benefit of whatever energy each one of us has, it will
prosper.</p>

I have no doubt at all that so long as prominent people do not
propagate Hindustani, it will decline. That means that our culture
will die. It is our misfortune that these days in our homes father
and son and brothers and sisters speak only English. Not even their 
own mother tongue! When the ocean is on fire who can put out the
fire?</p>

I would like to mention only one thing in that connection, and it is
that I survived for 21 days not because of the amount of water I used
to drink, or the orange juice which I took for some days, or the
extraordinary medical care, but because I had installed in my heart
God whom I call Rama. I was so much attracted by the lines of this
<i>bhajan </i>that I instructed the persons concerned to send me the
correct words by telegram, as I had forgotten those words at the
time. I was very happy when I received the whole <i>bhajan </i>by
reply telegram. The essence of the <i>bhajan </i>is that Ramanama is
everything and other gods count for nothing compared to Him. I am
mentioning this instructive episode in my life because I want the A.
I. C. C. members to think and deliberate with God in their hearts
when they meet for the important session on Saturday. They will have
to do so because they are representatives of all Congressmen. Hence,
if the leading Congressmen have Satan instead of God in their hearts
they are not true to their salt.</p>

question arose as to how the Hindu and the Sikh refugees could be
honourably and safely sent back to their homes in West Punjab. They
came to the conclusion that the trouble started from the Pakistan

but they also realized that when the wrong was copied on such a large
scale and when the Hindus and the Sikhs resorted to acts of
retaliation in East Punjab and the adjoining areas of the Union, the
question of where the trouble started became insignificant. If the A.
I. C. C. could claim with confidence that so far as the Indian Union
was concerned, the days of madness were over and sanity reigned from
one end of the Union to the other, the Committee could also say that
the Dominion of Pakistan would be obliged to call back the Hindu and 
Sikh refugees with honour and safety. Such a situation can be created
only when all Hindus and Sikhs install Rama in their hearts instead
of Ravana. For, when you drive Satan out of your hearts and give up
the present madness, every Muslim child will be able to move about
with as much freedom as a Hindu or a Sikh child. Then, I have no
doubt, the Muslim refugees who have left their homes under duress
will gladly come over and the way will be cleared for the honourable
and safe return of the Hindu and Sikh refugees to Pakistan.</p>

I have no faith in the prognosis of doctors. I would rather that
regardless of what they say you had faith in God and  let  things
happen as they would. In your condition, instead of reading
newspapers, should you not read books? Read Sanskrit or Gujarati.
There are beautiful translations of Sanskrit books in  Gujarati.
Whatever occurs to you while reading, you can dictate. Why don’t
you engage a person who would take dictation and read out what you
wish to hear? Waccha had almost gone blind but till the last moment
he had his favourite books read out to him. Several such instances

I am aware that I cannot see truth if I am impatient. It means
nothing that I am free of pride in the eyes of the world. If it
should be untrue, ahimsa would still be a long way off. The same
about truth. In that case the very idea of the success of
non-violence cancels itself out. Where there is non-violence, failure
is impossible. So, wherever there is failure, all that can be said is
that there had been no non- violence. It is another question as to
who can distinguish between success and failure. I cannot be a
witness to faults like pride, impatience, etc., I may be having. To a
certain extent, only outsiders can be witness. The true witness is
only God.</p>

Congress is of Indians, of all those who inhabit this land, whether

Though it is not true of the whole of India, yet there are many

“How can I go there when there is a fire raging here?” He replied

could do so. I did achieve some result in Calcutta. Peace is a simple

reduced to such a state that not even an old man or a child feels
safe, if he happens to be a Muslim. Under such circumstances we  have

the seriousness of the situation, it is your duty to relieve
Kripalani. He himself confesses his inability to keep the reins of
the Congress in his hands. When your pilot reports to you that he is
unable to steer your ship, will you still say to him, ‘Never mind
what happens, but you remain at your post’? You should therefore
forget about the four months and not worry about constitutional
proprieties. What would you do if an accident happened to me? Law

The second point I wish to talk to you about is the  Hindu-Muslim
relations to which I have already made a reference. I am ashamed of
what is happening today; such things should never happen in India. We
have to recognize that India does not belong to Hindus alone, nor
does Pakistan to Muslims. I have always held that if Pakistan belongs
to Muslims alone, then it is a sin which will destroy Islam. Islam
has never taught this. It will never work if Hindus as Hindus claim
to be a separate nation in India and Muslims in Pakistan. The Sikhs
too have now and again talked of a Sikhistan. If we indulge in these
claims, both India and Pakistan will be  destroyed,  the Congress
will be destroyed and we shall all be destroyed.</p>

I maintain that India belongs both to Hindus and Muslims. You may
blame the Muslim League for what has happened and say that the
two-nation theory is at the root of all this evil and that it was the
Muslim League that sowed the seed of this poison; nevertheless I say
that we would be betraying the Hindu religion if we did evil because
others had done it. Ever since my childhood I have known that
Hinduism teaches us to return good for evil. The wicked sink under
the weight of their own evil. Must we also sink with them? My own
experience of sixty years has confirmed what Hinduism has taught me
and my study of other religions has revealed the same thing. Islam
too says the same thing. It is the basic creed of the Congress that
India is the home of Muslims no less than of Hindus. I also know that
the Congress has had no hand in what has happened. I do not need to
quote the authority of the Congress Constitution to support my claim.</p>

It is held by some that if we perpetrate worse atrocities on Muslims
here than what have been perpetrated on Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan,
it will teach the Muslims in Pakistan a salutary lesson.</p>

They will indeed be taught a lesson, but what  will  happen  to  you
in the mean while? You say that you will not allow Muslims to stay in
India, but I hold it to be an impossibility to drive away  three-
and-a-half crores of them to Pakistan. What crime have they
committed? The Muslim League indeed is culpable, but not every
Muslim. If you think that they are all traitors and fifth-columnists,
then shoot them down by all means, but to assume that they are all
criminals because they are Muslims is wrong. If you bully them, beat
them, threaten them, what can they do but run away to Pakistan? After
all, life is dear to them. But it is unworthy of you to treat them
so. Thereby you will degrade the Congress, degrade your religion and
degrade the nation.</p>

If you realize this, then it is your duty to recall all those Muslims
who have been obliged to flee to Pakistan. Of course those of them
who believe in Pakistan and wish to seek their happiness there are
welcome to migrate. For them there is no bar. They will not need
military protection to escort them. They go of their own will and at
their own expense. But those who are leaving today have to  be
provided with special transport and special protection. Such
unnatural exodus under artificial conditions must cause us shame. You
should declare that those Muslims who have been obliged to  leave 
their homes and wish to return are welcome in your midst. You should
assure them that they and their religion will be safe in India. This
is your duty, this is your religion. You must be humane and
civilized, irrespective of what Pakistan does. If you do what is
right Pakistan will sooner or later be obliged to follow suit.</p>

As things are we cannot hold our heads high in the world today and
have to confess that we have been obliged to copy Pakistan in its
misdeeds and have thereby justified its ways. How can we go on like
this? What is happening is a provocation to war on both sides and
must inevitably lead to it. You will then have to part company with
Jawaharlal. And yet it is because of him that we are held in high
esteem in the world today. He is respected outside India as one of
the world’s greatest statesmen. Many Europeans have told me that
the world has not known such a high-minded statesman. I have known
Americans who hold Jawaharlal in higher esteem than they hold
President Truman. Even those who have fabulous wealth, vast armies
and the atom bomb respect the moral worth  of Jawaharlal’s
leadership. We in India ought to have due appreciation for it.</p>

I repeat to you that it is your prime duty to treat Muslims as your
brothers, whatever may happen in Pakistan. We will not return blow
for blow but will meet it with silence and restraint. Restraint will
add to your strength. But if you copy what happens in Pakistan, then
on what moral basis will you take your stand? What becomes of your
non-violence? If you approve of what has happened, then you must
change the very creed and character of the All-India Congress
Committee. This is the basic issue before you. Until you have faced
it, you cannot solve any of the problems that are before you. When
your house is on fire you must first put out the flames before you
can do anything else. That is why I have taken so much of your time.
Let all Muslims who have left their homes and fled to Pakistan come
back here. India is big enough to keep them as well as the Hindu and
Sikh refugees who have fled from Pakistan. What I wish to emphasize
to you is that if you maintain the civilized way, whatever Pakistan
may do now, sooner or later, she will be obliged by the pressure of
world opinion to conform. Then war will not be necessary and you will
not have to empty your exchequer.</p>

One more point. I understand that a hundred-and-fifty thousand
Muslims are about to be sent to Pakistan. You will say, they belong
to the criminal tribes who are better sent to Pakistan. Why should
they have to go? If there are criminal tribes in India, whose fault
is it? We are to blame for not having reformed them. They were here
during the British regime. Was there any talk of deporting them then?
It is wrong of us to send them away because they are “criminal”.
Our duty should be to reform them. How shameful it is for us that we
should force them to trudge three hundred miles on foot! I am against
all such forced exodus.</p>

Another problem that has arisen in the wake of the British withdrawal
from India is the claim on the part of rulers of Indian States to do
as they please. These rulers were kept in power by the British as
henchmen of British imperialism. Some of these rulers have indeed
tried to reform their ways and have adjusted their claims to the
rights of their people. But the same cannot be said of all of them,
though the number of the recalcitrant ones is very small. Their
assertion of independence is as untenable as their claim to rule as
they please is wrong. Because we are independent it does not mean
that each one of us is free to do as he pleases. Such freedom means
the end of all freedom. I therefore plead with these rulers to seek
their good in the common good. If they do not carry the people with
themselves, they will invite their own doom. I do not wish this to
happen. If the Princes wish to survive, they can do so only as the</p>

I claim to be an orthodox sanatanist. I know that my religion does
not advocate untouchability. The mission of the Hindu Mahasabha is to
reform Hindu society, to raise the moral level of the people. How
then can the Sabha advocate the compulsory evacuation of all Muslims
from India, as I am told it does? I know what some people are saying.
‘The Congress has surrendered its soul to the Muslims. Gandhi? Let
him rave as he will. He is a wash out. Jawaharlal is no better. As
regards Sardar Patel there is something in him. A portion of him is
sound Hindu, but he too is after all a Congressman.’ Such talk will
not help us. Where is an alternative leadership? Who is there in the
Hindu Mahasabha who can replace Congress leadership? Violent rowdyism
will not save either Hinduism or Sikhism. Such is not the teaching of
<i>Guru </i><i>Granthsaheb. </i>Christianity does not teach these
ways. Nor has Islam been saved by the sword. I hear many things about
the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. I have heard it said that the Sangh
is at the root of all this mischief. Let us not forget that public
opinion is a far more potent force than a thousand swords. Hinduism
cannot be saved by orgies of murder. You are now a free people. You
have to preserve this freedom. You can do so if you are humane and
brave and ever-vigilant, or else a day will come when you will rue
the folly which made this lovely prize slip from your hands. I hope
such a day will never come.</p>

You will forgive me for taking so much of your time. There is yet
another point. “Control” is a vicious thing. It is responsible
for much of the corruption that is rampant today. I am receiving

not abolish control immediately, you will one day regret it. It makes
people lazy and helpless. Do away with it. But before you proceed to

I think you would naturally expect me to convey to you what I said at
the A.I.C.C. meeting in the afternoon. But I do not feel like
repeating what I said. As a matter of fact I had said the same thing
which I have been telling you all these days. If I am sincerely
regarded as the Father of the Nation, it is true only in the sense
that, after my return from South Africa in 1915, I had a big hand in
giving the Congress the shape it acquired later. This means that I
exercised a great influence throughout the country. But today I
cannot claim that. I am not worried about it; at least I should not
be. Everyone should do his duty and leave the result to God. Nothing
happens without the will of God. Our duty is only to make the effort.
Hence, I had gone to attend the A.I.C.C. meeting with the idea that
if I was allowed to address the members before the deliberations
started, I would put before them what in my view is truth .</p>

I feel that continuing the controls is criminal. The policy of
controls might have been good during the War. It may be good even
today for a military nation. But it is harmful for India. I am sure
that there is no scarcity of food or cloth in the country. The rains
have not betrayed us this year. There is enough cotton in our country
and enough people to work on the spinning-wheels and the looms. Apart
from these, there are mills in the country. That is why I feel that
both the controls are bad. We have also control on petrol, sugar,
etc. I do not see any logical reason why we should have controls on
such  things. Controls make people lazy and dependent. Laziness and
dependence are bad for the country at any time. I receive daily
complaints about the controls. I hope that the representatives of the
country would come to a wise decision and would advise the Government
to remove the controls that encourage corruption, hypocrisy and black
market.</p>

As to his statement on Pakistan, in my opinion, Khwaja Saheb has
overshot the mark. I can understand their objecting to propaganda in
favour of reunion backed by action. But how can they ban the holding

Government’s present policy, or the cultivation of public opinion
in favour of those views? You should see Khwaja Saheb personally or

I think you or I could hardly have anything to say about it. As for

like it if you have a Persian wheel instead of an engine, but the

I can offer no solution whatsoever in the case of Chandra- prakash. I

It will be a welcome attitude if we give in to his objection, in case
Aryanayakum raises one in the matter of the potter. I may not
understand all his decisions. But that is a different matter. If the
potter could live on his own, if he is a good person and an expert
pot-maker, we ought to accommodate him, irrespective of
Chandraprakash’s presence or otherwise. If his is a case of leprosy
we should put up with it. Moreover, I understand it is not yet in a
contagious form. This simplifies the problem.</p>

I have read your advice. Is it not a fact that though Narasinh Mehta
used to sing his <i>bhajans </i>in the midst of Harijans these
<i>bhajans </i>are today chanted in your temples? Hence all advice is
like soap-suds. Soap does produce lather; but this lather alone does
not remove the dirt. Clothes become clean only when they are rubbed
with hands. Similarly, if you wish to understand the nature of my
work,  you should delve deeper into it; otherwise all this is like
pebbles inside a dried gourd.</p>

Yes, what you say is true. The political atmosphere has become

everything lived in such love. For her God was all in all.</p>

The ruler of the Rampur State is a Muslim. But that does not mean
that it is a Muslim State. The late Ali Brothers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

the then Nawab also, for he was a friend of the well-known
nationalist Muslims of the day, the late Hakim Ajmal Khan<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

there more peacefully and in greater harmony than today. But the
Hindu friends who came last Sunday from that place to meet me had an
altogether different tale to tell. They told me that though that
State had acceded to the Indian Union it was still under the
insidious influence of the Muslim League. Had that been the only
obstacle, it could have been easily overcome. But there is also the
Hindu Mahasabha assisted by members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak
Sangh who wish that all the Muslims should be driven away from the
Indian Union.</p>

There is no room in it for narrow communalism. It is one of the

people. The Rampur Congressmen are gaining strength for their

Nations, they said in plain words that Indians in South Africa were
not given the same treatment as the whites. They are being insulted
there and boycotted as if they were outcastes. It is true that the
Indians in South Africa are not poor and hungry. But man cannot live
by bread alone. Money has no value before human rights. And the South
African Government does not give these rights to Indians there. The
Hindus and the Muslims in India do not have divided views on the
problems concerning the Indians living abroad. This only proves that
the two-nation theory is incorrect. The lesson which I have learnt
from it and which is also the lesson people should learn after my
mentioning it today is that love is the highest thing. If the Hindus
and the Muslims can speak unitedly outside India, they can certainly
do so here as well, provided there is love in their hearts. Man is
prone to commit mistakes. But he can rectify his mistakes if he wants
to. This too is natural for man. It is always  possible  to  forgive 
and  forget.  If  we  can  do  this  today  and can speak with one 
voice  here  as  we  do  outside,  then we  would get over our
present troubles. As far as South Africa is concerned, I hope their
government and the whites there would profit by what is being openly
said by distinguished Hindus and Muslim with one voice.</p>

people become lethargic or indulge in malpractices and as a result
suffer death? The Government should find out ways and means to remove
lethargy and take steps to eradicate malpractices. It should not
procure foodgrain by fair means or foul and encourage malpractice and
lethargy.</p>

But I don’t wish to write a treatise here. The people of Gujarat
know how to carry on trade and there are skilled farmers there. The
soil is fertile and water is available. What do they think? Is it
true that lethargy and malpractice are behind this scarcity of food?
If not, why should there be need for control in Bombay? Even if
lethargy and malpractice are there, is it not possible to overcome
them? Why cannot the farmers and businessmen of Gujarat or rather the
whole of Bombay province prove that there is no scarcity of food and
cloth and, even if there is, it can be removed immediately? Can they
not do this much?</p>

I admit it is my failure that I could not write to you in my own
hand. But these days there are a great many instances of such failure
on my part. Strength is limited and work is heavy. Today  is
silence-day and I am therefore able to write this letter, though, to
be sure, the shoulder is feeling the strain now. I am sad that you
have fallen ill again. But one must pay the penalty demanded of the
body. You did well in going to Calcutta again. I hope they will carry

As a last resort you have Ramanama. But its success depends on one
condition being fulfilled, like the success of  any  other
experiment. Ramanama has its full effect only when it proceeds from
the heart. The habit of mechanical repetition must of  course be
formed in any case. From the lips it may by and by sink into the
heart. That is why we pray aloud. I expect another letter from you.</p>

will mean controls over our minds too, and we shall not be able to
taste the sweet fruit of freedom. Many people argue the case before
me; but when I start asking questions they cannot answer them. I
agree that it would be good if we could provide jobs for the staff
that will be retrenched when controls are removed. I feel like
laughing when these people, motivated by their self-interest for the
time being, argue that a revolt would erupt in India if there were no
controls. But at the same time I also feel depressed. I would remove
controls even at the cost of a revolt. That has always been my way. I
have travelled thus far through fiery ordeals. And I have limitless
faith in God. Don’t we have a proverb, “He who has provided the
teeth will also provide the food?” There is an element of truth in
it. But there must also be full effort.</p>

Yesterday I spoke about Rampur and our countrymen in South Africa.
Today I feel I must deal more fully with the latter subject. I have
lived in South Africa for twenty years from 1893 to 1914 with a break
probably of one year. During that long and formative period of my
life I came naturally in closest contact with all kinds of Indians as
also with the white settlers of that sub-continent almost as big as
ours. Between then and now if South Africa has risen, India has made
giant strides. What seemed to be impossible only the other day  has
happened. We need not go into the causes. The fact is that India has
come into the British Commonwealth, i.e., she has exactly the same
status as the Union of South Africa. Should members of  one Dominion
be helots in another Dominion? An Asiatic nation enters the
Commonwealth for the first time in its history with the willing
consent of all the members of the Commonwealth.</p>

It is worthy of note that Dr Barnard evidently doubts whether the
entry was a great event. And then he treats the Natal Indian Congress
with the gratuitous advice that the Indians of South Africa should
emigrate to India and become “missionaries of the gospel they have
been taught in South Africa, namely, to live in peace and order and
not to fight in communal riots”. I very much fear that this message
is typical of the average white man’s mind in the South African
Dominion. Hence the series of disabilities on our countrymen</p>

for the crime of being Asiatics and having a coloured pigment. I
appeal to the best western mind of South Africa to revise this
anti-Asiatic and anti-colour prejudice. They have an overwhelming
African population in their midst. They are worse treated in some
respects than the Asiatics. I urge the European settlers to read the
signs of the times. Either this prejudice is wrong from every point
of view or the British people and their fellow-members of the great
Commonwealth have made an unpardonable mistake in admitting Asiatic
countries as members. Burma is about to get her independence,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Responsible men and women of these  independent States need to ponder
well as to what they will do with their independence. Is all this
movement towards multiplying independent States, though proper and
healthy in itself, to result in another war more deadly, if possible,
than the last two, or is it to end, as it should, in the promotion of
universal brotherhood?</p>

I must keep you for a moment over the much-debated question of
control. Must the voice of the people be drowned by the noise of the
pundits who claim to know all about the virtue of controls? Would
that our ministers who are drawn from the people and are of the
people listened to the voice of the people rather than of the
controllers of the red-tape which, they know, did them infinite harm
when they were in the wilderness! The pundits then ruled with a
vengeance. Must they do so even now ? Will not the people have any
opportunity of committing mistakes and learning by them? Do the 
ministers  not know that they have the power to resume control
wherever necessary, if decontrol is found to have been harmful to the
people, in any instance out of the samples, by no means exhaustive,
that I am giving below? The list before me confounds my simple mind.
There may be virtue in some of them. All I contend is that the
science, if it is one of controls, requires a dispassionate
examination and then education of the people in the secret of
controls in general or specified controls. Without examining the
merits of the list I have received I pick out a few out of the
samples given to me: Control on exchange, investment capital issues,
opening branches of banks and their investments, insurance
investments, all import and export of every kind of commodity,
cereals, sugar, <i>gur, </i>cane, and syrup, <i>vanaspati, </i>textile,
including woollens, power, alcohols, petrol and kerosene, paper,
cement, steel, mica, manganese, coal, transport, installation of
plant, machinery, factories, distribution of cars in certain
provinces and tea-plantation.</p>

	Chi. Manudi took, or it would be equally true to say, I gave her,
	about ten minutes before writing this letter to you. She read out
	your letter to me and asked a question. In answer to that I gave her
	a long lecture. Has it not become my profession to lecture people? I
	would not be surprised if it only justified the ancient Sanskrit
	saying “wise in advising others”. Because today unforeseen
	events are overtaking us from all sides, I am fumbling in the dark
	in search of a way out. Your letter is certainly inspiring; but I
	have to do or die here. If heart unity is not restored in Delhi, I
	can see flames raging all over India. And I have no strength, nor
	the courage to reach that far. I would much rather spend myself in
	Delhi.</p>

	I must admit that only the intellectuals and political leaders are
	responsible for the present distressing atmosphere. The poor
	peasants in the villages do not even know that India has become
	free. Hence I have not the least hesitation in saying that we are
	grossly abusing the intelligence and energy which God has bestowed
	upon us. Now you will understand what it is I am trying to put
	across or what pain fills my heart. My prayer today is “one step
	enough for me” <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>.
	I am keeping well in spite of all that is happening and I hope you
	are also well. The fact that one can keep fit physically and
	mentally, whatever the circumstances be, is a sign of one’s
	nearness to God. My Rama is not a man with two hands and two feet.
	But if I am perfectly fit it is due to Rama’s grace. Chi. Manudi
	is well trained. But after all she is only a girl, in the playful
	age of 16 or 17—she is almost a child. When I discuss with her or
	dictate to her such spiritual subjects, it occurs to me how dense I
	was at the age of 18. As compared to that, this girl has developed
	quite well. At the same time I am  also conscious that I may be
	putting too heavy a burden on her tender mind with my discussions or
	dictations of such highly pedantic matters. But she is always very
	happy and keeps cheerful. Only she does not take care of herself,
	because of which I have to scold her</p>

You must have  read  the  resolutions<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>passed  by  the  All-India Congress Committee. Some
of those resolutions are useful in our life—in a good part of our
life. It may as well be said that they are useful in the life of
every man. They are not the resolutions merely to be implemented by
the Government. For instance, the resolution on controls is the one
which has to be implemented by Jawaharlal, Rajendra Prasad—now
Rajendra Prasad is out—and also by others. They have to implement
the policy of control on food, cloth and every other thing. We too
have to do the same thing. If we resort to cheating and do not abide
by the law, the result would be disastrous. When we can do with one
yard of cloth, why should we buy ten yards and try to convince
ourselves that no harm will be done if it is bought and tucked away
in the house? If we develop such an attitude, become self-centred and
not think of India we will turn into rogues.</p>

The resolutions of the All-India Congress Committee are so important
that I wanted to explain them to you one by one. I am still here, and
I shall say something about the resolutions if I get a chance. But
let me at least tell you the substance today. There is a resolution
about bringing back the people who have left their homes in panic and
this resolution applies to everybody. All of us, from Kanyakumari to
Kashmir, belong to India. What if India has been divided All of us
have to shoulder the responsibility because we are all brothers. If
only one individual goes on stuffing his belly and does not care for
the poor—if he eats for pleasure—he is stealing and commits a
crime against India. What if India does not possess all the foodgrain
she requires? The poor also should get foodgrain. If the rich get
just a few <i>chhataks</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 
 </font></sup>and are able to manage with the same I would consider
that the rich and the poor have become equal. Apart from anyone else,
let me talk about the rich person in whose house I am living. If you
ask me whether Shri Ghanshyamdas manages with his legitimate quota, I
would say he does not. I have got to tell the truth after all.

all those who come here are able to have milk. I get milk. I do not

milk for me, whether he has to keep one goat or two; and to get the

provides for me greens or fruits, whatever I want. I do not ask him
from where he gets those things. Something must be offered to the

are given fruit juice. He owns property worth crores of rupees. That
is the case with the wealthy people. Millionaires can get all those
things. But something can happen only when they deprive themselves a
little. How else can the poor get things for themselves? Let the rich
and the businessmen not indulge in profiteering. Let them become
honest. They may make profit but just enough to satisfy their hunger.
How wonderful if all of them would follow the same system about
profits! Why should there be control on food? There is no need at all
for it. It would be good indeed if everyone became like this.</p>

The most important thing is that we cannot rest in peace till all the
refugees go back to their homes. It is madness to kill the Muslims or
drive away those who have run away from Pakistan in panic leaving
their property there. Now the All-India Congress  Committee  has
issued orders that people have to be kept wherever they are, and in
comfort, and those who wish to return to their homes have to be sent
back. Thousands of millionaires managed to come away even leaving
their beautiful houses, but the poor are still left behind. I do not
intend speaking about every point today. But the resolution shows
where our duty lies. And that is the most important thing. If we take
it for granted that the Muslims are a worthless lot, it is a grave
sin. It is the supreme duty of all of us not to drive away anyone.
People have seen the Working Committee resolution three or four days
ago and they have also seen the indications in the Press. In spite of
that the Muslims are running away. People say that the A.I.C.C.
accepted this resolution because of my insistence. They say that the
Muslims should go away, otherwise they would be killed. People ask me
if I would be a witness to the slaughter of Muslims. I have already
said what I would do—I would ‘do or die,. When I am ready to die,
the Muslims too should be ready to die if the need arises. We have
become so heartless that we want them to walk 300 miles in this cold
winter. It is said that there are not too many deaths in the
camps—some ten or twenty die every day. Now, out of five, ten or
fifty thousand if so many people</p>

die, has anyone tried to estimate how many people would die in India
at this rate? Should it not be our concern as to how they die? Some
of them do not get food, some have cholera, some get dysentery, or
something else happens to them. But does anyone bother to know why
these people die? We are worried about the availability of food and
all the other things we need. We are always on the look-out for
settling the Hindus and the Sikhs in the houses of Muslim evacuees.
Of course, the situation is not the same everywhere. But it is
certainly so in many places. This has pained me very much  and  I 
have conveyed my feelings to you many times. Now even the A.I.C.C.
has said that what has happened is highly deplorable. This thing has
to be conveyed to the millions and it cannot be done in one day.
There are great men in the Government—Jawahar, the Sardar, Rajendra
Babu (but Rajendra Babu is not there now)—and how could [other
members] displease them? That is why they agreed to it. I have heard
that now there are even some Congressmen who think  that  the Muslims
should not live here. They think that only then can Hinduism prosper.
But they do not know that Hinduism is degenerating day by day. It
would be dangerous if they did not change their attitude. All the
members of the A.I.C.C. are the representatives of India as a whole.
If they are all one at heart, as they should be, then the entire face
of India would change. It is their duty not to allow anything else to
happen. Their primary task is to find out how they can bring back all
those who have fled from here. We would be restless till we brought
back all the Muslims who have gone away from India. We have to create
the necessary climate and that is not difficult. It is a great thing
that there are still 350 million Muslims in India. Nobody knows how
many have gone away and how many are going to come. Supposing all
those who have gone away came back, it would mean no expenditure, for
us, for they would be living in their own houses, since they have
their houses here. Our job is only to return their houses to them.
But are all those houses vacant? Refugees have occupied those houses
by force. But they would have to be accommodated in spite of that. If
we act without proper thought and if our hearts are not clean,
outsiders would wonder if the representatives of India were
hypocrites. I think they are not. Those days are over when we used to
be angry with the Muslims and wanted them to go away. Today we
consider them as our brethren.</p>

living in amity. But now I hear that the refugees have occupied the
houses of the Muslims and the Muslims want to go away to Pakistan.
The Muslims might say that they did not want to go to Pakistan
willingly as neither any delicacies nor good clothes would be
available there. And how could things be otherwise? The people there
are in the same condition as we are here. After all, it is not as if
there were more provisions for them there while they had nothing
here. Those who have gone away write back that it would have been
much better if they had remained in India. Having left their hearth
and home, they are now living in camps and are in great distress. It
is bound to be so. Then, why do the Muslims of Panipat want to go to
Pakistan? If that is so, Panipat is a test for me and I too may have
to go there. Panipat is about 50 miles from here. It cannot be called
a distant place. It is just like Delhi. Now, even if a single Muslim
is forced to go to Pakistan, it would hurt me and it would hurt you.
Of course, when they stay here, they must get food and clothes from
the money they receive. They are industrious, they earn and subsist
on it. How will they live if they earn money but cannot have food? If
the craftsmen, who have been like brothers, have to leave just
because refugees from the Punjab have come, nothing could be worse
than that. I would tell all the refugees at Panipat that they should
give up the houses of the Muslims and the Muslims too should say that
they would stay there. They should say that they do not need police
for protection and they would live in amity. The police should only
see to the distribution of food and clothes.  They  need  do  nothing
 more.  Then  I   would   say   that  the</p>

	committing suicide. And suicide is forbidden in all circumstances.
	If you yourself are good others at Sevagram will also be good.
	Sevagram is not something apart from you. People are afraid of you
	and, therefore, avoid asking you to do anything.  If  you  become
	steady in your mind, it will be easier for others to ask for your

We should be agreed on some matters at least, or should we not? Even
as regards language we have raised such a storm that one might think
a rebellion had broken out. The matter is simple. Our language should
be that which the millions of villagers in India can understand and
read with ease. If I had my way, I would give the same place to
language as has been given to khadi in the Congress Constitution. I
would allow only those who knew Hindustani to become members of the
Congress. We should now have no resolutions in English. How many
persons understand English in a mass meeting? But mine is like a pipe
of carrot<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>and
I continue to blow it whether or not it produces any sound.</p>

The problem of States will be solved easily in  most  cases. Among
the Kathiawar States, the attitude of Bhavnagar appears very sound,
although there have been no negotiations directly with the Raja yet.
I believe that his response will be good. Many of his men come here
for discussion.</p>

I am keeping well by God’s grace. I have no doubt that we shall
suffer if we neglect khadi. The Congress will not survive in a
democracy if it abandons any one of the constructive activities. No
party which does so will survive. The reason is that when you are
there at the helm of affairs, you have been entrusted with power by
the people in the hope that you will strive to relieve their misery.
If we do not make such efforts and neglect those which have already
been initiated, what fate will be in store for us? In the end, may
God grant good sense to all.</p>

Truth and ahimsa had been the weapons for achieving swaraj. Today we
have forgotten both. Actually it was my fault that I believed that
people had truth and ahimsa in them. But I was  mistaken. Anyway I
consider it my good luck that God has at last opened my eyes. And I
regard it as God’s grace that even if I can do nothing else at
least I shall now be able to do or die. I do not wish now to live for
125 years. I would either like to die bravely taking the name of God
or, if Hindus and Muslims became sincere friends, would tour the
whole of India and then go to Pakistan.</p>

Last evening I referred to the main Resolution on  Hindu- Muslim
relations passed by the A.I.C.C. But unfortunately today itself I
have to cite an instance to show how that Resolution  is  being
rendered futile in Delhi. I had never imagined that on  the  very
evening when I was expressing my doubt about the behaviour of the
public, that doubt would be proved right in the heart of old Delhi. I
was told last night that a large crowd of Hindus and Sikhs had</p>

gathered in front of a Muslim’s shop in Chandni Chowk. Though the
shop belonged to a Muslim, the owner had abandoned it and gone away.
The shop had been given to a refugee on condition that he would give
it up when the owner returned. Fortunately, the owner of the shop has
returned. He did not want to give up his business for good. The
officer in charge of the allotment came to the refugee and asked him
to vacate the shop. The refugee hesitated at first, but then agreed
to vacate it when the owner came to take possession in the evening.
When the officer went again in the evening he found that instead of
vacating the shop the occupant had informed his friends who had
collected there to overawe whoever [forced them] to vacate it. The
few constables at Chandni Chowk could not control the crowd, and they
sent for more help. The police or, may be, military arrived and fired
in the air. The crowd dispersed in panic, but a. pedestrian was
stabbed in the bargain. Fortunately the wound did not prove to be
fatal. But this demonstration of the trouble-makers had a  strange
result. That shop was not vacated. I do not know if the order of that
officer was defied or the shop has ultimately been vacated.
Nevertheless, I do hope that the Government will not fail to punish
the culprit if it has to retain its true authority under our precious
freedom. Otherwise, the Government will have no authority at all. 1
am told that the crowd of Hindus and Sikhs was not less than two
thousand.</p>

This is not the only thing. In other parts of Delhi, too, attempts
are being made to drive the Muslims out of their houses, so that the
Hindu and the Sikh refugees could be accommodated there.  The Sikhs
go about brandishing their swords and threaten the Muslims with dire
consequences if they refuse to give up their houses. I am also told
that the Sikhs drink liquor, the consequences of which can be well
imagined. They dance about with their naked swords and scare away the
pedestrians. I am also informed that according to custom Muslims do
not sell  <i>kababs</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

areas. But the Sikhs and perhaps other refugees, too, freely sell
these forbidden things there. This hurts the feelings of the Hindus
in that locality. The nuisance has grown to such an extent that
people cannot easily pass through the crowded Chandni Chowk.</p>

As for the <i>kirpans, </i>the Sikhs have been forbidden by law to
carry <i>kirpans </i>larger than the prescribed size. While this law
is in force, many Sikh friends come to me with a request that I
should try to have this restriction withdrawn. They told me about the
judgement passed by the Privy Council several years ago which
permitted the Sikhs to carry <i>kirpans </i>of any size. I have not
read that judgement. I think the judges have interpreted <i>kirpan </i>to
mean sword of any size. The then Punjab Government, in order to carry
out  the  Privy  Council’s decision, declared that everyone was
free to keep a sword. That is why in the Punjab men carry swords of
any size they choose.</p>

I have no sympathy with the Punjab Government or the Sikhs in this
matter. Some Sikh friends have brought to my notice certain portions
from the <i>Granthsaheb </i>which support my view that the <i>kirpan
</i><i>is </i>not a weapon to be used to attack the innocent. Only
the Sikhs abiding by the tenets of the <i>Granthsaheb </i>can use the
<i>kirpan </i>for the protection of innocent women, children and old
and helpless people. That is the reason why one Sikh is regarded
equal to one-and-a-quarter lakh opponents. That is why any Sikh who
takes intoxicants, who gambles, or is prey to other vices, has no
right to keep a <i>kirpan </i>which is a symbol of purity and
restraint and which is to be used only on particular occasions in a
prescribed manner.</p>

In my view, it is not only futile but also harmful to seek the help
of the now defunct judgement of the Privy Council to justify the
indiscriminate use of the <i>kirpan. </i>We have just freed ourselves
from foreign rule. It is highly improper to do away with all
necessary restrictions in our state of freedom, because, without
those restrictions, society cannot make progress. Hence, I would tell
my Sikh friends that they should not bring the great Sikh religion
into disrepute by using the <i>kirpan </i>for doubtful purposes. Let
them not destroy a  religion which has been shaped by a number of
martyrs in whose martyrdom the world takes great pride.</p>

I wash to draw your attention to another thing. I have been informed

Hence I hope that the information I have received does not apply to
these protectors of law and order, and that it is only an exception.
The army and the police should be the first to experience the glow
and excitement of freedom. Let not the people get a chance to say
that good behaviour can be expected of them only under strict
discipline imposed on them from above. They have to establish through
correct behaviour that they too can become good and ideal citizens of
India. If these protectors of law disregard law itself, it would be
difficult to carry on administration at all. And it would be all the
more difficult to implement the Resolutions of the All-India Congress
Committee.</p>

Mir Maqbool Sherwani was a young brave leader of  the National
Conference at Baramula. He had just entered his thirtieth year. On
learning that he was an important leader of the National Conference
the invaders tied him to two poles near the Nishat Talkies. They
first beat him up and then told him that he should give up the
National Conference and its leader Sheikh Abdullah, the lion of
Kashmir. They told Sherwani that he should swear loyalty to the
Provisional Government of Azad Kashmir which had its headquarters at
Palundry.</p>

On hearing this, the assailants were enraged and were in panic. They
riddled his body with fourteen bullets. They cut his nose and

same way.”</p>

greatest trial. It is the story of Narayan Singh, a Sikh ex-officer.
He has lost enormous property in West Punjab. Now he is in Delhi. He
has nothing left, which means that he would be compelled to beg or to
let death claim him. He met an old friend who he did not want to
suffer on his account because he was not bothered by his own
misfortune. The Sikh officer was very happy to meet Ali Shah, his old
friend and colleague. Ali Shah too has lost his entire property, but
not because of communal frenzy but because of some other misfortune.
He too is a courageous man like Narayan Singh and both of them are

twenty-five years, they were so happy that they forgot their
misfortune.</p>

I have received two notes from the same person. In one note he says

mistake to have given up his job. It is true that during the British
days I had exhorted people to give up their jobs and non-co-operate
with the Government. But that is not the case now. Anyone who wishes
to serve his country can do so while carrying on with his job. If
every wage-earner does his job honestly and without indulging in any

shortcomings to which my attention has been drawn. I am told that the

claim that I have true knowledge of how the cow can be saved.
However, I do admit that so far I have not exercised any influence on
the public which may lead them to give to the problem the attention
it deserves. Those who manage the goshalas know how to spend money or
collect funds for the purpose. But they have no knowledge at all
about rearing the cattle scientifically. They do not know how to rear
the cow so that it may yield more milk. They do not know how to rear
the oxen or improve their breed.</p>

That is why, throughout India, goshalas, instead of being the
institutions where one could learn the art of rearing the cattle,
where there would be ideal dairies providing the best quality of milk
and the best breed of cows and oxen, are places where the cattle are
herded together in a pitiable condition. The result is that India,
instead of being a prominent country where the best breed of cattle
and the best quality of milk should be available at the cheapest
rate, is the lowest in the world in this regard. The people managing
the goshalas do not even know that the dung and urine of the cattle
can be used most profitably. Nor do they know how best to utilize the
dead cattle. The result is that because of their ignorance crores of
rupees are being lost. An expert has stated that our cattle wealth is
only a burden on the country and deserves to be destroyed. I do not
agree with this view. But, if the general ignorance in this matter
persists for some time more, I will not be surprised if our cattle
become a burden on the country. That is why I hope that the
management of this goshala would do its best to make it an ideal
institution from every point of view.</p>

do not quite remember if she used to give a daily yield of 75 lbs. Of
milk or whether she really yielded so much milk at one time. That cow
used to roam about without any restriction anywhere she chose. Fodder
used to be kept for her at various places, which she could eat any
time she chose. This is the bright side of the picture. I have not
seen the other side of it. But I am authentically told that a large
number of male calves are killed, because all of them  cannot  be
turned into bullocks that can carry heavy weight. These dairies are
spread over hundreds of acres of land if not more. They are meant
specially for European soldiers, and crores of rupees have been spent
on them. Now that we no longer have the British soldiers in India, I
do not deem them necessary. I am sure that if the Indian soldiers
know that such expensive dairies are being run for their sake, they
will feel ashamed. I am also certain that the Indian soldiers will
not demand what ordinary citizens cannot claim as a matter of right.</p>

The most authentic and perhaps complete information about the cow and
the buffalo can be found in a voluminous treatise<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Pratishthan. It is not filled with extracts from other books but is
based on his personal experience and written during one of his
imprisonments. The book has been translated into Bengali and
Hindustani. Those who read it carefully would find it extremely
useful in improving the cattle breed and increasing the yield of
milk. There is a comparative study of the cow and the buffalo also in
the book.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

These are all relevant questions. I am no  great  scholar  of
history. I do not even claim to be a learned man. But I have read in
an authoritative book on Hinduism that the word “Hindu” does not
occur in the Vedas. When Alexander the Great invaded India, the
people living in the region east of the river Sindhu, which is called
the Indus by the English-speaking Indians, were described as the
Hindus. The letter ‘S’ of the Sindhu became ‘H. in Greek. The
religion of the people living in this region came to be known as
Hinduism which, as you are well aware, is the most tolerant of all
religions. It gave shelter to the Christians who had escaped from the
harassment of the people</p>

of other religions. Besides, it also gave shelter to the Jews known
as Beni-Israel and also to the Parsis. I feel proud to belong to
Hinduism which embraces all religions and is very tolerant. The Aryan
scholars followed the Vedic religion and India was first known as
Aryavarta. I do not wish that once again the country should be known
as  Aryavarta. The Hinduism of my conception is complete in itself.
Of course, it includes the Vedas, but it also includes many other
things. I do not think it is improper to say that I can proclaim the
same faith in the greatness of Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism
and  Judaism without in any way impairing the greatness of Hinduism.
Such Hinduism would live so long as the sun shines in the sky.

I cannot help mentioning the fact that according to the information
received by me 137 mosques have been almost destroyed in Delhi during
the riots. Some of them have been converted into temples. There is
one such mosque near Connaught Place which can never remain unnoticed
by anyone. Today there is a tri-colour flag flying over it. It has
been changed into a temple by installing an idol in it. Desecrating
the mosques in this manner is a blot on Hinduism and Sikhism. It is
gross <i>adharma </i>in my view. The blot which I have mentioned
cannot be wiped out by saying that even the Muslims in Pakistan have
desecrated the Hindu temples or changed them into mosques. In my

Sikhism or Islam.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

duty. I am told that the Roman Catholics are being harassed near
Gurgaon. This has happened in a village called Kanhai which is 25
miles away from Delhi. An Indian Roman Catholic priest and a
Christian missionary came to meet me. They showed me letter which
gave the description of the harassment of the Roman Catholics at the
hands of the Hindus. Surprisingly, the letter was written in Urdu. I
think the Hindus, the Sikhs and others living in that area can speak
only Hindustani and write only in the Urdu script. The persons who
brought the information told me that the Roman Catholics were
threatened, that they would have to suffer if they did not leave the
village. I hope this threat is unfounded and that the Christian men
and women would be allowed to follow their religion and carry on
their work without any hindrance. Now that we have freed ourselves
from political bondage, they, too, are entitled to the same freedom
to follow their religion and occupations as they had under the
British. The freedom we have achieved does not imply the rule of
Hindus in the Indian Union or that of Muslims in Pakistan. I have
already told you in one of my speeches<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that
when the anger of the Hindus and the Sikhs against the Muslims abated
it was likely to be directed against one another. But I did not
expect my prophecy would come true so soon. The anger against the
Muslims has not yet completely calmed down. As far as I know, these
Christians are absolutely innocent. It has been pointed out to me
that their only fault is that they are Christians. Their greater
fault is that they eat beef and pork. When out  of curiosity I asked
the priest if there was any truth in it, he said that those Roman
Catholics had on their own given up eating beef some time ago. If
such childish prejudice persists, the future of India is bound to be
dark. When the priest was at Rewari, he was deprived of his bicycle,
and he narrowly escaped death. Would this misery end only with the
extinction of all non-Hindus and non-Sikhs?</p>

One such letter is from Shri Shivabhai Patel of Bochasan Residential
School. He has sent me a few unvarnished facts  and figures of the
work done during the annual celebrations. He is ably assisted by
Gangabehn<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>of the late Satyagraha Ashram of Sabarmati’ now known
as the Harijan Ashram and the ever indefatigable Ravishankar Maharaj<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, with his two sons who have not deserted him. A
speciality of the recent celebration was that instead of the usual
mechanical contrivance for carding, they resorted exclusively to the
<i>tunai </i>process. This time the management was induced to begin a
boarding-house for the children of those who, in that part of India,
are considered to be a backward race. The beginning has been made
with only ten inmates. After seven years of suspension, they have
recommenced the day school for boys who have finished four years’
course in ordinary schools. They expect to have a further six years,
bringing the boys up to the matriculation standard minus English and
plus a good grounding in khadi work, carpentry or  agriculture. 
Unlike past years, during the year under observation, the parents
have become interested in the upright conduct of their children. The
result is that during the four months preceding the celebration of
October last, the boys who were given to hard smoking and drinking
strong tanning tea, have shed the habit which was ruining them. The
earnestness of the boys has affected their parents who have also
given up these evil habits that make chimneys of their mouths and
ruin their digestive apparatus. When the boys were admitted, they
could not sit still or hold their tongues for five minutes. They have
now learnt to enjoy hand-spinning in perfect silence for one hour.
Gangabehn who is in complete charge of the dairy of the institution
takes good care to provide pure cow’s milk.</p>

During the celebration days the students’ recitations consisted of
useful dialogues which were largely attended. They had also an
unpretentious exhibition of all the processes that cotton undergoes
before it comes out as khadi. Twenty-three students took part in a
competition—for neat calligraphy, a subject about which there is so
much indifference as if neatness of handwriting was no part of good

There are doctors, lawyers, students, teachers, nurses, etc., among
the refugees. If they segregate themselves from the poor refugees,
they would not be able to learn anything from their own misfortune. I
feel that all professional and non-professional, rich and poor
refugees should live together and build ideal cities just as the rich
people of Lahore made Lahore an ideal city which the Hindus and the
Sikhs had perforce to give up. Such cities would relieve the burden
of overcrowded cities like Delhi and this would lead to better health
and progress of the people living there. If over two lakh refugees at
the Kurukshetra camp become ideal in the matter of inner and outer
cleanliness, and if the professional and the rich people live with
the poor on terms of equality and live a life of contentment in these
colonies of tents, and if they do their own work, beginning with
sanitation, etc., and engage themselves in some  useful  work
throughout the day, they would cease to be a burden on the Government
treasury. And the people in the city, in their turn, would not stop
at merely admiring the simplicity and co-operation of the refugees,
but would feel ashamed of their own lives, and follow the good
example of the refugees. Then the present bitterness and mutual
jealousies would vanish in no time. And the refugees, no matter how
large their number may be, would no longer be a matter of worry for</p>

In the end, I would talk about removing controls, especially the
controls on food and cloth. The Government hesitates to remove
controls because it feels that there is a real scarcity of food and
cloth in the country, and the prices of these commodities will shoot
up if the controls are removed and the poorer sections will have to
suffer a great deal. The Government thinks that the poor can be saved
from starvation by continuing the controls and that they can be
provided sufficient clothes. The Government is suspicious about the
traders, cultivators and the middlemen. It fears that these people
are waiting like hawks for the removal of controls, so that they
could fill their pockets with tainted money at the cost of the poor.
The Government has to make a choice between the two evils. It thinks
that continuing rather than removing the controls is the lesser evil.</p>

That is why I appeal to the traders, middlemen and cultivators that
they should dispel these doubts about them and assure the Government
that the prices will not rise when the  controls are removed. It may
not be possible to root out black market and underhand dealings by
removing the controls but the poor would have a much easier time than
now.</p>

But the reluctance to enforce linguistic redistribution is perhaps
justifiable in the present depressing atmosphere. The exclusive
spirit is ever uppermost. Everyone thinks of himself and his family.
No one thinks of the whole of India. The centripetal force is
undoubtedly there, but it is not vocal, never boisterous; whereas the
centrifugal is on the surface, and in its very nature makes the
loudest noise, demanding the attention of all. It manifests itself
most in matters communal. This has given rise to fear in other
fields. The history of the  quarrel  between Orissa and Andhra,
Orissa and Bihar and Orissa and Bengal is fresh in our minds. The
whole of it has not died out even now. This is but an illustration of
an almost accomplished fact. The other provinces were never
redistributed in law though they were in 1920 when the Congress had a
brand new constitution<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>enabling it to put up a life-and-death struggle with
perhaps the greatest empire that has ever been. How will Madras,
though divided by the Congress divide itself into four provinces, and
Bombay do likewise in law? Many other claimants have come to the
fore. They are not recognized by the Congress but they are not less
vocal or less insistent. The Congress does not command the prestige
and authority it found  itself in possession of in 1920. Despair has
given place to hope. Now, when we have freedom, we seem not to know
what to do with it. It is almost mistaken for suicidal anarchy. Even
zealous  reformers  would postpone controversial issues to a more
hopeful time when, in the interest of the country, the virtue of
‘give and take’ would be freely recognized and all sectional
interests would be subordinate to the one interest of the good of
India, which will include the good of all. Therefore, these who, like
me, want constructive suggestions to come into play at this very
moment, have to work to bring about a healthy atmosphere, promoting
concord in the place of discord, peace in the place of strife,
progress in the place of retrogression and life in the place of
death. That happy day will be most manifest when the communal strife
has died out. Meanwhile, will the Southern linguistic groups settle
their disputes and boundaries, will Bombay produce an agreed scheme
of redistribution according to language, and will the new candidates
withdraw their claims at least for the time being? Then linguistic
redistribution can come into being today without the</p>

I should like to see the text of the order before I can believe it. I
feel sure that even if there is any order to some such effect, the
exact wording would bear a different meaning. I can understand the
criminality of such action. There are very few Hindus and certainly
not many Muslims who believe in the advisability or justice of the
step. But only a mad man would advocate any forcible measure to upset
the settled fact. The partition can be undone only by the willing
consent of both the parties. But even that consent will be
impossible, if no one is allowed to convert public opinion to the
side of unity.</p>

A Bengali friend writes a long letter in Bengali on the exodus from
East Pakistan. Its purport is that though workers like him understand
and appreciate my argument and distinction between death—courageous
and cowardly—the common man detects in my statement a
not-too-hidden advice in favour of migration. He says: “If death is
to be the lot in any case, courage becomes of no count; for man lives
but to escape death.”</p>

This  argument  seems  to  beg  the  question.  Man does   not live
but to escape death. If he does so, he is advised not to do so. He is
advised to learn to love death as well as life, if not more so. A

saying, harder to act up to, one may say. Every worthy act is
difficult. Ascent is always difficult. Descent is easy and often
slippery. Life becomes livable only to the extent that death is
treated as a friend, never as an enemy. To conquer life’s
temptations, summon death to your aid. In order to postpone death a
coward surrenders honour, wife, daughter and all. A courageous man
prefers death to  the surrender of self-respect. When the time comes,
as it conceivably can,  I would not leave my advice to be inferred,
but it will be given in precise language. That today my advice might
be followed only by one or none does not detract from its value. A
beginning is always made by a few, even one.</p>

This is a difficult question to answer in the present state  of
things. Almost every Muslim is a suspect in the Union and every Hindu
or Sikh likewise in Pakistan, West or East. If there is a hearty
invitation, I would advise joining the body, assuming of course that
the terms are equal and there is no interference with one’s
religion. If there is no such invitation, I should, for the time

	I was delighted to receive your letter of 18th ultimo. You
	unnecessarily fear that service for the good of humanity might, in
	my opinion, be less than prayer. <i>Laborare </i><i>est </i><i>prate,

	there may be no fear of clash of ideals between us, I warn you
	against taking the trouble of coming to India for the mere
	satisfaction of meeting me.</p>

	Much as I should love to see you and to hear from you how you could
	exist in the Himalayas without alcohol and meat, I must not yield to
	the temptation. Very often I have found the saying “Distance lends
	enchantment to the view” verified. Moreover at the present moment,
	we in India have been overtaken by unexpected insanity, which has
	turned many of us into cut-throats. If, however, you feel that you
	must come to India even apart from your desire to see me, you would
	be most welcome.</p>

Since I had no letter from you recently, I was beginning to be afraid
lest you had fallen sick. You must regularly take sun-bath and apply
mud-packs. Take complete rest and repeat Ramanama with eyes closed
till you fall asleep. Give up all anxiety regarding your sons or
other things. Don’t start taking milk yet. Take whey, as much hot
water as you can and some honey. Among fruits, avoid heavy ones like
bananas. You can take <i>mosambi, </i>orange or lemon; also raw
vegetables. Stop all walking and reading. Get someone to read  to 
you. Strictly avoid newspapers, because they publish all sorts of
true and false reports about  the  country  and  about  me,  which 
make  you anxious. Listen to newspaper reports only if you are  a
<i>sthitaprajna. </i>Listen to <i>Ramayana, Bhagawat, </i>the Bible,
etc. If you carry out these instructions, you will recover soon and
be in a position to share my work.</p>

Babo must be going to school. Let them all do their own work with
their own hands. That will make them self-reliant. I am keeping well.
The burden of work is heavy. Manu will be writing about all other
things. I am instructing Manu to write to you every week even if I am
not able to do so.</p>

poor child do? But it would prick me that I snatched away the rupee
from the poor child by beating him. Of course there are any number of
such rogues in the world. But I cannot do such a thing. I have no
right to deprive anyone like that. Snatching away something would
have a bad result. That is why I say that we cannot demand rights
with violence. There is only one way of securing our rights which I
have already explained.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Everybody approved of it. I have stated my view about
the rights of the people and how they can be achieved. I would say
that there is nothing like a right. For the one who has no duties
there are no rights either. In other words, all rights emanate from
duties—if there is no duty, there is no right either. When I do my
duty, it brings some result and that is my right. For instance, I eat
because it is my duty to do so. If I eat for pleasure, I fall victim
to some disease or other.If I eat because it is my duty to eat, if I
pray to God, if I serve the world, that itself is my right. What is
my right? It is the right to serve. You would ask me how that can be
called a right. But you would understand this if you thought over it
a little. I would say that that itself becomes the right. Suppose I
work for the whole day and earn eight annas—I get those eight annas
as my right. How did I have that right? Because I worked. If I do not
work and take eight annas, I appropriate that amount, I do not have
it as my right. I can have a right only when I fulfil my promise to
work and that too sincerely in thought, word and deed. But if I do
not work with my heart in it, if I exploit the employer and deceive
him because he is not noticing it, then it is a sin. When I know that
everybody is getting a rupee I too want to have a rupee for myself.
But when can I have it? Only when I have the employer’s permission.
I would ask him why,  when everybody is getting one rupee, I should
work for eight annas only, and would ask for at least fifteen annas.
He may say that I should work for eight annas or leave. What should I
do in that case? Should I burn his property? Obstruct his work? Do
picketing? Go on fast? If I say that I would resign but not work for
eight annas, then I would be acting like a gentleman. I would say
that whatever you do, you must do in a decent way. Decency means
following one’s religion, doing one’s duty and earning one’s
rights non-violently by performing</p>

I have already talked to you about the Christians. Today I will tell
you about the Harijans. It is a matter of shame for us that there are
Harijans in Rohtak, or, say, in Rohtak district—they were there
everywhere before and are still there. There are the Jats and perhaps
Ahirs too. They felt that the Harijans were their slaves and they
could get any work done by them. Once again the question of their
rights came and they felt that the Harijans were born slaves. They
may be given water and food but they can get nothing by right. I
regard this as arrogance. This was prevalent during the days of the
British and now it is all the more there. These poor Harijans are
timid, so they came to me and asked me what they should do in the
face of harassment. Should they remain slaves or die or leave Rohtak?
It is quite understandable that they cannot leave the place. If they
leave Rohtak,other people would suffer, because their work would be
affected. But this means that Harijans have to remain slaves forever.
And so, those poor people came. Some of them study in schools, some
are studying further and some lag behind; some even learn crafts, but
what can they tell those who are harassing them? We have now reached
a stage when we do not stop to think where we are going. During the
British days we used to be afraid of being beaten or killed. Now that
the alien rule has ended we think that no one can do us any harm. We
feel that we can even intimidate a judge if we are brought before
him. We think that the judge can do nothing to us. We have become so
arrogant. The result is that the Harijans are ruined. So, I suggested
to them that they should go to Thakkar Bapa<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. He was born just to serve the Harijans and the
tribals. He does everything for the Harijans. So those people went to
him and came back to tell me that he was not doing anything for them.
I knew what they wanted. They are seated right here. I told them that
they should go to Dr. Gopichand<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

attend to every work of the Harijan Sevak Sangh at  one  time.  I
decided to meet him since he was coming here today, and I met him.
But what can be done when the people there have  become  such
tyrants, resort to coercion and refuse to listen? The British rule is
no longer there, and the people cannot behave like that.  Then  what
should the Harijans do? So, I thought that today I should talk about
the sad plight of the Harijans. Can we not do even this much? What is
our duty today? So far we have acted against dharma in regarding the
Harijans as untouchables and slaves. We committed that mistake, that
sin,  and   the   Harijan   Sevak   Sangh   came   into   being<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
     </font></sup>by   way  of expiation.   The   Sangh   has   done 
 considerable   work.   But   not  all Hindus have taken the same
stand. Millions of Hindus have not even accepted the Sangh. If all
Hindus had accepted it, where was the need for me to narrate this sad
tale? During the days of the British we used to abuse them and say
that we would become good if the British did not rule us. Now the
British have gone. But have  we become good or bad? I would say that
there is more degeneration now than before. We used to commit
excesses and are committing them even now. First we oppressed the
Muslims. This too was a sin. Forget that Pakistan has come into
being, don’t think of it. If one man commits a sin should we also
do the same? You will realize that it is bad if you think over it.
One wrong leads to another. We have killed a large number of people.
We have acquired false courage and we are determined to kill the
Christians, and then we want to have Jatistan, Ahiristan and so many
separate states. But no one is keen about building up India. We must
accept the Harijans. They too are Hindus like us. They are not the
fifth caste. Hinduism has no fifth <i>varna; </i>there are only four,
and these four <i>varnas </i>are not graded as high or low. Among
these four <i>varnas </i>the first teaches religion, the second
protects people, the third practises trade— to  collect  millions 
of rupees, not for personal use but for the welfare of the
people—-and the fourth serves the society. But people belonging to
the four <i>varnas </i>can mingle with one another. It is not as
though a Shudra, if he became a barrister, could not practise law. He
can serve even after becoming a barrister. One who teaches religion
serves, so does the one who practises trade and is in employment and
also the one who</p>

sweeps. All these four are fields of service. The one who teaches
religion has to learn more. But that does not mean that he commits a
sin by giving up his profession and going in for another. It is not
that he cannot do that. Similarly, we created so many castes and now
are creating the fifth <i>varna. </i>This is wrong, it is an act of
wickedness. Everything will be all right if each follows his
religion. Now, when we are having the reins of power in our hands, it
seems to me that things would be all right if the Hindus and the
Sikhs followed their respective religions. I have finished for the

You are good enough, when I enter the prayer-ground, to make ample
room for me and my daughters to allow us to pass through. I would
urge you to observe the same orderliness when after the prayer I go
out. There is an unseemly rush to touch me as I pass. The crowd press
in upon me. I know and value your affection. I want it to take the
shape not of effusiveness but of some constructive service of the
country such as I have pointed out on many an occasion and in my
numerous writings. The first and foremost today is communal harmony.
Formerly the discord was of a negative character. Today it is of a
most virulent type. The Hindus and the Sikhs on the one hand and the
Muslims on the other have become enemies of each other with the
shameful results which we have already seen.</p>

Take the latest tragedy that took place in the heart of the capital
city yesterday. Some Hindu and Sikh refugees are reported to have
gone out to an empty Muslim house and unlawfully attempted to occupy
it. A scuffle ensued and some were injured, though none fatally. This
incident, bad as it was, was exaggerated out of all proportion. The
first report was that four Sikhs were murdered. The sequel was to be
expected. Retribution followed and several stabbings took place. A
new technique seems to have been established now. The Sikhs with
drawn swords, which seem to have taken the place of little <i>kirpans
</i>, with or without the Hindus, visit Muslim houses and demand
evacuation. This is a monstrous state of things in this, the capital
city, if the report is true. If it is untrue, it may be dismissed. If
it is true, it demands urgent attention not only from the authorities
but the public as well. The former will be impotent, if the public is
not behind them.</p>

I am not sure what my duty is in this case. Things are evidently
going from bad to worse. The full moon day of <i>Kartik </i>will soon
be upon us. All kinds of rumours have been pouring in. I hope that
they are all untrue, as they proved to be for the Dussehra and the
Bakr-Id.</p>

One lesson to be learnt from these rumours is that we are living a
disturbed life, which is not good for any State or nation. Every
servant of the nation has to consider seriously the part he has to
play towards the abatement of this corroding nuisance.</p>

It is well to consider at this stage a long letter from Sardar Sant
Singh of Lyallpur, former M. L. A. (Central). He has put up a
forcible defence for the Sikhs. He has read into my prayer speech<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
 last Wednesday a meaning which the words do not bear and certainly
never meant by me. Perhaps the good Sardar does know of my intimate
connection with the Sikhs ever since my return from South Africa in
1915. There was a time when my word was law to them as to the Hindus
and the Muslims. Manners have changed with the times. But I know that
I have not. The Sardar, perhaps, does not view the present tendency
among the Sikhs as I, their avowed, dispassionate friend without any
axe of my own to grind, can and do. I speak freely</p>

and frankly because I am their true friend. I make bold to say that
many a time the Sikh situation was saved because the Sikhs in general
chose to follow my advice. I need, therefore, no reminder  that  I 
should be cautious about what I say about the Sikhs or any other
community. Let the Sardar and every Sikh, who wishes well by them and
is not carried away by the prevailing current, help in ridding the
great and brave community of madness, drunkenness and all the vices
that flow from it. Let them sheathe the sword which they have
flourished loudly and used badly. Let them not be fooled by the Privy
Council judgement if it means that the <i>kirpan </i>is a sword  of 
any length. A <i>kirpan </i>ceases to be sacred when it goes into the
hands of an unprincipled drunkard or when it is used anyhow. A sacred
thing has to be used on sacred and lawful occasions. A <i>kirpan </i><i>is
</i>undoubtedly a symbol of strength, which adorns the possessor only
if he exercises amazing restraint over himself and uses it against
enormous odds against himself.</p>

The Sardar will pardon me when I say that I have fairly studied the
history of the Sikhs and drunk deep of the essence of the
<i>Granthsaheb. </i>Tested by the tenets of that scripture, what is
said to have been done by the Sikhs is indefensible and suicidal. The
Sikh bravery and integrity must not be frittered away on any account.
It can be an asset to the whole of India. In my opinion, it is a
menace which it should not be.</p>

Of course, it is nonsense to suggest that the Sikhs are enemy No. 1
of Islam. Have I not been described as such? Is the honour to be
divided between them and me? I have never desired the honour. My
whole life is a standing testimony against the charge. Can the same
be said of the Sikhs? Let them learn the lesson from the Sikhs who
stand behind the Sher-e-Kashmir<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

I know the vicious suggestion that the Hindus would be all right if
they would sacrifice the Sikhs who would never be tolerated in
Pakistan. I can never be a party to any such fratricidal bargain.
There can be no rest for this unhappy land unless every Hindu and

I must not be asked to recount the evil deeds of Pakistan. The
recounting won’t help either the Hindu or the Sikh sufferers.
Pakistan has to bear the burden of its sins, which I know are
terrible enough. It should be enough for everybody to know my opinion
(in so far as it has any value) that the beginning was made by the
Muslim League long before the 15th of August. Nor am I able to say
that they turned over a new leaf on the 15th of August last. This
statement of my opinion can’t help you. What is of moment is that
we of the Union copied the sins and thus became fellow-sinners. Odds
became even. Shall we now awake from the trance, repent and change or
must we fall?</p>

I think it would be good if institutions like the Nayee Talim<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>, Ashram, etc., get integrated. There will be
substantial savings also. The atmosphere will definitely undergo a
sea-change. But all these aspects have to be considered by the Ashram
inmates themselves. I see no early prospect of my going there. God
will either save me or consume me here. Whatever the result I am
patiently waiting for either of the two. And I look upon this as
God’s grace.</p>

In my view, the Junagadh problem remains unsolved. If the Nawab had
not run away and if he had handed over all power voluntarily, that
would have constituted real victory. He ran away because he was
afraid of you. I do not consider this a glorious achievement. What I
wanted was that the Nawab should have stayed and done the will of his
subjects. He could not become a servant of the people. This is
possible only in a non-violent struggle. A mighty power like England
was subdued by a struggle based on truth and non-violence and it
transferred all power with its own hands. We have</p>

	Today I want to tell you something about the refugees from Pakistan.
	But the difficulty is whether they should be called refugees. Some
	persons met me yesterday and asked me why I was referring to them as
	refugees. In a way they are right because those who seek shelter are
	known as <i>sharanarthi—</i>refugees. They said they had been
	driven here by their troubles, but why should they seek anybody’s
	protection here, especially since they have come to India and India
	belongs to everyone? I think of Pakistan as also included in India.
	But if it is not part of India today and India is divided into two
	parts, the Indian Union belongs and should belong to everybody. So,
	when they come over here, they do so as a matter of right. From this
	point of view those persons’ remark appeared right to me. When a
	person is facing hardships in a place and escapes from that place
	and comes and takes shelter on the lap of his mother, shall we call
	him a refugee or a person who has come as a matter of right? I told
	them that they must admit that I had no ill feeling in my heart
	which would make me use harsh words. In fact, we have been such
	slaves of the English language that we cannot free ourselves from
	that slavish mentality. Hence the word refugee, and it could mean
	only one thing, as popularized by the Press, namely, <i>sharanarthi
	</i>or <i>nirashrit. </i>Then those people remarked that there were
	many other words in English. Why should they not be called
	‘sufferers’. I know English sufficiently well. So, how could I
	call them sufferers? Then, what should I call them? I thought they
	may be called <i>dukhi </i>because they are disconsolate. But in a
	way, we are all full of sorrow in this life. As a matter of fact
	those who have come here in millions leaving their homes and
	property are in great misery. I would therefore like to talk about
	them today.</p>

	Three types of people came to see me today. One type I would leave
	out altogether. The person had a big joint family in Lahore. He used
	to run some hotels, etc., and all his houses and property were left
	behind and he came here with his wife and children. He did not bring
	all the family members here. He narrated everything to me and
	requested me to find some accommodation for him. I told him that I
	had no authority, and even if I had, I would not fix any</p>

accommodation for him. As it was, there was housing shortage in Delhi
and the local people themselves were in great trouble; the Government
requisitioned their houses. When an officer or a diplomat arrived, he
could not be put up in a tent. Hence, the Government acquired some
houses and made the allotment for the purpose. If the original
occupants protested and asked where they could go, they were asked to
go anywhere. The Government, of course, did not go to that extent,
but it could go, and many people would have received notices to
vacate their houses. Under these conditions, how could these millions
of suffering people be provided accommodation? He told me that he had
come here after losing seventeen members [of his family].  I told him
that at least he had seventeen members in his family. There were some
families where there was no one apart from a man and a woman. I told
him that if he believed that he belonged to the whole of India, even
after the loss of the seventeen members who were dead and gone, the
rest of India was there for him. Well, this is just philosophizing,
so let us leave it here. Then I told him that he should go and live
in the camps. All types of people were living there and there was
nothing wrong about it. He said that he was no beggar to live on
charity. I assured him he certainly was not one and if I were in
charge of the refugee camps, I would not give food on charity. I
would tell them that they were able-bodied and should work and
maintain themselves and weave their own cloth. I would of course tell
them to cover themselves during the night and protect themselves
against the dew. But they needed no covering during the day. The sky
was clear and they should take warmth from the heat of the sun. I did
not stay inside during the day. I enjoyed the sun outside. But he
said that he could not do that. He had young children with him and he
needed a house to live in. I asked him if he was the only person
having children. I found in every camp I visited mothers with their
children. Some women were pregnant and gave birth to their children
right there in the camps. What was his objection then to living in a
refugee camp? I said he should eat what other refugees were eating
and work as others did; he was strong and sturdy and might as well
run a hotel or something. Why then should he not do something which
might bring relief to others?</p>

He asked me: “Why should the Muslims living here not vacate their
houses and go away? Why are they still here?” I was deeply pained
to hear this. In the first place the Muslims are already running away
in panic and even from among those who have stayed back</p>

some are being slaughtered daily. Everyone goes and tells them: “Go
away, we want to live in your houses.” If everybody exercises
authority, who will be the subjects and to whom would the country
belong? Everybody cannot wield authority. Nowhere in the world things
happen like this. Of course, it is said that among the savages there
is no leader. But even bandits have a leader. In the case of Ali Baba
and the forty thieves there was at least one leader. Thus there is no
place in the world where all would be leaders or there would be no
leader at all. We, however, do not know how to wield power and how to
rule ourselves. That is the reason why we are in trouble today. It is
deplorable that you should have designs on the houses of the Muslims
who have fled in panic or have been killed or arrested by the police.
It does not befit you. If at all, you can say that to me because the
house in which I stay is like a palace. You can ask me to leave this
place and go and live in a camp. You can say that it would make no
difference to me, for I have no wife, no sons, no daughters, that I
have gathered these girls from somewhere and call them my daughters,
that I should go to the camps and regard all the girls there as my
daughters. I would listen to you if you said that to me. I would
certainly feel amused, for, even if I ran away, would you stay here?
This house belongs to someone else. It is not mine. Of course the
owner of this house has made me the owner and insisted that I should
keep or prevent anyone from staying here as I please. How can the
Muslims leave their houses? Only Gandhi is in a position to do that.
If he is removed from here and dumped somewhere no one is going to
leave him unattended. Somebody would give him milk, fruits, dates and
somehow his things would be managed. He is not going to remain

like this to that gentleman he felt ashamed.</p>

Then some Sikh gentlemen came to me. They said they were not like the
Sikhs here. The surprising thing was that they did not carry <i>kirpans.
</i>I did not ask them the reason. However, they did wear metal
wristlets on their wrists and I think they also had beards. They told
me they were in great distress. They belonged to the Hazara district
where they owned and tilled land. They were ready to live by farming
if they were provided land and implements. I was touched by what they
said and felt they were right. I asked them why they did not go to
East Punjab. They informed me that the East  Punjab  Government could
accommodate only people coming from West Punjab. They were told that
the Government could not accommodate</p>

people coming from every place. Since they belonged to the Frontier
Province they were asked to approach the Union Government.</p>

Even though the Central Government does not have land, it would be
nice if it could get land for these people. The Government should
arrange to get for them oxen, ploughs, seeds, etc. I do not know if
there is sufficient land in the province of Delhi. But those who want
to use the plough should be settled somewhere. Had I been in charge
of the Government, I would have set up a separate camp for them,
where they could produce their own requirements of food. If that is
not possible, let the Government give them loan to meet the expenses
of these things. These people say that they do not have any money
now, but they are industrious and if they could get facilities they
would produce everything and would not sit idle. It seems to me that
the country is losing much because such farmers are just sitting idle
in so many places. They are our brothers and we must do something for
them. I do not know whom I should approach in the Government. But
through you I want to make it known to the Government that it is our
duty to help such people. They ask me where they could go and stay
and how they could eat. I would say that there should be a separate
camp for them. But till that is arranged they should live and manage
their things in the camps that are already there. If they cannot be
given any place here, any vacant place anywhere in India is as good. 
They do not insist on being accommodated only here. They do not even
say that they should be allotted any Muslim house. They say that they
do not want to make others pass through the hardships they have
known. They say they are poor people. They are strong enough but
their strength is not for intimidating others. They want to live in
whatever way they can with fear of God in their hearts. I told them
that their trouble was only a passing phase. They wondered how that
could be—just as somebody here wonders—how it could happen that
the people who have come from Pakistan would go back there and the
Muslims who have run away to Pakistan would return here, as I have
been saying. I told them that it would happen, if not today, then
tomorrow. But the condition is that we on our side should become
good. Let us convince ourselves that there is none who is our enemy.
Even the Muslims are not our enemies. Some people say that even here
the Muslims are fifth-columnists. How could the poor things be fifth
columnists? Nobody can harass us here and if anyone dares to do so,
God will see to him or our Government will put him down. If we come
to our</p>

senses here today, everything will be well tomorrow; I too will be
free. Today I am very much disturbed. My life has become a burden to
me. I wonder why I am still here. I could become strong if Delhi were
restored to sanity, and then I would rush to West Punjab and tell the
Muslims who have gone away from here that I have prepared the ground
for them and they could come back any time they wanted and live
wherever they chose. Such an occasion is bound to come some time, for
how long can crores remain enemies of each other? It is not possible
to kill or drive away 350 to 400 million Muslims who are here in
India. One cannot even dream of it and I do not want to entertain any
such dream. But today I have become a sort of burden. There was a
time when my word was law. But it is no longer so. Should I run away
in that case? Whether I live or die, those who are living in misery
will certainly return to their homes with honour and respect, not in
order to pick up a fight with anyone but to meet their own brethren.
Similarly, the Muslims should come back here. That is the only thing
that can keep us alive and in no other way can we survive.</p>

A gentleman has written a letter to me. It is accompanied with a
cutting from a Bombay newspaper. It is stated in that cutting that
Gandhi is only carrying on propaganda for the Congress, but people
are not interested in hearing it. If the Congress uses the radio,
etc., like this for its own propaganda, it is bound to bring about
dictatorship in the end. It is absolutely incorrect  to  say  that  I
 sing  praises  of  the Congress I do not sing anybody’s praises
and, if I do, I sing the praises of the whole world. The cutting also
says that the talk of non-violence is just for show, the real purpose
being self-glorification by the Government. But I would say that no
government which indulges in self-glorification can survive. And I
only want to serve dharma. I speak to you only about things related
to dharma. Maybe, some people are not interested in hearing what I
say. But there are others who write to tell me that they feel greatly
encouraged by what I</p>

your mind is somewhere else, you are free to leave this place without

Many of our women are in Pakistan. They are being molested. Those
unfortunate women are made to feel ashamed. In my view, they have no
reason to feel ashamed. It would be gross injustice if any woman is
considered worthless by society and abandoned by her brothers,
parents, and husband because she had been abducted by the Muslims. It
is my belief that any woman who has the purity of Sita cannot be
touched by anyone. But where can we find women like Sita these days?
And not all women can be like Sita. Should we show contempt for the
woman who had been forcibly abducted and tyrannized? She is not a
woman of loose character. My daughter or wife too could be abducted
and raped. But I would not hate her for that reason. Many such women
had approached me in  Noakhali.  Many Muslim women also came. We have
all become goondas. I consoled those women. It is the men who commit
rape that should feel ashamed, not these poor women.</p>

farmers to help in harvesting and threshing and thus take the grains
to the house. That practice is now forgotten, but should be revived.
Nothing can be accomplished single-handed. That  friend  also
suggests that at least one of the Ministers should be a peasant.
Unfortunately, none of our Ministers is a peasant. The Sardar is a
peasant by birth and has some knowledge of agriculture, but he is a
barrister by profession. Jawaharlal is a scholar and a great writer,
but what does he know about farming? More than 80 per cent of our
population are peasants. In a true democracy, there should be the
rule of peasants in our country. They need not become barristers.

majority, and the Hindus and the Sikhs are just a handful. None the
less, he carries them all with him. He does nothing that would keep
them discontented. Then we saw that while coming here he also went to
Jammu. There have been considerable excesses by  the  Hindus there.
This has not been fully reported in the newspapers. The Maharaja  and
 his  new  Premier<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1     
</font></sup>also   went  there.   I   asked   Sheikh Abdullah
jokingly if there were two Premiers. He said he also was not aware of
it but this much he could say, that he was looking after the affairs
of the Government there, whether there were one or two Prime
Ministers. So he too went to Jammu. I do not know if what happened in
Jammu was at the instance of the Maharaja or his new Premier. But
those things happened there and it is a matter of great shame for us.
Still Sheikh Abdullah did not lose his balance and the Hindus in
Jammu fully supported him. Where then was the need to tell him
anything? But he has still to convince Kashmir and the entire India
that the only way for Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs is to live together
in amity and to trust one another. Then alone can Kashmir and India
live together. His attempts are no doubt in that direction, but there
is one obstruction. It is a mountain region which is at a height of
10,000 if not 14,000 feet. It snows heavily there. That is why
movement from one place to another is not very easy. The movement
would be easy only through Pakistan. But who could say that Pakistan
would allow the movement? Apart from that, fighting is already going
on with the Afridi invaders who may well be said to belong to
Pakistan. Under these circumstances, how can the Kashmiris come <i>via
</i>Pakistan? The Government of the Indian Union has already sent
help to them and they can have a straight road only through India.
There is not much of trade in Kashmir, but the people of Kashmir are
industrious and skilled in handicrafts. Kashmir is a huge fruit
garden. But who would bring all those things from there and how?
Everything cannot be brought by air. And how can those vendors travel
by air? That is not possible. So, the only way is through Pathankot
in East Punjab. It is a small road but at least there is one. But the
Hindus of East Punjab have become so bad that no Muslim can cross
that road. The Sheikh says that that is the greatest danger. He is a
very big man but he says that even for him it is difficult to pass
through that way. Not only the</p>

So the Governor-General and these four have met. It would be well if
they are able to do something. And they have done some little bit.
But what is the use of their doing anything? If the people themselves
are caught in a frenzy, then nothing can be done. I would tell the
people of East Punjab that enough damage had been done, and now let
us forget everything. Or, would things always be like this? I would
say that that road should be absolutely clear. The Government also
should fully carry out its responsibility. If the Government is not
able to do this, what is the use of our having sent the army by air?
Will it help in carrying on trade in Kashmir? If not, is the Indian
Union going to feed the Kashmiris? That is not possible. If today our
Government has come to possess millions of rupees, would it go on
squandering that money? I hear that every officer in the Government
is going to have a secretary. I just do not know what he would do or
what monthly salary he would get. If we go on squandering money at
this rate, we will perish in no time. Ours is not a land of
millionaires. It  is a poor country where people earn even a few
copper coins with great difficulty. There are only a handful of
millionaires or businessmen. And how much money do even these people
have? If it is squandered like this, it will all be spent in no time.
Then there is the whole country to be looked after. We cannot waste
money like that. So the Government will have to see how that road can
be made safe so that anybody can pass on safely. Kashmiris make
beautiful clothes which can be brought by that road. Shawls and other
handicrafts can also be brought. So also the Kashmir dry fruits.
Today you can get a Kashmir apple with great difficulty. Kashmir has
acceded to  the  Indian Union, but how long can it remain with India
in this way? If Kashmir does not find a safe thoroughfare, I do not
know what would happen. Now, after mentioning the third point, I will
wind up for the day.</p>

<i>the </i><i>Bombay Chronicle, </i>can’t they? So this is a
useless argument. I think the <i>Dawn </i>and the <i>Pakistan Times
</i>are also good papers which are read by Muslims and run by leading
Muslims. They write about the Muslims of Kathiawar in their papers.
When the Sardar went to Junagadh I was happy to see that even the
Muslims had welcomed him there. They said it was good he went there
because they were in great trouble. When the Princes and the people
of Kathiawar are all on one side, how long could Junagadh remain
apart? Hence, I was happy that the whole problem was solved without
any violence. They did not remain strictly non-violent, but whatever
violence they used was after great thought and consideration. I was
very happy to know all that. But now I hear and even the <i>Dawn
</i>expresses the view that the Muslims in Kathiawar cannot live in
peace. I have received a telegram from a Muslim at the right moment.
Kathiawar is a region where the Muslims used to live in peace and
nobody ever disturbed them. There were good Muslims there and also
rebellious Muslims. They  did  not  quarrel with one another, but
struggled for livelihood. Now, in that same Kathiawar such a
situation has developed that they wonder if they can live there at
all. In such a situation, should all Muslims in Kathiawar run away or
should the Hindus slaughter them all? They are terribly harassed, and
for me, this is unbearable because I was born in Kathiawar, and I
know all the Princes and thousands of people there. Shamaldas Gandhi,
who is like a son to me, has become all in all there. He has also
formed a Provisional Government there. What is the use of that
Provisional Government if, in spite of it, innocent Muslims are
killed? When people thus take the law into their own hands, how can
the Muslims feel safe there? I cannot say what will happen if this
state of affairs spreads to all other places. I do not know if all
those things actually happened there, but I have read the report in
the <i>Dawn </i>and have also received some telegrams. Later I asked
some Hindus about it, and they said that there had been some cases of
arson and loot, but they could not say if there were any cases of
murder or abduction of Muslim women. But the <i>Dawn </i>reports that
all the four things happened and that too on a wide scale. I had
received several telegrams but only one telegram was shown to me and
by mistake the others were not shown. Perhaps some fifty telegrams
would have come to me from Muslims at different places. And they have
a right to tell me that my son has become all-powerful there. But how
can I take the responsibility for everything that my son may do? At
the same time, how can I convince the world or the Muslims that way?
What they</p>

write is true. But when could I have conveyed my feelings to my son? 
I read about it only today. Hence, through you I wish to convey not
only to my son but to the whole of Kathiawar that if the Hindus have
become so bad—they can be only Hindus because there are no Sikhs
living there except perhaps some who might have settled there to earn
their livelihood—then Kathiawar cannot remain undivided. We have
taken Junagadh, no doubt, but we have done it in such a way that we
are going to lose it—just as we won our freedom but to lose it.
Then they remind me of what the Sardar had said in Junagadh. He had
said that nobody would touch even a Muslim child provided he was
loyal to Kathiawar, that is, the whole of India. He said he would see
how anyone could even touch a young Muslim girl. He could say that
because he is at once the Sardar and the Home Minister of India. He
had a right to say that. But after his saying it, what has happened?
It pains me to see that such things could happen in  Kathiawar  and
people could become so mad. We have lost our dharma, our ability to
work, and in this way we are going to lose our country. It was my
duty to put all these things before you. These things are not
reported in our newspapers. But I get all the news. It was of course
my duty to make inquiries, but where do I have time for it? Hence, I
have told you what I have heard. Even when I met Liaquat Ali I told
him that I would like to ask him a question if he permitted. He
agreed. Then I asked him if he was aware of what was happening in
Kathiawar. He said he knew everything—that such things had happened
and all the four things had taken place—but he could not say on
what scale. He is the Prime Minister of Pakistan. That is why he
openly told me everything, whereas I was talking with great
restraint. Then I thought I would convey to you this evening how
pained I am by all this.</p>

Kathiawar is my home. When that very home is on fire, what chance do
I have to say anything? What can I say to the residents of Delhi?
Something or the other is always happening everywhere around me. How
can I remain unmoved in such a situation? No sensible human being can
remain unmoved in such an atmosphere. This is my sad tale, rather,
the sad tale of the whole of India, that I have placed before you.</p>

A friend asked me the other day whether I shared the opinion often
expressed that as between nationalism and religion, the former was
superior to the latter. I said that the two were dissimilars and that
there could be no comparison between dissimilars. Each was equal to
the other in its own place. No man who values his religion as also
his nationalism can barter away the one for the other. Both are
equally dear to him. He renders unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s
and unto God that which is God’s. And if Caesar, forgetting his
limits, oversteps them, a man of God does not transfer his loyalty to
another Caesar, but knows how to deal with the usurpation. A
rehearsal of this difficulty gave rise to satyagraha.</p>

Take a homely illustration. Suppose I have mother, wife and daughter.
All the three must be equally dear to me in their own places. It is a
vulgar error to think that a man is entitled to forsake his mother
and his daughter for the sake of his wife. He dare not do the
converse. And if any of the three oversteps her limits, the law of
satyagraha comes to his assistance for the restoration of the
equilibrium of the three forces.</p>

I fear that I might not be able to say all that I want to. I had also
hoped that you, having gone through the military machine, would
observe perfect silence. But the discipline has not reached the
sisters and, therefore, they are not able to observe the laws of
public meetings. I had the same experience when, some years ago, I
was in Amritsar. You will admit that the fault lies with the men. As
I entered the meeting place I saw the remains of bananas and oranges
thrown about anyhow. These have not only made the place dirty,  but
dangerous to walk. We should learn to keep the roads and footpaths as
clean as the floors in our houses. In the absence of proper
receptacles  I have noticed disciplined people putting these in a
piece of paper and then temporarily in their pockets until they are
cast in their places. It is the duty of men, if they have learnt the
rules of social conduct, to teach them to the womenfolk.</p>

Today Baba Bachittar Singh came to me in the morning and insisted
that I should attend the Guru Nanak birthday celebrations. He told me
that probably over a lakh of men and women had assembled there, and
that most of them would be sufferers from West Pakistan. I hesitated
because I felt that many Sikhs had been displeased with me. The  Baba
 nevertheless  insisted  and  said  that  I   should   say   my say
before the meeting. I yielded and felt that even as a mother often
gives bitter pills to her children, I would take the liberty of
saying things, which might appear to be bitter. In reality and in
effect they are meant for your good. My mother often used to
administer bitter drugs, but I could not feel elsewhere the comfort
that her lap provided for me. Whatever I have said to you up to now,
I do not regret. I have said those things as your sincere friend and
servant. I have with me Sardar Datar Singh’s daughter. You perhaps
know him. He has lost his all in the Punjab. He was the owner of
large tracts of land and several hundred fine cattle. He has lost
many relatives and dear friends in Montgomery, but I am glad to be
able to tell you that he has not shed  a single tear over the
misfortune, nor has he felt any bitterness towards the Muslims. I
would like you to follow his example. Sikh friends have told me that
one Sikh is considered equal to 1,25,000 men. Where is that bravery
today? Have things come to such a pass that a</p>

I am free to admit that the mischief commenced in Pakistan, but the
Hindus and the Sikhs of East Punjab and  the  neighbouring districts
have not been behindhand in copying the mischief. The difference is
that the Hindus have not the courage of the Sikhs, who know how to
use the sword.</p>

You see Sheikh Abdullah with me. I was disinclined to bring him with
me, for I know there is a great gulf between the Hindus and the Sikhs
on the one side and the Muslims on the other. But the Sheikh, known
as the Lion of Kashmir, although a pucka Muslim, has won the hearts
of both by making them forget that there is any difference between
the three. He had not been embittered. Even though in Jammu recently
the Muslims were killed by the Hindus and the Sikhs, he went to Jammu
and invited the evil-doers to forget the past and repent over the
evil they had done. The Hindus and the Sikhs of Jammu listened to
him. Now the Muslims and the Hindus and the Sikhs of Kashmir and
Jammu are fighting together to defend the beautiful valley of
Kashmir. I am glad, therefore, that you  are  receiving the two of us
with cordiality.</p>

Let this auspicious day mark the beginning of a new chapter in your
life. Let the disgrace of driving out the Muslims from Delhi cease
from today. I found to my shame that as our motorcar was passing
through Chandni Chowk, which used to be filled with Hindus, Sikhs and
Muslims, I did not notice a single Muslim passer-by. Surely we have
not come to such a pass as to be afraid of the minority of the
Muslims scattered throughout the Indian Union. If there are any
traitors in their midst, our Government is strong enough to deal with
them. We must be ashamed of hurting children, women or old men. Every
man must be considered innocent before he is found guilty by a
properly constituted court of law.</p>

You know that today is Guru Nanak’s birthday. Someone had sent an
invitation to me also but at that time I had told him that I should
be excused. But today Baba Bachittar Singh came to me and insisted
that I should go. He came to me at 10 o’clock and we had to go in
an hour’s time. I then decided that I should go. Although I have
done nothing from my side, my Sikh friends are angry with me today.
Of course I have tried to push a bitter pill down their throat. But
that is how things go on in the world. The Baba insisted on my going
there all the same. He said there must be thousands of Sikh men and
women and—some of them must be really in distress—who are eager
to hear me. I agreed and told him that he should take me with him at
11 o’clock. He came at 11 a.m. with Sheikh Abdullah. He was also to
be taken there. I asked him how Sheikh Abdullah could come there
since the Sikhs and the Muslims could not bear to look at one
another. But he said that Sheikh Abdullah had done one great thing.
He had kept the Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims united in Kashmir and
created a situation in which they would wish to live and die
together. So I thought that Sheikh Abdullah too should go with us,
and we took him along. I was very glad about it. There were thousands
of Sikh men and women. I spoke but little; but Sheikh Abdullah spoke
fairly at length, and people heard him with attention. There was no
trace of disapproval even in their eyes, then where was the question
of their creating noise? After all, we had been invited there. And
then the Sikhs are a brave community, so it all turned out well. I
felt I should pass on this little information to you.</p>

I have received a letter from Bengal. It is from the Muslim Chamber
of Commerce. I cannot reply to that letter; but I  have thought about
it and also enquired from Ghanshyamdas if he knew anything about it.
He told me that the Muslim Chamber of Commerce wants to have dealings
with the Government and wants to correspond with it. But the
Government belongs to everyone, whether he  be  Hindu, Muslim or
Parsi. Then, how can the Muslims, Hindus, Parsis and the Englishmen
have separate Chambers of Commerce? Hence the Government has refused
to recognize it. That gentleman says in his letter that it is indeed
strange that while the Marwari and the European Chambers of Commerce
are allowed to exist, only the Muslim Chamber is not being granted
the permission. I could appreciate his point and it pained me. If the
Government does not wish to have any dealings with the Muslim Chamber
of Commerce, it cannot have anything to do with the Marwari Chamber
of Commerce and should not have anything to do with the European
Chamber of Commerce, either. All these existed till now and the 
European Chamber of Commerce came into being because Europeans were
in power and since we were being ruled by them the Viceroy used to be
its President. And since he had to go to Calcutta during Christmas,
he used to deliver long speeches there. But now that practice cannot
be continued. How can the Europeans, Muslims and Marwaris have
separate Chambers of Commerce? There can be only one Indian Chamber
of Commerce. If the Hindus, Muslims and Parsis start having their
separate Chambers of Commerce, what is the use of India’s
independence? Especially the Europeans should yield now. They should
not do anything by remaining in isolation. They should refuse to have
any special privileges, and insist on having the same rights as
others. That would become a great hallmark of India’s independence.
The European Chamber of Commerce used to invite  the  Viceroy every
year. But, in my view, they cannot invite our Prime Minister or
Deputy Prime Minister or even Lord Mountbatten. Lord Mountbatten can
certainly go and meet them as a European. But the Chamber as such
cannot invite him. I am a small man, but I have no doubt about my
opinion. Similarly, the Marwari Chamber of Commerce cannot invite
anybody from the Government. It can invite anyone as a Marwari, but
not on behalf of the Chamber. They all exist because India exists.
Even the Muslims cannot live here as a separate community. Let them
live here as Indians. In the same manner, all Sikhs, Hindus and
Europeans can live here only as Indians. They can</p>

all stay here as loyal citizens of India, and in no other capacity.
Hence  I thought that I should convey to them this important point.
It is better that they hear my voice before they receive what I write
from here. If the Muslims insist on having a separate existence
politically and otherwise, then that wish cannot be granted. The
Europeans can live here as Christians and practise the wonderful
things in Christianity. This, after all, is their social or religious
sphere. But as far as administration and politics are concerned, they
must all be treated on an equal basis. Similarly, trade also belongs
to everybody. If the Marwaris, Gujaratis, Punjabis want to have their
exclusive shares, what would remain for India? We cannot carry on our
work in this manner.</p>

I forgot to mention one thing, which I should not have forgotten. I
had mentioned it at the meeting of the Sikhs. But here too there are
Sikhs and also Hindus. And what applies to one also applies to the
other. Then I would say that we must regard today as the New Year day
for the Sikhs. Hence, from today, the Sikhs have a duty  to  consider
all the rest as their brethren. Guru Nanak taught no other thing. He
even went to Mecca and has written quite a lot [about communal
harmony]. There are many such references in the <i>Guru </i><i>Granthsaheb.
</i>What did Guru Govind do? Many Muslims were his disciples and he
even killed some people to accommodate them and protect them. He
never killed anyone just for the sake of saving a Sikh. He did wield
the sword, but he had accepted certain restrictions for its use.
Thus, the Muslims may have done anything, but we do not have to
imitate them. Let us all remain good and do our duty. When I went to
address the meeting of the Sikhs today, I was pained that I did not
find a single Muslim on the road. What would be more shameful for us
than the fact that not a single Muslim could be found in  Chandni
Chowk? I found the area crowded with men and unending rows of cars.
But there was no Muslim among them. The only Muslim, Sheikh Abdullah,
was seated next to me. How can we succeed in these circumstances?</p>

the Sardar if that was hue. He said that that was not possible so
long as he was alive. He said not a single pie could be taken out
from the treasury of Junagadh for the renovation of the Somnath
temple. If he was not going to do it, he said, what could poor
Shamaldas do alone? There were enough number of Hindus who could
donate money for the Somnath temple. If they became miserly and did
not part with money, let the temple remain in its present state.
There were already a lakh and a half rupees and Jamsaheb had already
given a lakh. They would be able to manage for more.</p>

I have learnt one thing more. You must have known that the Muslims in
Pakistan have abducted our young girls. Attempts are being made and
must be made to rescue them. Let us  try  to  get  back every
abducted girl who is still alive there. If these girls have been
raped, have they lost everything by it? At least, I do not think so.
I had even talked about it yesterday. Coercion cannot make one change
his religion. But I hear that there is some talk of making some
payment to reclaim these girls. Some hoodlums come  forward  to bring
back the girls if they are paid Rs. 1,000 per girl. Has this thing
become a business then? If somebody kidnapped one of these three
girls with me and then demanded at least a hundred if not a thousand
rupees, I would tell him that he had better kill the girl. My
daughter would return if God wished to save her. Why should he
bargain with me for her? Not only did he abduct the girl but he also
indulged in bullying. Having abandoned his own religion he had come
to bully me because she was my daughter. I would refuse to give him
even a cowrie. Similarly no parent should make such bargains for his
daughter. They must think that their daughters are with God and God
is everywhere. If a girl loses her husband, where would she go? It is
of course a different matter if the girl wants to come over from
there and we give her the fare if she does not have it. But if a
hoodlum comes</p>

and demands ransom money, his demand just cannot be accepted. I give
such instances from there and also from here, because on our side too
we have done such things and abducted Muslim girls. Would our
Government indulge in such meanness? Should the East Punjab
Government or the Union Government ask Jinnah Saheb to pay one lakh
rupees for the return of Muslim girls in its custody? I would not
give a single cowrie to the Government. How could it demand money as
a reward for such abominable deeds? The Government  should admit its
mistake, make a solemn promise never to repeat it and return the girl
along with a compensation. We are not going to achieve anything if we
ourselves do not become pure and brave.</p>

I had discussed Kathiawar yesterday. I told you whatever I had read
in the Pakistani newspapers and subsequently heard from some Hindus.
But today I consulted the Sardar when he came to me. I told him that
when he went there he had made big speeches assuring that no one
would touch a single Muslim boy or girl there, but then I heard that
Muslims were being looted and beaten up, their property was burnt and
their young girls kidnapped. He said that as far as he was aware,
certainly not a single Muslim was killed nor a  single Muslim house
looted or burnt. All these things happened there in the chaos
prevailing before he visited the place. There were some cases of
looting and probably one house was burnt. But as for killing and
abducting, these two things did not take place there even then. An
agent of the central Government or some Commissioner was always
present there. He had been ordered to see that such things were not
allowed. He had been instructed to have perfect bandobast so that
nobody even touched any Muslim, let alone robbing or killing.
Subsequently, no such thing happened. I asked the Sardar if I could
mention the thing in the prayer meeting in the evening. He said I
could certainly do so. He said that if something had happened there,
he would have pursued the matter. He also said that the Hindu
Congressmen there at great risk to their lives saved the Muslims and
their property. No hooliganism could persist there. The Sardar said
that as long as he was there and was in charge of the Home
Department, he would not allow such a thing to happen. I was very
happy to hear all that and asked his permission to refer to it in
public. He said that I could gladly do so and also mention his name.
I was so happy that yesterday I had talked about it and today itself
I got this information.</p>

	I was so glad to receive your argued letter of 27th August. I see
	that you have grasped the fundamental difference between passive
	resistance and non-violent resistance. Resistance both forms are,
	but you have to pay a very heavy price when your resistance is
	passive, in the sense of the weakness of the resister. Europe
	mistook the bold and brave resistance full of wisdom by Jesus of
	Nazareth for passive resistance, as if it was of the weak. As I read
	the New Testament for the first time I detected no passivity, no
	weakness about Jesus as depicted in   the   four   gospels   and   
	the    meaning    became    clearer    to me when I read Tolstoy’s
	<i>Harmony </i><i>of the Gospels </i>and his other kindred writings.
	Has not the West paid heavily in regarding Jesus as a passive
	resister? Christendom has been responsible for the wars which put to
	shame even those described in the Old Testament and other records,
	historical or semi-historical. I know that I speak under correction
	for I can but claim very superficial knowledge of history— modern
	or ancient.</p>

	Coming to my own personal experience, whilst we undoubtedly got
	through passive resistance our political freedom, over which lovers
	of   peace   like   you   and   your   good   husband<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
	      </font></sup>of   the   West   are enthusiastic, we are daily
	paying the heavy price for the unconscious mistake we made or,
	better still, I made in mistaking passive resistance for non-violent
	resistance. Had I not made the mistake, we would have been spared
	the humiliating spectacle of a weak brother killing his weak brother
	thoughtlessly and inhumanly.</p>

I must confess that this is hoping against hope, for we are today
swearing by the military and all that naked physical force implies.
Our statesmen have for over two generations declaimed against the
heavy expenditure on armaments under the British regime, but now that
freedom from political serfdom has come, our military expenditure has
increased and still threatens to increase and of this we are proud!
There is not a voice raised against it in our legislative chambers.
In spite, however, of the madness and the vain imitation of the
tinsel of the West, the hope lingers in me and many others that India
shall survive this death dance and occupy the moral height that
should belong to her after the training, however imperfect, in
non-violence, for an unbroken period of 32 years since 1915.</p>

	You have asked for a message for the “Majoor Din”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

	assimilated the teaching of ahimsa, there should be no division of
	Hindus and Muslims among them and no trace of untouchability among
	the Hindu workers. Why should there be any divisions among workers?
	If the worker wants equality with the owner, he should look upon the
	mill as his own property and protect it. The Ahmedabad workers have
	already learnt how to fight injustice. But they have many more
	lessons to learn before they can hope to become partners with the
	original owners of the mills. Do they know this? Let them remember

	I told you yesterday that it was a day of momentous importance for
	the Sikhs. It should hold the same importance for us too. If they
	have truly started a new life and desire to follow the principles
	laid down by Guru Nanak for all of us, then Delhi should not be in
	the grip of the things that it is in at present.</p>

	I have read in the newspapers and also heard otherwise that a large
	number of people in Delhi are given to drinking. We already know the
	things people can do under the influence of alcohol. Now I am told
	that drinking has become a difficult problem and has spread over the
	entire city, so much so that it has become extremely difficult to
	control it. If a new chapter has started from yesterday liquor
	consumption should become even less than before. Alcohol can only
	make us mad. Why then be a slave to it? How can I tell you every-
	thing? All kinds of things are brought to my notice.</p>

	This is one thing. As for the other, I am told that the mosques
	which we had damaged are still in that state, and the mosques which
	were turned into temples are closed since the police or the military
	guards them. But even this hurts me. For how can such a thing be
	allowed if we have opened a new chapter from yesterday? The Sikhs
	could not have converted the mosques into temples. The Sikhs are a
	great community, and, if they decide to remain pure from today and
	do only pure deeds I have no doubt that it is bound to influence the
	Hindus. Then the Sikhs would become propagators of truth and
	justice. This would become their profession, i. e., to stand for
	peace and nothing but peace everywhere. If this happens, the very
	face of the country would change. Hence, those who have converted
	the mosques into temples should promptly remove the idols from
	there, and restore the mosques. In that event, what need would there
	be for the police or the military guarding those places? When all
	people become good, there need be no police.</p>

taken. I had said yesterday that we should not give even a cowrie to
get back the abducted girls. Those who have committed the crime of
abducting our girls should restore them to us, and also do penance at
the same time. It would not do to give any money to claim the girls
back. But there is a very alarming report. It is reported that in the
East Punjab we are ill-treating the Muslim girls, whom we have
forcibly kept. I just cannot understand how we could have stooped so
low. I must admit that I cannot bear to see this. We should regard
those girls as our mothers or daughters. Those Muslim girls are like
my own daughters. How can I indulge in pleasures, be alive and eat
and drink while somebody ill-treats my daughters? I have a feeling
that there is some exaggeration in this report. But on that ground it
should not be disregarded. And, if there is some exaggeration it is
only for good, because it would then make us think how low a man
could stoop. This is something which we would shudder to think. We
have opened a new chapter from yesterday, for, if the Sikhs have done
so, the Hindus and the Muslims have done it too. Let us forget about
the Muslims as we have made them helpless in the Indian Union. But
the Hindus and the Sikhs are not helpless. And so, they must think
what they should do. True, we are not indulging in such acts here.
But when someone commits a crime anywhere I feel I am the culprit.
You too should feel the same. If I were to commit any crime you
should also think that you too were guilty of it. Let us all merge in
each other like drops of ocean. If the drops of ocean remain apart
they would dry up. But when they mingle together in the ocean they
can carry huge ships across their expanse. As with the ocean so with
us. After all we also are an ocean of human beings. If one person
commits a crime, it amounts to all of us committing it. Then it
ceases to be a crime. We must all become alert. That is why I talked
about these things. But now I would like to come to the subject of
controls.</p>

Control on sugar has been removed. I hope and wish that controls on
cloth and food would also be removed. But how would those controls go
and what would be our duty after that? Since control on sugar has
been removed, I would first talk about it. Now there are big sugar
factories. But the owners of the factories  should  not  consider
themselves free to squeeze as much money from the people as they
fancy. If they raise the price of sugar, people  would  be reduced to
poverty. Fortunately the entire population of India does</p>

not  consume  sugar.  People  should  consume  <i>gu</i><i>r</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>for
  there   is  no control on it. The villagers can easily make <i>gur
</i>in their own homes, but they cannot make sugar. There are huge
factories in India where millionaires employ workers to produce
sugar. But <i>gur </i>can  be produced wherever sugar-cane is grown.
Moreover, <i>gur </i>is a very healthy thing to eat if it is clean.
When I was a child my father used to take me or I used to go with his
attendants to the villages where sugar-cane was grown. People of
those villages used to give us fresh and clean <i>gur </i>to eat. <i>Gur
</i>is a sort of food which sugar can never be. So, the poor people
should only eat <i>gur</i>. But today, some of them have started
taking tea and in their tea they put sugar rather than gur.  I would
like to tell them that they should put <i>gur </i>in their tea; but
would they listen to met? And when the price of sugar goes up, they
think it would be better to have control on sugar so that they could
have it cheaper. Under these circumstances, it is the supreme duty of
the sugar merchants and factory-owners to have a mutual arrangement
so that the entire country knows that with the freedom we have won we
would earn only clean money. We would not cheat or deceive people and
would root out all unclean and corrupt practices. If that does not
happen, I would be blamed because I have worked quite a bit for the
removal of controls, and am still working for it. If the sugar
merchants and factory-owners increase their margin of profit, the
price of sugar is bound to rise. If they take five per cent profit,
it can be called honest earning. But it cannot be called honest
earning if they pocket 10 or 20 per cent profit. Five per cent is
more than sufficient and they should not take more than that. And,
then, other controls would automatically go. Let not the Government
get a chance to say that controls were removed because we wanted them
to be removed and ask how the poor are now going to survive when they
do not get sugar at all. That should not be the case. The
factory-owners should become honest and form a committee to fix a
uniform price of sugar. No factory-owner should charge more than that
price. At the same time, the farmers who grow sugar-cane should not
get less than their due. If the price rises because the cultivators
are given more, then it becomes a matter of honest earning. They
should maintain proper accounts and make a public announcement of
what they pay to the farmers now as against what they were paid
earlier, that the amount goes straight into the pockets of the
cultivators and no middleman could</p>

swallow it and that as against the ten or twenty per cent they used
to take, they are not taking even five and a quarter per cent now.
Supposing the factory-owners do not take more than five per cent but
if the middlemen charge higher prices, consumers of sugar will be
really doomed. In that case, the factory-owners should sell sugar
directly to the consumers. I have no doubt that things would run
smoothly under such an arrangement.</p>

A gentleman writes to say that the train fares for third-class
travellers have been increased, though the increase is less compared
to that of the first and second classes, but he asks, and rightly,
why the third-class fares had to be raised even by this much. Granted
that our aims of progress are high and we require more funds to
achieve them. Then, if need be, we can increase the levy on tobacco
and many other imported as well as indigenously produced
non-essential items. It may serve our purpose to some extent. The men
in power in the Government ought to consider and examine the
feasibility of this proposition. But the point certainly needs to be
understood, and the Government should also know that I have got
people who give such useful suggestions. They are not unintelligent
people. Rather, they are very sensible. If today we have millions of
rupees with us, it does not mean that we should squander away
everything. We should spend even small amounts, out of those
millions, after careful consideration. And it is enough for me if
these small amounts thus spent benefit the poor villagers of India.
Out of the crores of rupees drawn from our villages, how much are we
able to return to them? A true <i>Panchayati </i><i>Raj </i>or
democracy has got to draw its resources from the people but, in
return, they should benefit the people tenfold. For instance, if I
take money from the people for education, I should give such
education to their children and have such an estimate of expenditure
that they should get back their money tenfold. For example, if I
start sanitation work in the villages and build roads for the village
people, they would know that the money they give is being used for
their own benefit. As a result, we would not be as crazy about our
military as we are now. Then we would decide to spend as little as
possible on the army and as much as possible on the general public.
In such a situation, people themselves become the army and start
acquiring knowledge  of military affairs. When they are thus able to
defend themselves and their neighbours, the defence of India is
automatically ensured. As it is no one can have designs on India.</p>

But right now, even though the British have gone, the atmosphere of
the British rule has not yet gone. Let us change that atmosphere. The
British used to spend extravagantly and the people did not get any
return from such expenditure. But now the people should get back
everything they give. Then it would be well for the country. This is
all I would like to say today.</p>

In this consummation, I have no doubt that all specially qualified
men and women such as doctors, lawyers, <i>vaids, hakims, </i>nurses,
traders and bankers should make common cause with the others and lead
a co-ordinated camp life in perfect co-operation, feeling not like
helpless dependents on charity, but resourceful, independent men and

enriched by their sufferings, a life full of promise for the future

I can understand the plight of those who have been uprooted from
their homes. But we have to find a way out of this situation. It is
truly a boon if one can find happiness in adversity. I have not the
slightest doubt that, if those who live in groups behave properly,
everyone’s interest will be served. If the doctors, <i>vaidyas,
</i>nurses, teachers, traders, jewellers, and people of other
professions among the refugees help one another it cannot but have
pleasing results. Camp life presents its own opportunities. If we
could only co-operate with one another and regulate our lives
properly no one  would  find himself in distress. We could then show
the world that though we had lost our all, we were still fully
prepared to face any calamity.</p>

Yesterday I wanted to mention one point; but since I had to talk
about many other things, it was left out. You must have seen that the
girls sit on the floor and they feel cold. I had told them that we
have plenty of papers and newspapers which we have read already and
these could be used for sitting on. But it is good that a friend has
spread a sheet today. In a way it is good to be unconcerned. Why
should we be so delicate that we feel cold by sitting on the floor?
Even if we have to sit on grass, if we can have a piece of paper and
if it does not get wet, then we would not feel cold. If this does not
serve the purpose, then we have our age-old custom of carrying our
own <i>asana</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>wherever
we go and spreading it whenever we have to sit. Today we have
forgotten that practice and given ourselves to comfortable living. I
suggest that we should forget about a piece of paper or newspaper,
take one if you want and if it is thick, but the best thing would be
an <i>asana </i>of wool or jute or even cloth or hay. All you have to
do is to spread it wherever you want to sit and tuck it under your
arm when you have to go. Since I am feeling cold, everybody must be
feeling the same. Moreover, doctors also say that we should not sit
on wet ground or where it is cold. If men wearing <i>dhotis </i>and
women wearing <i>salwars </i>or skirts use thick cloth as
undergarments, they can serve as <i>asans. </i>But the women too have
become very delicate and so their clothes must be soft. How can they
wear thick clothes? Their undergarments have to be soft. Hence, they
cannot protect them against this cold.</p>

I have received many telegrams from Kathiawar. I have already told

there. May be some ten thousand or so. I do not know how many people
must be reading them. But nothing would be achieved if I started
thinking whether those things had really happened. Hence it was good
that I placed before you what I had read in those newspapers. I do
not know if all those things are true. If they are true, they are a
matter of great shame for Kathiawar. And if they are not true, it is
a matter of shame for the newspapers. Thus it is a matter of shame
for either side. I have also told you what the Sardar has to comment
on the matter. He came today also and told me that whatever reports
came from there were not worth mentioning. They  were highly
exaggerated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But the telegram I have received from Rajkot is worth noting. It is a
fairly long telegram and I would like to mention it to you in brief.
After all, I know the Muslims of Kathiawar. I do not know them
individually, but I know the Khojas, Meenas, Vaghers and some  Kumbis
among the peasants, and Mahers. After all, I was born there and lived
there for almost 17 years. In fact I lived there for full 17 years,
because I did not go out to study anywhere. My father never sent me
anywhere. I completed my studies there and attended college for a few
months, and that too at Bhavnagar. Even for the examination I could
not go beyond Ahmedabad. That was my condition. I saw everything that
happened there and, later too, kept contact with the people by
visiting them. So, the sender of that telegram says that I am greatly
worried on their account, and, in turn, my worry has become their
worry. He says it is true that some Hindus in Kathiawar had lost
their balance, but is there any place where this has not happened.
They resorted to violence and even harmed some Muslims. They
destroyed their houses and even burnt them down. But, he says, the
Congressmen did not let the situation go far. They were under the
leadership of Dhebarbhai. I know him very well. He went forward to
protect the Muslims and succeeded to a great extent. Not all Hindus
were involved in those acts of loot and arson. Had that been the
case, all Muslim houses in Rajkot would have been set ablaze, there
would have been large-scale violence and some people would have been
killed. But things did not reach that point. The Congressmen and
others took every precaution. Dhebarbhai was abused  and manhandled.
Even though he is a big man and also a lawyer, when the mob gets
excited all considerations of big and small are forgotten. They
harassed him because he was trying to protect the Muslims. Some
people who accompanied Dhebarbhai write, that, though some</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
injury was caused, Dhebarbhai was saved by other people. The telegram
also mentions help from the Thakore Saheb and the police. In that
case, who are left to be suspected of creating the trouble? They say
“the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh— these
organizations have certainly done some mischief—their aim was to
drive out the Muslims at least from Rajkot. However they could not do
so. But now we have nothing more to worry and there is no danger to
the Muslims. So you also should not worry. We are watching the
situation elsewhere too and we would send you another telegram.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.21cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have received a telegram from a Muslim gentleman from the same
place. He expresses his extreme gratitude to the Congressmen and
others who tried their best to save the life and property of the
Muslims. But there is yet another telegram from Bombay also sent by a
Muslim gentleman. He states that what I had said earlier about
Kathiawar was correct but what I have been told later about it is not
correct. That lots of things have happened there and are still
happening.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I do not know whether I should believe the telegram from Bombay or
the one from the other Muslim gentleman. But I doubt the truth about
the telegram from Bombay because it has been sent from Bombay, while
the other one has been sent by those who are right in Kathiawar.
Moreover, the people of Kathiawar cannot deceive me. Where would they
escape after deceiving me? Hence I feel that the telegram from Bombay
gives an exaggerated version. The actual situation would be known to
me in due course. For the present, let me at least put all this
before you.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
There is also a telegram from Bhavnagar. It is  from  the Maharaja of
Bhavnagar. I know him too, because I have lived there for three or
four months. So he felt concerned about me and wondered why I was so
much worried. He has said in the telegram that I need not worry. He
says that they are all vigilant. The Hindus also are vigilant. They
would not let any harm come to the Muslims and I should have no doubt
at all about it</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But there is a telegram from Junagadh sent by some Muslims. They say
that I am being deceived, and I should set up a commission and
inquire whether the Muslims are being harassed or not. Similar
telegrams have also been sent to Jawaharlal, the Sardar and others. I
would like to say that it is not possible to appoint a commission for
anything and everything. Setting up a commission is no joke. Where</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
is the need for having a commission even though some harm might have
been done? As for Kathiawar, I am like a commission myself. If
anything comes to my notice, I can check it. I can handle the Princes
as well as the people of Kathiawar. I do not claim to succeed in
everything I undertake or that they abide by everything I say. But is
not Kathiawar the same as Bihar? If someone wants me to set up a
commission in Bihar, do you think I would oblige? I am at their
disposal myself. People there love me and listen to me. And so, it
would not be proper to set up any commission there.</p>

I have also received several letters from the Muslims in Rajkot. Many
of them are friendly with the Hindus and also happy with the
Congress. Then, who belongs to the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh? I can have no enmity towards them. They think
theirs is the only way of saving Hinduism. But I believe that
Hinduism will not be saved in that manner. They believe  in  violent
opposition to those who commit an evil act. But I would ask how
fighting an evil by another evil will help. We have got our own
Government. Take it to task and demand an explanation as to why such
things are happening. Moreover, our Government is vigilant and it is
trying its best. And so I would like to tell the Hindu Mahasabha and
also the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh—both are Hindu organizations
and many influential and educated  people  are associated with them
as in other organizations—that they cannot save Hinduism in this
manner. Is it true that they have harassed the Muslims? If not, who
has? The Congress has not harassed them, nor has either of the
Governments done it. Who then are the other Hindus who did it? Today
all the Hindus and Sikhs are to be blamed for this just as in
Pakistan all the Muslims are to be blamed, and rightly so. That is
why I would suggest that those who are innocent and yet are accused,
should clear their names. The Muslims in Junagadh can get justice if
they want. Why then should we set up a commission?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.23cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Having talked about the situation there, let me also talk about the
situation here. The Sardar has made some arrangements and he is going
to protect all the mosques we have here. You must have read the
notice sent by him in the newspapers that the occupied premises of
the mosques should be vacated in a week’s time, otherwise they will
be vacated with the help of the police. But I ask you what will he
gain by sending the police? If some Hindus have installed an idol in
some mosque—the idol may be of gold or silver or brass or earth or</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 5%"><br/>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.22cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
stone—but it is said, and I also believe, that so long as it has
not been sanctified and not worshipped by pure hands, in my view it
is not an idol but a mere piece of stone or gold. Such idols have
been installed in the mosque at the corner of Connaught Place. In my
view, there is no Hanuman in those idols. To me it is a mere piece of
stone which has been shaped like Hanuman and to which some  <i>sindoo</i><i>r</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>has
also been applied. In my view it is not worthy of worship. It can be
worshipped only if it is legitimately installed and sanctified. But
all this was not done. Hence it is the duty of those who have
installed the idols to remove them from there at daybreak and then
keep them wherever they choose. By thus installing idols in the
mosques they are desecrating the mosques and also insulting the
idols. As followers of Hinduism we are idol-worshippers, but
worshipping any idol in this manner is not religion but the opposite
of it. So, why should the Sardar send the police there? Those who are
Hindus among  you should become watchmen and remove the idols  so 
installed.  We should offer to repair the mosques which have been
damaged. But the Sardar says that the Government would bear the
expenses of  the  repairs of those mosques. Why should the Government
do it? is it not be cause we are not doing it ourselves? The
Government has to protect everybody. But it would be a matter of
shame for us all—Sikhs and Hindus today. Of course I have not heard
about any Sikh having installed the idols, for the Sikhs have only
one idol or, say, the holy treatise, that is, the <i>Granthsaheb. </i>I
have not known of any Sikh having kept the <i>Granthsaheb </i>in any
mosque. Even if any of them has done so he has insulted the
<i>Granthsaheb. </i>The <i>Granthsaheb </i>can be kept only in a
<i>gurudwara. </i>Only the holy Sikhs keep it on a high pedestal
after nicely decorating it. Somebody like me would wrap it in a nice
khadi cloth. But today, even though people do not think in terms of
swadeshi or foreign things we do manufacture beautiful woollens and
silks by hand. If we spread such silk cloth and keep the <i>Granthsaheb
</i>on it, it would be worthy of worship. And if any Sikh goes and
keeps it in a mosque, he insults the <i>Granthsaheb </i>and then it
cannot be worthy of worship.</p>

A Muslim gentleman came to see me today. I could not make out what he
wanted to say. But he was holding a copy of the Koran which was half
burnt. Even that was sacred for him and so he had wrapped it in a
very clean cloth. He opened the cloth and showed the</p>

burnt Koran to me. He did not say anything but looked at me with
tearful eyes and then went away. He talked a few things with
Brajkishan, since I was busy with my work. Similarly, if any Muslim
comes here and instals the Koran here and beats you and me up, I
would say that he is insulting the Koran. The Koran does not ordain
that people should be compelled to accept it.</p>

That is why I very respectfully wish to tell the Hindu Mahasabha and
the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and others who wish to listen to me
and also the Sikhs, that the Sikhs are great and if they turn good
and become true followers of Guru Nanak, the Hindus would then
automatically become good. I have great respect for the Sikhs in my
heart but today, everybody, whether Hindu or Sikh, is going astray
and India is being destroyed. Are we going to drag India into dust
after raising her high? Are we going to destroy our religion, our
achievements and our country? May God save us from all this.</p>

have repeated those allegations with the conditional  ‘if ’  no 
harm has been done to truth. The Congress and the administrators of
Kathiawar will gain to the extant that they take their stand on
truth. Friends assert that though truth comes out in the end the harm
is already done, for people who have no scruples about truth  or
falsehood dishonestly use my statements for their own purposes. I
should therefore guard myself against untruth being propagated. But
whenever people have resorted to such tactics they have failed and
they were exposed as dishonest and false. If I mention the

Let us consider the other side of the matter. Take Kathiawar again
for example. If I had not paid attention to the allegations contained
in some major newspapers of Pakistan which even the Prime Minister of
Pakistan had declared were true in substance, the Muslims would have
taken them as gospel truth. But now the Muslims have come to doubt
their veracity.</p>

I would like friends in Kathiawar and elsewhere to learn from this
the lesson that we will not let any trouble occur in our own house;
we will welcome criticism even if that criticism should be bitter; we
will become truthful and we will rectify any error we discover in
ourselves. We must not delude ourselves with the belief that we can
never make a mistake. Our bitterest critic is one who has some
grudge, fancied or real, against us. We shall correct him if we are
patient with him and, whenever the occasion arises, show him his
error, or correct our own when we are found to be in error. By doing
so we shall never go wrong. No doubt a balance must be preserved.
Discrimination is  always required. One must never take notice of

Today the atmosphere is poisoned. Allegations are being hurled at
each other by parties. To imagine in such a situation that we can
make no mistakes would be folly. We have not the good fortune today
to be able to make such a claim. It will be enough if with necessary
effort we succeed in eradicating the mischief and root it out. We can
do so only if our eyes and ears are open to see and hear about our
own shortcomings. Nature has so made us that we cannot see our own
shortcomings. We can see only those of others. Wisdom requires that</p>

Yesterday, I was not able to deal fully with the long telegram from
Junagadh, which I had received as I was about to leave for the prayer
meeting, for I had only cursorily glanced through it. Today I have
studied it fully. Those who had sent the wire state that the
allegations to which had referred the other day were founded in
truth. If this is so it is very bad for Kathiawar. If attempts have
been made to exaggerate the allegations that our workers have
admitted as true and which I have published, then those behind this
wire have done harm to Pakistan. They invite me to go to Kathiawar
and see things for myself. They ought to know that today I am not in
a position to do that. They demand an inquiry commission but before
that they must prepare their case. I grant that their purpose is not
to bring a bad name to Junagadh or Kathiawar. They want the truth to
be brought out and they want security for the life and property and
honour of the  minority community. They know, as everyone knows, that
newspaper propaganda especially when it is not wholly based on truth
can protect neither life nor property nor honour. To protect all
these three things those sending the wire should adhere to truth and
they should go and meet their Hindu friends. They know their friends
amongst Hindus. They know also that though I am at some distance away
from Kathiawar I am doing their work even from here. I have said this
after full deliberation and now I am collecting all the facts. I have
seen Sardar Patel. He says that to the extent that it lies within his
power no communal riot will be permitted and anyone misbehaving with
our Muslim brothers and sisters will be severely punished. The
Kathiawar workers, who are quite impartial, are trying to find out
the truth for themselves and trying to alleviate the sufferings of
the Kathiawar Muslims. They love Muslims as much as they love their
own selves. Will the Muslims help them?</p>

I appreciate your compassion. But I don’t think we can really
satisfy our sentiment by having the dogs castrated. We must learn the
art of keeping dogs. And we should kill stray dogs in the least
painful manner. I don’t mean to say that it involves no violence,
but I would claim that this is the least violent method.</p>

You want to go to Pakistan of your own free will, don’t you? When
your leaders came to me and pleaded that I should visit Panipat, they
told me that people were leaving for Pakistan against their will. But
now from what you say I gather that you yourselves want to go to
Pakistan. All the same I must tell you that this is your home. You
should stay here. Your safety is the responsibility of Dr. Gopichand
Bhargava—your Chief Minister—and he will fulfil that
responsibility. Nevertheless all men have to die one day. There are
28,000 refugees here. If all of you are cut down to the last man at
the hands of your brethren, you will have shown true bravery. It will
have brought glory to your religion. You should say, ‘Remove the

show such trust the Hindus will certainly protect you.</p>

Gandhi utter the words that you should leave India. Gandhi can only

In Pakistan many Hindu girls have been forcibly converted and
subjected to extreme barbarities. Hindus too have done similar
things. But I am telling you how you should behave like true Muslims.
You should seek help from the Pakistan Government and persuade your
brethren there to console the young women who have been abducted. You
should tell them: ‘Sisters, you have been cruelly treated.  We 
forgot that we were human. From now on you are our mothers, our
sisters, our daughters., If you work in this spirit  you  can  make
Pakistan really <i>pak— </i>really pure. Of the three things—human
dignity, life and property—you should make it your business to
safeguard one and devote yourselves wholly to service. Then, I assure
you, Hindus will worship you and you will be able to serve not only
Pakistan but also the Muslims living in India. Geographically you are
separated but no one in the world can separate the hearts. Where can
you run away from friends and relatives? Someone among you said  that
 Gurubachan Singh had behaved treacherously. I tell you that if a man
himself is honest it can do him no harm if the other party is
treacherous. I say this from personal experience. I am not preaching
like a Christian. Deception and lies can never succeed. Otherwise
truth would be at a discount in the world; anyone could get away with
lies.</p>

The Ministers have assured you that they will protect you even at the
risk of their own lives. Still if you are resolved to go and do not
place any trust in their word there is nothing further I can say to
you. What can I do to reassure you? If I should die tomorrow you
would again have to flee. Therefore you cannot go by what others say.
You have to decide for yourselves after considering what your duty is
towards the country, towards your brothers, towards the land that
gave you birth, where you grew up. This will not be because Gandhi
says it. There was a time when I wished to live a hundred and
twenty-five years. Today I do not have that wish any more. I do not
consider our present freedom as freedom. I consider it as the undoing
of the country. You are destroying the independence that we have
gained without shedding a drop of blood. You are cutting off your own
feet. Today Punja Saheb cannot be visited by any Sikh pilgrim. What a
sorry pass we have come to after we became free. If even now you</p>

what was the good of my saying something which the Ministers would

It was a large crowd. There must have been some twenty  thousand
people. The ground was filled to capacity. Roofs were covered with
people. They heard me in silence. But when the others began, people
stood up. It has become customary with us to give vent to anger. They
stood up and began to shout that the Muslims should be expelled. I
told them that it would not be good to drive out the Muslims. They
had their homes, and they should not be forced to leave; that forcing
the Muslims to leave would undo all our efforts there. I was ready to
resume my seat but Sardar Swaran Singh, being the Home Minister and
also a brave man, would not be cowed down, he said this would not do.
He tried to speak but nothing came of it. People continued their
shouting and continued to stand. Then their representative, their
leader came forward. He began with a <i>bhajan </i>in Punjabi. I had
not known that he was a poet. He knew that Punjabis like <i>bhajans</i>.
Then he admonished them in Punjabi and told them that he was their
representative and they must listen to him, that shouting would
achieve nothing. What would they gain by disturbing the meeting. It
would only harm them. Peace was restored at last but it took some
doing. People sat down and the proceedings were</p>

I cannot speak Punjabi but I understand it. I liked what [Sardar
Swaran Singh] said. When we were with the Muslim leaders he had
assured them that whatever might happen in Pakistan we would not
become inhuman. He said that ours was a democratic Government and
would not let such things happen here. If any Muslim girl had been
kidnapped she would be restored by every means. Help  would certainly
be needed for they would not know where an abducted girl was. But if
it was known she would be brought back. The other thing they would do
was about the Muslims who had been converted to Hinduism or Sikhism.
They were still Muslims. Such  conversion would not be accepted as
lawful, for it was against morality. Similarly the Muslims who were
still here would be protected whether or not Pakistan protected [the
Hindus and Sikhs]. Thirdly, Sardar Swaran Singh said that the mosques
would be protected. Of course, protection of life and property was a
difficult matter. There was the police, the Government—they would
do what they could, but if everyone took to plunder and pillage they
could not be shot down. The Government was helpless. Our freedom was
crippled and we had to confess our helplessness. They could certainly
plead with people but they had to admit their helplessness. He was
very persuasive. He pleaded  with them saying that India’s honour
and dignity were in their hands, that the Government was theirs, for
it was they who had elected the Ministers. And since the Government
was there it would do its duty, do what it must and they must help.
He explained all this. It took a long time. In the end there was
peace at the meeting. Every time it happens that when people lose
their temper on such occasions, they begin to understand things after
a time when they calmly think over it. I saw this during the course
of our struggle for freedom. There were many occasions when it looked
as if the meeting would have to be terminated, but in the end they
saw the point. Afterwards the representatives of the refugees came
and followed me. I asked them to accompany me in the car. If I was
not to do so, I would have been further delayed. I had to count every
minute, for I wanted to reach here in time. I have forgone my siesta.
When everyone is unhappy, how can I seek rest? I am certainly much
more comfortable than they are. They tell me that the refugees there
are in much distress. Of course something has been done. Things are
certainly much better than I had seen them last. Some arrangements
have been made. Some roofs have been put up. They certainly have
tents to live in, but the</p>

food is not all that it should be. The Governor of East Punjab<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>also saw it and admitted that it should be improved.
As to clothing it seems all the decent clothing is taken away by some
people. What shall I say as to who does it? The result is that the
refugees get only rags. This should not be so. They must get the
things that are intended for them. People die too, which is only
natural. Two persons had died; there was no firewood to cremate them.
A whole day was lost. I forget the name of the doctor in charge. He
was not to be found anywhere. By then it was seven in the evening.
Since no arrangement could be made for firewood, some people
approached a relative of one of them and offered to raise a
contribution of ten to fifteen rupees. But the relative who was a
strong man refused to accept the donation. He said that if there was
no firewood he would bury the dead. Burial is not common among the
Hindus and I was sorry that he had to do it.</p>

I learnt afterwards that well-to-do refugees are able to get things
but not the poor ones because the arrangements are not in the hands
of senior officers. The workers were taken from among the people
there and everything is done through them. If they are good,
altruistic and dedicated to service things go well. But if they do
not have the spirit of service it becomes difficult. I like to have
everything in the open. Let us not resort to physical violence. It
generates poison. We have an alternative method and that is to speak
up frankly. It does not do to hide things. One must call a spade a
spade. What is lost by accusing those who indulge in evil practices?
If they are guilty the charge should be made. That is why I tell you
that it is a bad practice. We are already unhappy. Hundreds of
thousands of people have been uprooted from their homes and have come
here. If we indulge in such practices it would be very bad. Today a
small boy confronted me. He was wearing a sweater. He took it off and
stood glaring at me as if he would eat me up. He was just a child.
What could he do? “You say that you have come to protect us”, he
said, “but my father has been killed. Get me my father back.” But
his father was dead. How could I bring him back. The boy became
angry. I can imagine that if I had been of his age and in his
position perhaps, I would have done the same. I was not annoyed. I
felt sorry for him.</p>

supervise. Other people too had to be supervised. At least the
distribution of blankets should be entrusted to them. Their children
should get milk but the milk does not reach them. The staff
appropriates it. Would it not be better to give them the milk for
distribution rather than that the members of the committee should
drink it up? Then some of them have been receiving letters from other
refugees elsewhere. They ask them in the letters to tell the Mahatma
to attend to them too. It is good I went there. I told them to be
peaceful and to persuade the Muslims to stay on. I told them that it
would be something unique for Panipat which has been the scene of so
many battles.</p>

There are 28,000 refugees living in the camp. I told them, “If more
refugees join you what can it matter to you? It is enough for you if
you get food to eat, clothes to wear and a roof or even a tent to
live under. You can get nothing more than this wherever you may go.
You can create many things out of these three things. You should know
what developments are taking place all over  India,  what problems
are coming up and how we can solve  them.  The Government is there,
but the Government cannot force you to do anything.”</p>

Yesterday Jawaharlal said a beautiful thing. I happened to see it in
the papers today; it is rarely that I get a chance to read anything.
Jawahar says that he does not like being called Prime Minister. When
did he ever become Prime Minister? He would like it and it would be
more appropriate to call him the first servant of the  nation.  If 
everyone became the first servant he would have to think of others
all the twenty-four hours of the day. If the officers under
Jawaharlal were to think so, our country would become a land of gold.
We would have Ramarajya, the kindgom of God upon earth. Then our
freedom would be complete. If after attaining freedom we continue to
conduct ourselves in the manner we are doing now then that freedom
will irk me. Is this the kind of freedom we are going to have? No, it
cannot be.</p>

I have your letter. It will not help me in any way to call you here.
I still do not feel confident about you. The final decision lies with
Chimanlal and others. You can stay on only if you win their
confidence. But how can you stay on if you yourself have no faith in
them? They have no axe to grind. They assumed the responsibility of
letting you stay there for my sake. Be calm now and do what seems
proper to you. Don’t hurt their feelings.</p>

Faith by itself also will not do. It must  be  supplemented  by
knowledge. Training in ahimsa is not to be had like training in the
use of weapons in military training colleges and institutions. It
requires purity of heart and soul-force. The difficulty we find in
pitting non-violence against violence only shows our inner weakness.

allow the slightest hint of violence to enter his heart. How then can
his conduct be violent?</p>

	I receive many visitors. I do not relate to you everything they say.
	I do let you know if something is important enough. Today I had some
	visitors. It appeared they had had some business with the Prime
	Minister. They said the Prime Minister had earlier made a certain
	promise to them and that he was now going back on the promise. How
	was that, I asked. They said they had his letter. I asked them to
	show me the letter. After all I had no more power than they. I was
	not the Government. Yes, I was a servant, a friend of the Prime
	Minister, a co-worker, and so I would speak to him. But how was I to
	mention it to him? Then I reflected on the matter and I asked myself
	why this sort of thing happened,—people saying one thing and doing
	another.  I have to bear the brunt of all this. I am sure that I
	have never deliberately deceived anyone. It is possible  that, 
	without understanding the implications, one may say something in all
	good faith without any dishonest motives. And yet a person may feel
	aggrieved thinking that he has been deceived. Often things are not
	fully understood and the result is breach of faith. But if a person
	deliberately breaks a promise it is a bad thing. This  should  not
	happen. The best thing is to keep quiet. Once we have put into words
	what we feel, we must act accordingly. Only then can we be said to
	be keeping our word. And now especially when we are free and run the
	Government in the name of the millions we must be very careful. We
	must show restraint, discretion and humility. We must not be
	arrogant. Only then can we take our work to a successful conclusion.

we shall distribute a certain thing free of cost and later say that
we shall charge something even a little for it, then it is breach of

word. We make a promise today and wriggle out of it the very next
day. If I make an appointment with you for 4 o’clock tomorrow but
at the appointed time go off to a dance, it is breach of faith. So I
say that we have to be very careful. We must stick to our word, we
must weigh our words before we utter them. We must not say anything

colour it and say that there was murder. This sort of thing cannot be

A doctor from Sind has written to say that the Harijans left behind
there are in a pitiable condition.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>If only Harijans were left behind in Sind and caste
Hindus went away, nothing but annihilation awaited them. The only
condition for life there would be complete slavery and ultimate
acceptance of Islam. This is a bad situation. Today the situation is
such that if the Pakistan Government says something, the officials at
its behest do not implement it. Of course the same thing is true of
India. Jawaharlal and the Sardar say that they shall protect Muslims,
they shall not allow even a single Muslim to be driven away to
Pakistan, but it does not happen. They do not have people to enforce
what they say. Their subordinates do not carry out their wishes and
the people too do not pay any heed. Yesterday I told you that I had
been to Panipat. All the Hindus and Sikhs who have arrived there are
in a miserable plight. They  were  ill-treated  in Pakistan and they
had to flee. They came because they  were  oppressed. Otherwise what
was the need for them to run away? Having themselves run away from
oppression, does it behove them to force others into a similar
situation? But this happens. How then can I complain to Pakistan? But
I have to do so. The correspondent has written in detail. He says no
Harijan wants to continue living in Sind. If they want to stay
together at one place they are not left in peace. Forced labour is
extracted from them. They are told to clean  lavatories, do the
sweeping and so on. A Bhangi should not be forced to clean lavatories
today. If he can become a barrister, why should he</p>

If they are told that they can stay only if they embrace Islam, what

statement Jagjivan Ram<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Sind. If they want to come they should be given facilities to do so.
So long as they are in Pakistan they must be allowed to go about
their business unhampered; otherwise they should be allowed to leave.
If this is not done it is going to leave a permanent sore spot on the
Hindu and the Sikh minds. Although India and Pakistan are two
countries, we cannot forget one another. We have to conduct ourselves
as gentlemen. We must not hurt anyone. We must not force anyone to
become a Muslim. We must not molest and abduct anyone’s wife or
daughter. Dr. Gopichand Bhargava and Sardar Swaran Singh also said
yesterday that India could not tolerate such things. Today the
atmosphere has become so polluted that if a Muslim says that he has
embraced Hinduism this should not be accepted as genuine. Harijans
are non-Muslim. If they say that they have embraced Islam it is not
to be accepted. It is only fear that makes them say so. All such
conversions should be considered null and void.</p>

Contradictory reports are coming from Kathiawar. Some reports say
that the situation in Kathiawar is as bad as described. A telegram to
that effect has come only today. Other reports are from  the Congress
sources and these say that such is not the case, that the Congress
workers can never indulge in such things. The Hindu Mahasabha and the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh say that they have never burnt anybody’s
house. Which reports am I to accept as true? Shall I believe the
Congress, or the Muslims, or the Hindu Mahasabha and the Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh? It has become very difficult to get at the truth.
If mistakes have been committed we must acknowledge them. If the
Hindus have been in the wrong, if they have committed excesses, it
must be admitted. But if this is not the case and if the Muslims
exaggerate when they say that their properties were burnt, they were
forced to become Hindus, that their daughters were abducted, we must
proclaim it to the world that that was not the case. Similarly if the

in Pakistan and to Muslims in India. They have driven away Hindus and
Sikhs from Pakistan under threats. There are still a large number of
Hindus and Sikhs in Bannu. What will happen to them I do not know.
Meharchand Khanna<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5   </font></sup>has

people whose lives may or may not be saved. If they survive they will
have to embrace Islam. But at Bannu the number is very large. What

What can the Government do? It has its own problems. What I have to
say here applies also to the Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs in South 
Africa. I must tell them that victory and defeat are of no
consequence. ‘You must say that you will live in South Africa with
honour, that you will not leave. You did not go there because you
wanted to. You were invited. You went as indentured labourers and
afterwards you had children there. If it is a question of rights no
one except the Negroes have a right to be there. The Boers do not
have even as much right as you have’. There were delegations from

U.N.O. Our country also had to send a delegation. We acted rightly.
People assemble there to bring about justice, that they cannot or
will not is another matter. We must continue our fight in South
Africa, not with a sword but with soul-force. Even the little girl
sitting beside me has soul-force, others too have it. The soldiers,
too, have soul-force. The sword can be snatched away from us. We can
be disarmed. Our arm can be cut off but no one can take away our
soul. It is eternal. It is there today and it will remain tomorrow
and the day after. The body is worthless without the soul. The body
one day has to be disposed of. My wife died and I could not keep her
with me. Mahadev<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>died who was of so much help to me. But I could not keep
him and his body had to be cremated. So I shall say that if the
Indians in South Africa have self-respect which I think they have, if
they have courage, they must say that even if they did not secure
two-thirds of the votes at the U. N. they did secure a very large
number. They must tell the whites of South Africa to let them stay in
the country with honour. They must tell them that they intend to
conduct themselves with dignity. They do not want government service.
They do not expect help from the whites but they must be allowed to
breathe the air, drink the water and live on the land. After all they
pay their way, earn their keep, wherever they want to stay. They do
not claim the right to vote. If they want the vote they must have it
in the same way as the whites have it; otherwise they will do without
it. They will not carry on satyagraha for franchise but they must
safeguard their dignity. They must have bread and they must have
water and they must have land. Also their children must have
education. They will understand if no grants are forthcoming for the
purpose but the education for the children is their right and they

	I talked to you yesterday about Kathiawar. Today I have a telegram
	from Shamaldas. Yesterday I had a telegram from Dhebar- bhai too.
	Both say that the news I have been receiving had  been highly
	exaggerated. So far as they know no women had been  abducted and
	there was not a single case of murder. In fact after Sardar Patel
	went there nothing untoward happened. Before that there had been
	some little rioting and looting. Shamaldas was upset by my
	statements, and that was but natural. He has gone to Kathiawar from
	Bombay. He will make an investigation and let me know. I have been
	receiving telegrams also from the U. S. A., Iran and London
	repeating the charge that the Muslims in Kathiawar have been
	subjected to  terrible atrocities. Truthful people should not
	indulge in this kind of propaganda. And what has Iran got to do with
	what happens in India?</p>

Shamaldas Gandhi says that he makes no distinction between Hindus and
Muslims. I would like to help the Muslims who write to me provided
they are on the path of truth. But if they give up truth and make a
mountain out of a molehill and if they spread stories all over the
world, that will be two much. I can understand wires coming from
inside India but when wires come from abroad it pains me.</p>

I have received a letter from a Muslim in Hoshangabad. It is a very
good letter. Guru Nanak’s birthday is an important day. Sikhs
wherever they are celebrate it. At Hoshangabad also they celebrated
it and invited the Muslims. They assured them that they were brothers
and the Sikhs had no quarrel with them. Perhaps I told you once how
at the Hoshangabad station a Muslim was on the point of being killed
and the Sikhs had come to his rescue. So if on Guru Nanak’s
birthday the Sikhs really did what the correspondent describes, it is
a great thing. If this example is followed everywhere the blot on us
will be removed. I thought that the newspapers should give publicity
to such happenings.</p>

Another thing I want to talk to you about is the Chamber of Commerce.
I have already hinted to you about the Marwari and European Chamber
of Commerce.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>If
we can have a Marwari Vyapari Mandal why can we not have a Muslim
Vyapari Mandal too? But the Marwari Vyapari Mandal people say that it
is for all and that others besides Marwaris are represented on it. I
enquired as to how many Marwaris it had and how many Hindus, how many
Sikhs, how many Europeans. The letters I have received from them are
in English. They have sent a statement of their policy and their
rules and their report— all in English as if I did not know
Hindustani or Hindi. I confess that I do not know English as well as
I know my own language. How can I disregard the language that I
imbibed with my mother’s milk and give more importance to English
which I first started learning at the age of twelve? I asked if there
were many Englishmen on that body. They must tell me what it is all
about. If the name is Marwari Vyapari Mandal, then how can everyone
join it? The Muslim Chamber of Commerce can similarly say that it
represents everybody. It can have on it a Hindu or two. This sort of
thing does not convince one.</p>

humility. I told him that it was a very good thing that he had paid a
visit to India. Our country was geographically large and its culture
was no doubt ancient. But what was happening today—the mutual
mistrust of Hindus and Muslims—was not something from which anyone 
could learn anything. Guru Nanak preached that the Sikhs should be
friendly with both Muslims and Hindus. In fact there is no such
distinction between Hindus and Sikhs. Tara Singh has said that one
cannot separate Hindus and Sikhs. I should be very happy if we could
conduct ourselves thus. The two religions are fundamentally  one.
Even Guru Nanak never said that he was not a Hindu nor did any other
Guru. If we read the <i>Granthsaheb </i>we shall find that it is full
of the teachings of the Vedas and Upanishads. The teachings of Koran
are similar. The same is true of the teachings of Guru Govind Singh.
What he taught is also to be found in the Hindu scriptures. There is
nothing wholly new. He has only emphasized certain things. I claim
that they originate from the Vedas. It cannot be said that Sikhism,
Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism are separate religions. All these four
faiths and their offshoots are one. Hinduism is an ocean into which
all the rivers run. It can absorb Islam and Christianity and all the
other religions and only then can it become an ocean. Otherwise it
remains merely a stream along which large ships cannot ply.</p>

What Burma can take from India is its culture which today has fallen
into disrepute. Never before in history has there been a single
instance of so large a country with such immense population securing
its freedom not by violent conflict but through non-violence. You 
may say that the English had got fed up and they left. That is not
so. If there is anything to be learnt from India, it is non-violence.
Not that we have learnt the lesson of non-violence fully. We are
weak. We took to non-violence because we had not the weapons for a
violent fight. Non-violence is the best weapon. Only the pure of
heart can use it. I therefore told the Burmese Prime Minister that if
he wished to take anything from India it should be this non-violence.
He must not think that if India lapsed into barbarity, how could
Burma which took its religion from India advance? I told him that if
he wanted to copy India he must copy the good qualities that India
once had and still retained. He must not take anything barbarous. We
must export only what is good so that the world may learn from us.
Had India not attained its freedom, Burma and Ceylon also would not
have attained theirs. And India did not become free by resorting to
the sword. And if we did not need the sword for securing freedom, we
will not need it</p>

for sustaining it. If we cannot keep our freedom without the sword,
then I shall think that India has done nothing for the world. Today
we have an army.Attempts are being made to strengthen it. Attempts
are also being made to further enlarge the Navy and the Air Force. I
declare that in this way we are not really strengthening ourselves.
We shall be doing no good to the world in this way. And if the world
learns this kind of thing from us it is not going to gain anything,
rather it will be doomed.</p>

Jehangir Patel and Dr. Dinshaw Mehta are going there to  observe for
themselves the condition of Muslims in Kathiawar. They are going in
their individual capacities and not on my behalf or with my
authority. They feel that this is the best contribution they can make
towards the service of the country. Introduce them to whomsoever you
think it necessary for them to meet in  this connection. They will
not stay in Kathiawar for long. It will not be more than eight to ten
days. They know the Jamsaheb. If necessary, they will meet the other
Princes too. We have to consider what truth there is in the
allegations made by the Muslims.</p>

	The letters given to me here are sometimes too long. You cannot
	expect me to go through them and answer them, because it takes time
	even to read them. I cannot read them here for it would be wasting
	my time and yours. I have a note which mentions my meeting Liaquat
	Ali Khan. The writer asks if I am still not satisfied that nothing
	untoward has happened in Kathiawar. If the writer of the note is
	present I may tell him that nothing has happened in Kathiawar.
	Shamaldas Gandhi says that nothing has happened to justify the
	reports that I have received. There had been incidents but minor
	ones. They were given publicity by the Pakistan newspapers and
	telegrams were dispatched. The reports were terrible but such
	terrible things did not happen. Today I have another wire from
	Shamaldas. He says he has made investigations and found that such
	things had not taken place. Certainly after the Sardar’s visit to
	Kathiawar nothing untoward has happened. The reports I had earlier
	received appeared to suggest it was the Sardar who incited the
	people to rowdyism. But after he went to Kathiawar no incidents took
	place. This changes the complexion of things. Shamaldas Gandhi says
	that he will tell Muslims not to send such telegrams. I have
	received further telegrams from the very Muslims who had earlier
	made the allegations, admitting that they were exaggerated and that
	they had made a mistake. They have also written to say that the
	reports carried by the Pakistan newspapers were incorrect, that the
	extent of the damage reported was also wrong and it could not be
	said that the Muslims were scared and nervous. I am happy to hear
	it. I have said that I shall do whatever I can for our Muslim
	brethren. We must never kick one who is already down. We must raise
	him up. This is the demand of humanity, of love, this is civilized
	behaviour. I shall never throw anyone down even if he be my
	enemy—though of course I have no enemy. It was a mere dream that
	the Muslims would get everything once Pakistan came into being.
	After all it is not as if only those who are in Pakistan would be
	left alive and those outside Pakistan would be killed. Pakistan is a
	veritable</p>

sea of Hindus and Muslims. Will they drive out all the Hindus and
Sikhs from there? Those that have come out did not really want to
leave their homes. But it has happened. I have received letters from
Sikhs saying that they will know no rest till they are able to go
back. For instance a person may have a thousand-acre farm near
Lyallpur where he had been growing wheat, bananas, cotton and fruits.
How can he leave it for good? He will not rest till he can go back.
And what happened in India? The displaced Sikhs were furious and
wanted revenge. I said it was not humanity. It was barbarism. They
should not indulge in it, that good should be returned for evil. We
must not copy the wrong-doer, we must emulate the man who does good. 
It, therefore, gave me satisfaction when I received that wire from
Kathiawar. I shall tell my Muslim brethren: if  something had
happened they should have toned it down to a half or even a quarter;
they should not have exaggerated it and given it publicity in foreign
countries. After all if Hindus and Sikhs—though there are no Sikhs
there—go wild, can the world save the Muslims? Yes, they can say
that we have not made the right use of our freedom. They can threaten
to take it away. All that is possible. But the dead will not return
to life thereby. We should therefore never exaggerate. Our agony is
our own and no outsider can take it on himself. We should try to make
light of it. We impress the world only when we exaggerate the good
work done by another, not his folly.</p>

There is another thing I must tell you. It does not concern you but I
can convey it through you. I have told Brijkrishna not to give anyone
any appointment to see me from the 6th to the 13th. That I do not
want to see people does not mean that I am ill or that I want to
enjoy myself. For many months now this matter has been under

there will be meetings of the Spinners’ Association, Nayee Talim,

certainly consume some time. How am I to give my time to these

happen tomorrow, but a process has started and everybody says I have
done a good thing by suggesting it. I have received letters from all
quarters saying that it would be good if the controls were lifted. Of
course if the controls are lifted it will not mean that we shall be
relieved of our obligations. Once decontrol comes into effect certain
obligations devolve on the traders. I must tell Ghanshyamdas also to
produce more cloth. He may say that he only carries out orders. He
produces what cloth he is asked to produce and he takes the price.
But once the cloth is decontrolled, what will Ghanshyamdas and other
friends do? Does it mean they will be free to loot the people? In
that case I shall be having a very bad time. People will hold me
responsible for it. I am a servant of India irrespective of my
status. If what I say does not appeal to the Government, that is, to
those running the Government, it will have no effect however much I
may shout. I am not God so that whatever I may say will prevail. I
discuss and decide and then say that the control on cloth and other
articles should be lifted. It means that if five maunds of foodgrain
is available today, we shall have ten maunds tomorrow because I feel
that some of it has been hoarded. But if the peasants do not have any
foodgrain and I say that the control should be lifted, will the
people not then starve? I am not a fool who will let the people
starve. I myself do  not  starve because Ghanshyamdas makes available
to me goat’s milk and fruit and vegetables. I believe that the
farmers have enough foodgrain but that the price offered is so low
that they cannot even feed themselves on it. They part with whatever
the Government forces out of them. For the rest they say they will
declare their stocks after the control is lifted. I feel that if the
farmers can clear their stocks at a good price they will not starve.
Admitting that we do not have as much foodgrain as we need, does it
mean that a person should eat all that he can lay his hands on, while
his neighbours starve? If we have sunk so low, then there is no cure.
Control certainly is not the cure. If that happens the Government
which is run by our Ministers must abdicate. People indulge in
deceit. They are not truthful. The traders who should carry on trade
for the benefit of the people are interested in filling their own
coffers and in amassing wealth for their sons and daughters. What
should the Government do? Should it use force or should it shoot
people down? We do not have such power nor do we want such power.</p>

We may have a police force but not for shooting down people. If we
start shooting down people who will be left alive? Where is our
thirty-year old training? Where is our humanity? This cannot go on.
In this way we shall only lose our newly gained freedom. I,
therefore, say that controls must go. If the Government says that
decontrol will lead to starvation, then I shall say that Panchayat
Raj has not been established, democracy has not come to us, that
Ramarajya has not been established and it is for Ramarajya that I
want to keep myself alive. I shall say that those who are made free
from controls should have self-imposed controls on themselves and
make others happy.  The civil servants in the Government may call me
names. They may say I have no right to interfere, that I have no
experience of running a government, that afterwards it would be
difficult to reimpose the controls and feed the people. I shall say
they are right. I have never been in the civil service, I have never
run a government, but I have moved among the millions. I know their
hearts. I understand them.</p>

Now about cloth. About food you may say that we have not enough stock
of it. But nobody has yet said that we do not have enough cotton. We
have so much of it that we export it. You will say we do not have
enough mills. I shall say the mills are in our homes. They are in the
homes of all the women sitting here. Every one of you has been
blessed with two hands. If you want clothes on your back you should
spin. If you cannot, you may go naked. We  have  a  number of mills
but if the production does not come up to the requirement we must
resort to hand-spinning and hand-weaving. Weaving is not difficult.
We have so many weavers in our country that we can have any amount of
cloth woven, but some people have a delicate taste. They will weave
only mill-yarn. They cannot weave hand-spun yarn. If they start
weaving hand-spun yarn there is no need to go naked. Then our
beautiful country—the home of so many hundreds of millions who know
their trade, who know how to produce cloth—cannot go naked.
Therefore control on cloth is the limit of ignorance and the sooner
it is lifted the better. So far as foodgrain is concerned the farmers
and traders must declare that they produce and sell to meet the
people’s needs, and they will not indulge in dishonest practices.
The farmers should understand that they have to grow crops not merely

When someone has fever the doctor first seeks to rid him of the fever
by giving a mixture. The fever goes down. But it will come back, for
the disease has not been diagnosed and the cause of the fever has not
been traced. Similarly most people in the world today want an end to
war, but wars continue. If the causes of wars were discovered and
justice done where justice was demanded, there would be no wars.
Today various groups of people have been pleading with the Government
to ban cow-slaughter. I know that even beef-eaters have asked for
such a ban, but as soon as a cow goes dry people stop looking after
her. They do not ask that cows should be cared for. They simply ask
that cow-slaughter should be stopped.  But  if everyone looked after
cows well and insisted that no one should eat beef, cow-slaughter
would stop by itself. But beef-eating goes on, the cows are neglected
and yet the Government is asked to stop cow-slaughter. That would be
making fun of the Government. In the same way one must first look
deeply into the causes of wars and seek ways to remove those causes.
Wars in a large measure are fought over economic issues. If we give
up selfishness and resolve to take the barest minimum for the
satisfaction of our wants, there will be no occasion for wars. Unless
there is a complete transformation in our economy and our style of
life, peace will elude us, however hard we may strive for it. Europe
and America want peace and yet they use their intellectual, technical
and scientific resources for production of</p>

These have promoted black-marketing, hoarding, corruption and other

arrested the incentive to production specially in the matter of
growing more foodstuffs-and the manufacture of hand-spun and
hand-woven khadi in the thousands of villages in India. The Committee
