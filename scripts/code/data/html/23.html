	Despite the mission of Sir Benjamin Robertson, the South Afri- can 
	Commissions<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1     </font></sup>has
	 delivered  an  adverse  finding.  Commissions, Lord Morley<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
	  </font></sup>has often said, serve no useful purpose. They raise
	false hopes, and, for the time being, divert public attention from
	matters they are appointed to deal with. They give time for passions
	to cool down. But they rarely do justice. Indeed, it is notorious
	that Com- missions avoid abstract justice. They offer, or effect,
	com-promises. But the South African Commission has offered, or
	effected, no compromise. It has delivered the Indian in the hands of
	his white rival in trade. It has reaffirmed the principle of white
	supremacy, as Mr. Andrews so often puts it. The principle has almost
	become a passion and  a  religion.  In  1901,  the   late   Sir  
	Pherozeshah<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3      </font></sup>rated
	  me   for ‘wasting my time,’ as he put it, on South Africa.
	During the satya- graha campaign, he was the last, as he said
	himself; to be enthused. And when he was enthused, it was not the
	justice of the cause (which he never doubted) but it was the
	incarceration<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4   </font></sup>of
	Mrs. Gandhi which roused his chivalrous spirit, and threw him into
	the struggle. He used to say that I should return to India and work
	for the freedom of the whole of India, rather than for a handful of
	Indians in South Africa.</p>

	I thought then, as I think even now, that whilst the un-crowned king
	of the Presidency of Bombay was right about concentrating on India’s
	freedom, he was wrong in thinking that I should have withdrawn from
	South Africa. We dare not neglect our countrymen abroad. The battle
	of India’s freedom involves the protection of the rights of the
	least of our countrymen, no matter where they might be situated. But
	at the present moment, I must invite our countrymen in South Africa
	to carry on their battle bravely and single-handed, and help us here
	in the best way they can. India’s fate must be decided</p>

The South African problem bears the same character as the pro- blem
at home. We too are fighting the religion of white supre-macy. The
refusal to recognize the Muslim claim, the encircling of the Arabs, 
the   negotiations   with  the   Ameer<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>,  the   refusal   to   stop   the pensions of Sir
Michael O’Dwyer and General Dyer, and frankly to dismiss men who
maltreated the Punjabis in 1919, are symptoms of the same disease.
Either that supremacy must go in its entirety, or those of us who
recognize the tubercular nature of the disease must perish in the
attempt to combat it. The Government of India can, if they wish, put
up an energetic and open fight against the proposed breach of faith
which the Commission implies. The spirit of the settlement of 1918
was that the position of the Indian all over South Africa must be
levelled up, not a single right then existing should be in any way
endangered. The Commission has not only put its <i>impri- matur </i>on
the encroachments already made on existing rights, but it has itself
suggested further and egregious curtailment thereof. Be- tween free
nations such an authoritative pronouncement would lead to open
rupture. The Report of the Commission can only spur my non-
co-operation spirit to further effort.</p>

I think the duty of non-co-operators is clear regarding Lord Reading.
Whilst we may not take part in any demonstrations of welcome, we may
not also undertake, or countenance, any counter demonstration. We
have no quarrel with Englishmen, or even with officials as such. We
seek to, and we must, destroy the system they are called upon to
administer, because we regard it as wholly evil in its totality. We
must dissociate ourselves from individual officials, who, like Sir
Michael O’Dwyer and General Dyer, have wronged India, and have been
untrue to her salt. Lord Reading has a golden opportunity. He belongs
to a race which has a fine imagination. He knows what a ‘pariah’
means and how he feels If he examines the non-co-ope- rators’ case
with impartiality, and if he fails in his advocacy of her claims, he
must himself become a non-co-operator. He may not ask them to
forgive, where there is no frank and full repentance. Nor must he ask
the Muslims to give up their just claims or the Hindus to sell their
fellow-country men. Lastly, His Excellency may not ask India to
postpone the attainment of her birthright, whether for the sake of
Lancashire or any other consideration. His Lordship therefore will
have [to] have an exceptionally strong will to resist an environment
which is almost wholly antagonistic to the Indian case. Non-co-ope-
rators must do nothing to add to his diffi-culties. We must give His
Excellency the fullest credit for meaning to do well. But I would
also warn them against building hopes on Lord Reading doing anything.

Mr. T. B. Purohit asks several pertinent questions about non-
co-operation. Before answering, it will be, perhaps, better to lay
down some general tests. The primary motive of non-cooperation is
self-purification by withdrawing co-operation from an unrighteous and
unrepentant Government. The secondary object is to rid ourselves of
the feeling of helplessness by being independent of all Government
control or supervision, i.e., to govern ourselves in all possible
affairs; and, in fulfilling both the objects, to refrain from doing
or promoting injury, or violence, to any individual or property.</p>

I have some experience of these societies. And I have no hesitation
in saying that registration interferes with their free growth and
increases people’s dependence upon the Government. The idea of such
societies is excellent and should be nursed, but we need not think
that we cannot promote such societies without Government aid or
inspection. I know the usual arguments in favour of registration. But
on an analysis, they will all be found to betray want of faith in
ourselves. I would, therefore, in this instance, too, first try to
convince my fellow members of the inutility of registration, and, on
failure, secede from the society or bank, and educate the public to
boycott such societies or banks. I know that, at least in one
instance, regis- tration has been removed, and everyone knows that
India has thou- sands of unregistered flourishing banks whose honesty
and busi- ness-like methods are still among the wonders of the world.</p>

General Dyer for his massacre, but I would not call it voluntarily

If violence results from non-co-operation,or if non-co-operators
resort to violence, i.e., if India makes violence her creed, and I
have survived, I would not care to live in India. She will cease to
evoke any pride in me. My patriotism is subservient to my religion. I
cling to India like a child to its mother’s breast, because I feel
that she gives me the spiritual nourishment I need, she has the
environment that responds to my highest aspirations. When that faith
is gone, I shall feel like an orphan without hope of ever finding a
guardian. Then the snowy solitude of the Himalayas must give what
rest it can to my bleeding soul. Needless to say, the violence that
would drive me to the Himalayas is not the violence of language or
rowdyism which my critics often fling in my face whilst reminding me
of the Himalayas. It is violence not due to non-co-operation, nor is
it violence of the real non-co-operators. These outbursts are a
legacy of our undisciplined past. It is being brought under check day
by day. It is so insignificant as to be itself a mighty

The questioner forgets that when violence reigns supreme in India
there will be no schools, aided or unaided,  for  students  to
attend. Only those students are called upon to leave Government
schools who consider it to be sinful to remain in them. The question
of returning to such schools does not arise in their case. And what
has my retirement to the mountains to do with the students’
withdrawal? Every student is expected to judge for himself what is
best for him and his country. The movement of self-government
cannot—must not—be made to depend upon one man. I have but
presented India with a new and matchless weapon, or rather an
extended application of an ancient and tried weapon. She must reject
or accept it for her own use. I cannot use it for her. I can use,
have used, it for myself and feel free. Others have done, and feel,
likewise. If the nation uses  the  weapon she becomes free.</p>

I am more than ever convinced that without the spinning-wheel the
problem of India’s poverty cannot be solved. Millions of India’s
peasants starve for want of supplementary occupation. If they have
spinning to add to their slender resources they can fight
successfully against pauperism and famine. Mills cannot solve the
problem. Only hand-spinning—and nothing else—can. When India was
forced to  give up hand-spinning, she had no other occupation  in 
return. Imagine what would happen to a man who found himself suddenly
deprived of a quarter of his bare livelihood. Over eighty-five per
cent of her population have more than a quarter of their time lying
idle. And, therefore, even apart from the terrible drain rightly
pointed out by the G. O. M.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
India, she has steadily grown poorer because of this enforced
idleness. The problem is how to utilize these billions of hours of
the nation without disturbing the rest. Restoration of the
spinning-wheel is the only possible answer. This has nothing to do
with my special views on machinery or with the boycott of foreign
goods in general. India is likely to accept the answer in full during
this year. It is madness to tinker with the problem. I am writing
this in Puri<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>in front of the murmuring waves. The picture of the
crowd of men, women and children with their fleshless ribs, under the
very shadow of Jagannath, haunts me. If I had the power, I would
suspend every other activity in schools and colleges, and everywhere
else, and popularize spinning; prepare out of these lads and lasses
spinning teachers; inspire every carpenter to prepare
spinning-wheels; and ask the teachers to take these life-giving
machines to every home, and teach them spinning. If I had the power,
I would stop an ounce of cotton from being exported and would have it
turned into yarn in these homes. I would dot India with depots for
receiving this yarn and distributing it among weavers. Given
sufficient steady and trained workers, I would undertake to drive
pauperism out of India during this year. This undoubtedly requires a
change in the angle of vision and in the national taste. I regard the

the nature of opiates to deaden our conscience. We must refuse to
wait for generations to furnish us with a patent solution of a
problem which is ever growing in seriousness. Nature knows, no mercy
in dealing stern justice. If we do not wake up before long, we shall
be wiped out of existence. I invite the sceptics to visit Orissa,
penetrate its villages, and find out for themselves where India
stands. They will then believe with me that to possess, or to wear,
an ounce of foreign cloth is a crime against India and humanity. I am
able to restrain myself from committing suicide by starvation only
because I have faith in India’s awakening, and her ability to put
herself on the way to freedom from this desolating pauperism. Without
faith in such a possibility I should cease to take interest in
living. I invite the ques- tioner, and every other intelligent lover
of his country, to take part in this privileged national service in
making spinning universal by introducing it in every home, and make
it profitable for the nation by helping to bring about a complete
boycott of foreign cloth during this year. I have finished the
questions and endeavoured to answer them. The most important from the
practical stand-point was the one regarding spinning. I hope I have
demonstrated the necessity of home-spinning as the only means of
dealing with India’s poverty. I know, however, that innumerable
difficulties face a worker in putting the doctrine into execution.
The most difficult, perhaps, is that of getting a proper wheel. Save
in the Punjab where the art is still alive, the difficulty is very
real. The carpenters have forgotten the cons- truction and the
innocent workers are at their wit’s end. The chief thing
undoubtedly, therefore, is for the worker to make himself acquainted
with the art and the handling of spinning-wheels. I lay down some
simple tests for testing them. No machine that fails to satisfy the
tests should be accepted or distributed.</p>

Mussulmans were who would rather quarrel amongst themselves and
retard the attainment of swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and
the Punjab wrongs. You claim to have an ancient town, and I hope that
you will not lag behind other parts of India and have it said of you
and against you that the Hindus and Mussulmans of Nellore cannot live
together as brothers. But many things interfered with my desire to
come here earlier than now. I have endeavoured to ascertain the cause
of the quarrel and you will forgive me for saying that the causes
were not worse than rupture between the two great communities. I
understand that the Mussulmans of Nellore, or let me put it,  the
majority of the Mussulmans of Nellore, would not allow the Hindus to
perform musical functions, to have musical processions passing by
their mosques. The Mohammedans contend that but a few years ago there
was no such demand made by the Hindu population. I have not known the
Hindu case. I have not come here to judge between my Hindu and
Mussulman brethren. But as an expert on Hindu and Muslim unity, I
propose in all humility to place, for your conside- ration and
acceptance, certain fundamental principles on which, and on which
alone, such a unity can remain everlasting. As a <i>Sanatana </i>Dharma
Hindu, feeling for my own faith, hoping that if the Faith was on its
trial, I would be found in the front rank to give my life for its
sake as a <i>Sanatani </i>Hindu, I wish first of all to address
myself to my Hindu brethren, and would say: ‘If you would live in
amity and friendship with the Mohammedan countrymen, the only way you
can do so is never on any account to put a strain upon their
religious fervour and always yield to them even though you may
consider that their demands are unreasonable and unjust. But there is
a condition attached to that submission even to unreasonable demands
and that condition is that their demands do not encroach upon the
vital part of your religious tenets.’ I will take a homely
illustration. If my Moham- medan countrymen demanded that I should
cease to go to my temple,  I would rather perish than concede that
demand in order to buy that friendship. Protection of the cow, I hold
as dear as life itself and if my Mussulman brother asked me to waive
protection of the cow, I again would perish rather than buy his
friendship with the blood of my cow. But when he tells me not to play
music past his mosque within a few yards, I would not condescend to
argue with him but immediately yield to him. Hindus may take it from
me that it is no  part,  no essential part, of Hinduism that we
should play music at any time. It is much less an essential part of
my religion that I should play music,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
instrumental or vocal, passing by a mosque. I would not hesitate to
agree to every such demand, to every such sentiment, to every such
prejudice of my Mohammedan brethren. And so, if I were a Hindu living
in Nellore, I would not even allow a case of this character to go to
arbitration; and only by agreeing with our Mussulman brethren on all
non-essentials and ceasing to subject them to pinpricks, we will be
able to keep their friendship for ever. And there can be no
bargaining in friendship. I yield to my Mussulman brethren in every
non-essen- tial, because it is natural for me to do so, because  my 
religion demands that I should live at peace with the whole world
even at the sacrifice of my life. And therefore, if the Hindus of
Nellore were to ask me what they should do because they consider that
the demand of the Mussulman brethren is unreasonable and unjust, I
would say: ‘Do not argue but yield to that unreasonable and unjust
demand.’ For if we were to engage in a discussion of such trivial
quarrels, the world will set us down as children unfit to govern
themselves, and you will, therefore, see quite clearly that it would
be relevant for the Hindus to tell me that such a thing is really the
case, that I have been misinformed, that only a few years ago the
Hindus never claimed to play music, passing by mosques. Such
pleasures of religious life— because I call these things pleasures,
agreeable pleasures—such pleasures of religious life I would hold
at the mercy, at the grace of my Mohammedan brethren. What is more,
you Hindus are probably 42 to 45 thousand in Nellore. Mussulmans are
but seven thousand. Hindus therefore as the elder brother are bound
to hold the Mussul- man interests as trustees. Your nobility or title
to swaraj demands that, as the stronger party, you should assume the
privilege of protecting the weak. To my Mohammedan brethren I would
urge: ‘Never think of making any unreasonable demands. Make it your
business to study the prejudices and sentiments of your  Hindu
brethren. Make allowances for what you may consider to be their
weaknesses. God will not hold you answerable on the Judgment Day if
He finds that you allowed yourself in your prayers in the mosque to
be interrupted by some music that you heard. I have not the shadow of
a doubt that God  Almighty  whom  you  call  also  Rahim<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  will  understand   your humble and gentle plea when
you tell Him on the Judgment Day that you could not help it, because
you wanted to respect your Hindu brothers’ prejudices. The test for
friendship, the test for brotherhood</p>

is that each party always makes allowances for the weaknesses of the
other and I know that on the Judgment Day that party will win the day
which will be able to show that it has always surrendered on
non-essentials. The life of the great Prophet is for you as a living
example of a perpetual surrender of non-essentials.’ But I say to
the Hindu and Mussulman brethren of Nellore, whether they can agree
about their differences or not, whether they can make concessions to
one another or not, whether they can come to an agreement on
essentials and non-essentials or not, it is not given to them, not to
a Jingle Hindu or to a single Mussulman to fly at each other’s
throats, to throw stones at one another, and to inflict violence on
one another. They must have trusted, chosen leaders of each community
to form a Board of Arbitration to settle all religious disputes
between the two, and if they are not satisfied, they can either go to
the Congress or to the Khilafat Committee for a settlement. And
finally I would repeat the advice that Maulana Shaukat Ali has been
giving times without number both to the Mussulmans and Hindus. When a
Mohammedan feels irritated and angry with his Hindu neighbours and
when he cannot restrain himself and feels that he must inflict
condign punish- ment on his Hindu brethren, then he must go to
Mahatma Gandhi and cut off his head. Similarly he advised the Hindus
that if  the Hindus felt irritated against the Mussulman neighbours
and wanted to pick a quarrel with them, they should not lay their
hands upon the Mussulman neighbours but they should go to Shaukat Ali
himself; although he is strong and burly, he makes that definite
promise that even a Hindu child may take his head from his shoulders.
Let Hindus and Mussulmans understand firmly that the cornerstone of
swaraj, the cornerstone of the freedom of India is Hindu and Muslim
unity. Let both understand that the defence of Islam with reference
to the Khilafat through the power of India is only possible if
Hindu-Muslim unity becomes a living factor in their life. Let Hindus
understand that their full contribution, their unconditional hearty
contribution to the defence of Islam automatically carries with it
the defence of Hinduism itself. And so my dear countrymen of Nellore,
I beseech both of you, whether you are Hindus or Mussulmans, sink
your petty differences, never quarrel again, make a firm
determination during the sacred week<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

It is time that you began to consider it to be a sin to wear an inch
of foreign cloth. Let the Mohammedans understand that the wearing of
foreign cloth is a badge of the degradation of Islam and let both
Hindus and Mussulmans understand that the wearing of foreign cloth is
a badge of our slavery. I would ask you not to fall back upon
Ahmedabad or Bombay for your clothes, but make it a point of honour
to become self-sustained by manufacturing all the cloth for your
local needs. Take it again from me, as an experienced spinner and
weaver, that it is entirely possible for the 52,000 men and women of
Nellore to produce all your cloth in the course of a month. Within
one night one weaver was able to produce sufficient cloth for me to
last for one year and that sacred cloth produced last night is in my

up to the profession made in your name and my name in that, this
battle of non-co-operation is a battle of self-purification. I would
ask you finally to remember that the National Week is not yet over.

As usual you will extend your forgiveness to me for my inabi- lity to
speak to you standing. You have just now witnessed the cere- mony of 
<i>Poornakumbham</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

the mission on which India has embarked may be successful. I am

this struggle Hindus and Mussulmans, Brahmins and non-Brahmins,
Christians, Parsis, Jews, all who claim this country as theirs are
united. But I wish to invite the attention of this meeting and of the
authors of this ceremony to the foreign touch that attached to that
ceremony. You saw the floral decoration surrounding the <i>Kumbham.
</i>It was of paper flowers. You might have noticed also the garment
in which the <i>Kumbham </i>was wrapped; it was foreign cloth. I hope
that it is time India will recognize that foreign cloth is a badge of
our slavery, that foreign cloth is a badge of the degradation of
Islam</p>

political, moral, religious—the more I think of the Khilafat
question, the more I am convinced that if the Khilafat wrong is to be
redressed through India, through the Hindus and Mussulmans of India,
if India is to gain swaraj during this year, at least we owe it to
the motherland that we discard the use of foreign cloth, no matter at
what cost. As Maulana Mahomed Ali in one of his recent speeches in
Calcutta remarked: “A hundred years ago or more we sold away the
spinning-wheel and we purchased our slavery.” And I want therefore
to invite your attention to the most potent part of the resolution
arrived at by the All-India Congress Committee<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

so many months.</p>

If we want one crore of rupees before the 30th June, we want it not
in order to promote deputations to England or America or any part of
the world, not for any foreign propaganda, but we want that money and
more for introducing the spinning-wheel into every home in India. We
want that money in order to pay a mere livelihood to the workers who
will come out throughout the length and breadth of Dravid land<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

was in Masulipatam and I had the honour of visiting a few villages
where even today our sisters are spinning beautiful fine yarn not for
money but for love. (Cheers.) I therefore hope that if you are going
to be instrumental in attaining swaraj during this year, in
redressing the Khilafat wrong and the Punjab wrong, you will make
during this sacred National Week a fixed derermination to throw away
all the foreign cloth that you may possess. I hold it to be a crime
to see an inch of foreign cloth in our temples, in our mosques. But I
must pass on to some other topics.</p>

I am glad to note that the more we progress the more convinced our
countrymen are that the success of our battle depends mainly, if not
solely; upon non-violence. In my opinion our non-violence is the
greatest part of our non-co-operation. But our non-violence will have
to stand the severest stress and the greatest strain that might be
put upon it. I have just heard that somewhere in Malabar a

his son by some policemen. I shall still hope that the story is

brought the thing to my notice. But let us understand that such a
thing is not impossible under this Government or for that matter any
other Government. (Laughter.) We had too much of it at the time of
the Martial Law in the Punjab two years ago. The greatest time of our
triumph will be only when we can stand the tortures without returning
any violence whatsoever. This Government must either repent of the
wrongs, the violent wrongs done to India, or it must hold India by a
system of terrorism. It was only when I came to the conclusion that
Dyerism, O’Dwyerism, was not an isolated phenomenon, but that it
was a settled policy of the Government bent upon holding India at any
cost that I called it a Satanic system of Government. But to
non-co-operators there is only one road left open and that is to turn
the searchlight inward, to purify ourselves, to exercise the greatest
restraint under the gravest provocation. Therefore, I ask fathers of
boys who are doing any non-co-operation work and I ask
non-co-operators themselves who are actively engaged in propaganda to
understand that if they continue this work they should do so knowing
that they might be subjected to violence and even then they ought not
to retort. If India can only exercise self-restraint during this year
of probation, of purification for her, I assure you I can see nothing
that can prevent our onward march and establishment of  swaraj in
India during this year. If you believe in God—and no non-cooperator
can be a real non-co-operator who does not believe in God—if you
believe in God during this week of prayer, of purifi- cation and
sacrifice, you will concentrate your prayer to God that He may give
every one of us, the whole of India, the power to bear all violence
that this Government make use of and subject us to.</p>

It is infinitely more necessary that we non-co-operators control our
speech, control our movements and free them even from any danger or
any smell of violence. Let our speech and our pen be free of any
violent thing. If we would but continue along this course of
purification, to use an expression of the late President Kruger, we
shall stagger humanity during this year. For what is it that we have
seen in the repression, not merely in the Madras Presidency, but in
the Central Provinces, in the United Provinces and other parts of
India? In spite of the denial of Sir William Vincent I am here to say
that the temperance crusade in the Central Provinces has become a
crime, and when they talk of putting down non-co-operation by all
possible means, they talk of putting down home-spinning, putting down
the teetotalism. We are showing step by step through the course of
our self-purification that</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
this Government can hold India in bondage only on the strength of its
<i>Abakari </i>revenue, only on the strength of the exploitation of
India through Lancashire. Therefore I would urge every one of you to
sterilise the activity of this Government by showing to the whole of
India, by showing to the Moderates and the Liberal party that when
they associate with this Government and support the policy of repre-
ssion inaugurated by this Government they do not want non-co-ope-
rationists to carry on the campaign of temperance, to carry the 
message of goodwill, the message of happiness and the message of
chastity of the womanhood of India which the spinning-wheel carried.

The Hindu-Muslim disunion, the Hindu-Muslim quarrels, no longer
supply food for this Government. (Laughter.) Now this Government, I
see and understand, is trading upon  the disunion between Brahmins
and non-Brahmins. (Cheers.) If this Non-co-ope- ration Movement is a
Brahmin movement, and I hope it is a Brahmin movement, the remedy is
incredibly simple, because the Brahmins want no loaves and fishes, if
they are non-co-operators. But let us make haste to patch up quarrels
as we have patched up the Hindu-Muslim quarrel amongst ourselves. I
wish to repeat what I said to a select audience of lawyers some time
ago in Madras. I have not a shadow of doubt that Hinduism owes its
all to the great traditions that the Brahmins have left for Hinduism.
They have left a legacy for India, for which every Indian, no matter
to what <i>varna </i>he may belong, owes a deep debt of gratitude.
Having studied the history of almost every religion in the world it
is my settled conviction that there is no class in the world that has
accepted poverty and self-effacement as its lot. I would therefore
urge—a non-Brahmin myself—I would urge all non-Brahmins who may
compose the audience and all non-Brahmins to whom my voice may reach
that they will make a fundamental error if they believe that they can
better their position by decrying Brahminism. Even in this black age,
travelling throughout the length and breadth of India, I notice that
the Brahmins take the first place in self-sacrifice and
self-effacement. It is the Brahmins all over India who silently but
surely are showing to every class in India their rights and
privileges. But having said so much I wish to confess too that the
Brahmins together with the rest of us have suffered of all [<i>sic</i>]<i>.</i><i>
</i>They</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
have set before India, voluntarily and  deliberately,  the  highest
standard that the human mind is capable of conceiving; and they must
not be surprised if the Indian world exact that standard from them.
The Brahimins have declared themselves, and they ought to remain,
custodians of the purity of our life. I am aware that the
non-Brahmins of Madras have many things to say against Brahmins, for
which there is some cause. But let non-Brahmins realize that by
quarrelling with Brahmins, by being jealous of them and by
mud-slinging they will not better their lot, but will degrade
Hinduism itself. I hold that it behoves non-Brahmins, shrewd as they
are, to understand the beauty and secret of this movement. This
movement is specially designed to dethrone insolence of office. He
who has eyes may see what is happening in India today is a process
not of levelling down but of levelling up. Let non-Brahmins beware of
attempting to rise upon the ashes of Brahminism. And, therefore, I
would urge non-Brahmins, if they can- not throw themselves heart and
soul into this movement, at least to refrain from interfering with
this movement by intriguing with the Government.</p>

Non-co-operation in the language of medicine is a kind of aseptic
treatment. Antiseptics are necessary only when we first gather dirt
and we want to introduce other germs to destroy that dirt; but
aseptic treatment presupposes purity from within. Our non-co-oper-
ation with the Government, therefore, simply means we have done away
with dirt and uncleanliness. We do not want to pretend to have
dispelled darkness by making darkness deeper. We do not want to meet
or neutralize violence of the Government by greater violence on our
part. Our swaraj must not consist of exploitation of any human being
on earth. I therefore urge you simply to concentrate your attention
upon the three things that the All-India Congress Committee have
placed before you. I would like you never to give the slightest
excuse to the Government for imprisoning us in regard to our
speeches. But I would leave open the gates of prison without a drop
of tear from my eyes and send the whole of the womanhood of India to
prisons for possessing the spinning-wheel. Let us not be impatient
either with the Government or with our friends who are opposed to us
today. Rather let us be impatient with ourselves. All our speeches
and all our resolutions are now mostly, or should be, addressed to
ourselves. And if we can only carry through the simple programme that
is mapped out by the Congress, by the Khilafat Committee and by the
Muslim League, I repeat my conviction that swaraj we shall attain and
the Khilafat wrong and the Punjab wrong we shall redress during this
year.</p>

At the time of the famine in Orissa, I realized the poverty of the
province but my impression has been that nowhere else were the people
likely to be so poor as in Champaran<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. But I am afraid Orissa beats Champaran in this
respect. The difference between the two is that in Champaran the
ryots had been impoverished by the oppression of the indigo-planters,
whereas in Orissa the suffering is due to the wrath of Nature. Either
the crops do not grow through lack of rains or there are floods
following excessive rains and the crops and houses are washed off,
hence there is always a near-famine in this province.</p>

In this godforsaken region, the one real leader is Gopabandhu Das,

Gopabandhu Das became a lawyer and practised for a few years, but

non-co-operation resolution, Gopabandhu Babu did away with the
Government control. Some pupils left the school in  consequence,

the shade of trees. Among the crafts, the chief is carpentry. Now
spinning and weaving have been added. Gopabandhu Babu was a member of

the start of non-co-operation. They go begging handfuls of rice, and
in this way a Swaraj Ashram has also been established. The diet of
these members and of the pupils consists mainly of rice, dal and oil
or a few drops of ghee with vegetables, when available. Their monthly
expenses come to seven or eight rupees. Formerly they used to have
some ghee but have stopped it after non-co-operation started. There
will hardly be any other body in the country today kept alive with so
much voluntary suffering. When I asked whether this poor diet would
not affect their health, Gopabandhu Babu’s reply was: “Should we
not submit to this privation for the sake of swaraj ?” I was
silenced. When a man is faced with suffering, one knows not how but

The garments in which the images are draped are of foreign cloth! Why
so much ignorance and utter thoughtlessness? For the garments of

into cloth. Cloth made otherwise was considered unholy. I was lost in

With this holy thought revolving in my mind, I went to pay a visit to
a home for destitutes started by Lala Amichand, the police chief of
Puri. Victims of famine have been brought here and are being taught
to make mats and foot-rugs, and also to spin and weave. Spinning and
weaving were introduced after the swadeshi and the non-co-operation
movements started. I could see from this that the statement that
spinning is an insurance against famine was no exaggeration at all. I
had a talk with the leaders on this matter and a resolution was
passed to the effect that the balance in the Puri Relief Fund should
be used to provide victims of the famine with spinning-wheels in
their homes.</p>

Today is the last day of the sacred week. Those who believe in God
should make it a point to keep a fast and offer prayers on this day.
It is the earnest desire of my heart that this should turn out to be
the last 13th of April to see us in a state of subjection. But it is
not in my hands to bring this about, and not in God’s either. Even
God will not grant us swaraj. It is for us to win it and there is
only one way of doing so. The moment we understand what it is and
follow it, swaraj will be ours. We want to see foreign cloth
boycotted in the course of this very year. To ensure this, everyone
should examine his person and his wardrobe and should forthwith
renounce the use of foreign cloth. No one must ask what others do. We
should learn to make do with the fewest clothes, should ourselves ply
the spinning wheel and urge others to do likewise.</p>

suspend Non-co-operation, so as to give Lord Reading<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

atmosphere to prevent a study of the situation. In the second place,
what disturbance there is, is either fomented by the authorities, or
the situation is so mishandled as to give rise to bloodshed. In the
Central Provinces the Government are foisting the drink traffic on a
public that is enraged against it. Of Rae Bareilly, not having read
newspapers, I have not sufficient data to be able to say anything. In
any case, Mr. Riza Ali should address his appeal to the permanent
officials who are provoking the people and creating alarm in the
country. Thirdly, it is not within the power of any one man, even if

mean by suspension of non-co-operation? Should the title-holders
temporarily recall their titles, the lawyers resume practice, the
schoolboys return to Government schools, the spinners put away their
spinning-wheels, carpenters cease making new wheels, and tipplers
renew their acquaintance with the publicans? Does Mr. Riza Ali desire
that national schools should for the time being close their doors?
Unthinkable as it may seem, it is evident that Mr. Riza Ali does not
understand the scope of non-co-operation, he does not realize that it
is like a virtue whose practice cannot be suspended at will. If
English- men mean well by India, if Englishmen, who are dependent
upon India for their maintenance, will be true to their salt, they
must be reconciled to the abolition of the drink traffic and the
total destruc- tion of the traffic in foreign cloth and, therefore,
also  Lancashire cloth. Even when the Khilafat is fully protected, 
and  the  Punjab wound healed, the drink revenue cannot be revived
nor the use of foreign cloth resumed. What surprises one is that
there are intelligent and educated public workers in the country who
do not see that this Government must proceed from wrong to wrong, so
long as it does not cleanse itself of the original sins. No doubt
itcan, if it will, even without redressing the two wrongs, co-operate
with the people in the two great dynamic movements—the battle
against the drink evil and reinstatement of the spinning-wheel in all
its ancient dignity  and purity. It will then break the edge of the
two wrongs. Such a co-operation by the Government with the people
will, however, increase the capacity of the people to ensure
rectification of the two wrongs, and for that very reason the
Government will not allow the peaceful progress of the drink campaign
and boycott of foreign cloth by increased home-manufacture through
the spinning-wheel.</p>

These were the words in which Mr. Das summed  up  the All-India
Congress Committee’s resolution about one crore members, one crore
rupees, and twenty lakhs of spinning-wheels. This  programme is
neither elaborate nor intricate. It requires practically no
sacrifice. It does require organization, will, and industry. We have
twenty-one Congress provinces, and, happily, each province has
workers capable of organizing their respective provinces for the
Congress programme. I would strongly advise them to devote them-
selves to the work of registering members, collecting subs-criptions,
and introducing spinning-wheels. Let the workers remember that there</p>

is no time to lose. We must be able to reach every adult male and
female in our respective provinces and give them a chance of coming
to the Congress register. We must give a chance even to boys and
girls of understanding to subscribe to the Tilak Memorial Swaraj
Fund, and take to every family the life-giving message of the
spinning-wheel. The poorest province need not feel any doubt about
its ability to cope with its share of the programme. Orissa is, I
believe the poorest province. I asked the workers there whether they
would shoulder their share of the burden. They agreed, nor was there
any need for them to hesitate with the Lord of the Universe having
his seat in Orissa.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>They
could collect their quota, if it came to the worst, from the pilgrims

approached. But our hope must centre in the pies of the poor rather
than upon windfalls from single places. Nothing gave me greater
confidence and greater hope than the sight of  thousands  of  the 
verypoor  men  at  Sakhigopal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

The Biharis are even collecting <i>muthis</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4

I suggest workers meeting the heads of all the artisan classes. We
want carpenters, blacksmiths, washer men, masons, scavengers, shoe
makers, tanners, etc., to understand and take part in this movement.
They do not need any previous training in schools to appreciate the
necessity of swaraj. They easily understand the intimate connection
between swaraj and the spinning-wheel. With our existing caste
organizations, which are really trade guilds, we should have no
difficulty in reaching the majority of the men and women who are
members of these important organizations.</p>

It should further be remembered that both men and money are wanted
for one purpose, to manufacture and distribute munitions, i.e.,
spinning-wheels. We must bring about complete boycott of foreign
cloth during this year, and if possible before the end of July next.
One crore of rupees and twenty lakhs of spinning wheels is the
minimum aimed at by the Congress. It does not include the
spinning-wheels that were already working before the 31st December
last. Of coarse counts</p>

we require 6 Ibs. of cloth per head per year. We, therefore, need
1,800 million pounds per year for the nation. In order to manufacture
this quantity of cloth in a year, of say three hundred working days,
and if a spindle give _ lb. per day i.e. 150 Ibs. per year, we
require 12 million spindles. What the Congress expects by the end of
June is 2 million or a sixth of the total requirement. It is not an
extravagant presumption to make that if we succeed in introducing two
million spinning wheels during three months, the momentum received by
the movement will double the number of wheels during the next three
months without much effort. We have probably fifty million families
in India counting six members for a family. The problem, therefore,
is one of only reaching two million out of this large number of
families. If the existing workers have the faith that I have in the
spinning-wheel, they will do well to learn spinning and understand
the structure of a spinning-wheel so as to be able to distinguish a
good wheel from a bad one. They must not on any account introduce a

will produce less impression, if any at all, if they do not

A newspaper, I am told, has put the question as to what the Congress
will do with its crore. The natural answer is for the use stated in
the Congress resolution, i.e., for the attainment of swaraj through
non-violent non-co-operation. The only activity involving financial
obligations is that of spinning, organizing national service, in some
cases supporting lawyers, who might have suspended practice and
cannot be included in the national service, and for supporting
national educational institutions. The latter three, however, really
bear again on spinning. For all the workers and all the schools and
colleges must be mainly occupied in promoting hand-spinning and
hand-weaving if we are to achieve a complete boycott of foreign goods
before the end of the year. These are the only uses that I can
conceive in connection with the All-India Tilak Memorial Swaraj Fund.
Seventy-five per cent of the funds are to be controlled by the
provinces collecting them.</p>

There is a homely proverb in Gujarati which means, a noted banker
continually adds to his wealth, as a notorious criminal conti- nually
comes in for undeserved blame. Whether I am to be regarded as a
reformer or a criminal, the situations I find myself in are most
curious and often embarrassing. The people credit me with super-
natural powers when the only powers I have are derived from my
scrupulous  regard  for  truth,  an  unquenchable  industry,  fair  
play to opponents, readiness always to admit mistakes, and an
incessant appeal to reason. But the simple-minded masses will not
believe me when I tell them I possess no extraordinary powers.
Similarly those who are not accustomed to absolutely honest dealings 
in  politics persist in crediting me with all kinds of wickedness.
The <i>Morning </i><i>Post </i>believes that the strike in Fiji was
due to the efforts of a sadhu sent there by me. Now I do not knowwho
the alleged sadhu is. I have certainly sent no one to Fiji to advise
a strike. At the same time the strike having been declared in Fiji,
the strikers have my sympathy. All the evidence in my possession
shows that Fiji is a huge exploitation camp in which the poor Indian
labourers are used by the sugar-plan- ters for their fabulous
profits.</p>

Somewhat similar to the misconceptions I have alluded to is that of
<i>The Times of India, </i>to whose two recent articles a friend has
drawn my attention. Not being able to read newspapers regularly, I do
not know how much more I must be misrepresented by other journals,
when <i>The Times of India</i>, which is supposed to know me better,
I hope, innocently misunderstands me. One article credits me with
having suspended non-co-operation in that I advised the All-India
Congress Committee to concentrate on men, money, and the
spinning-wheel. I fear I cannot take the credit, for I have not
advised suspension, and I have already shown in answer to Mr. Riza
Ali how it cannot be suspended. In the other article brought to my
notice, I am not now ‘the Mr. Gandhi of old’ and, therefore, the

I see not only no defeat so far but I am amazed  at  the  awakening
among the people. I hold that it is a great thing to have created a
strong public opinion against the institutions on which a Government
builds its credit. <i>The Times of </i><i>India </i>considers
non-co-operation ‘to be an easy descent to hell.’ I respectfully
urge that it is a difficult ascent to heaven. If it was a movement to
produce anarchy, surely it could be precipitated any moment. <i>The
</i><i>Times </i><i>of </i><i>India </i>and other critics who, I
believe, are anxious to understand the inwardness of the struggle,
will do well to appreciate the fact that not only I but <i>all </i>the
leaders are doing their utmost to prevent anarchy. It is no use
isolating me from the rest. The critics who continue to suspect the
Ali Brothers do themselves and the cause a great injustice. The
Brothers’ position is perfectly dear and intelligible. To them
violence is lawful under given circumstances. As Maulana Mahomed Ali
often puts it, war is bad but there are worse things than war. The
British Government has no two opponents more honourable than the
Brothers. They mean no ill in a spirit of wantonness. They are
honestly and industriously endeavouring to secure a peaceful settle-
ment. But should their effort prove vain, either for want of response
from the Government or the people, as lovers of their faith, they
will not hesitate to precipitate war if they could. I refuse to be
considered so simple as to be readily taken in by my companions. I
believe my companions to be incapable of deceiving me. I believe them
to be godfearing, brave, and honourable men, whose association I
prize as a privilege. As for my own attitude, whilst my faith would
not permit me to invite or encourage a war of violence, I do
contemplate with equanimity a state of war in preference to the
present state of effeminate peace imposed by force of arms. And it is
for that reason that I am taking part in this movement of non-violent
non-coope- ration even at the risk of anarchy being the ultimate
result. The critics of non-co-operation might, if they will, see in
everyone an intense desire to prevent anarchy and bloodshed. In any
case, whether non-co-operators are understood or not, they cannot
afford to lose patience. They must continue to walk along the chosen
and narrow path.</p>

A flag is a necessity for all nations. Millions have died for it. It
is no doubt a kind of idolatry which it would be a sin to destroy.
For a flag represents an ideal. The unfurling of the Union Jack

Mr. P. Venkayya of the National College, Masulipatam, has for some
years placed before the public a suggestive booklet describing the
flags of the other nations and offering designs for an Indian
National Flag. But, whilst I have always admired the persistent zeal
with which Mr. Venkayya has prosecuted the cause of a national flag
at every session of the Congress for the past four years, he was
never able to enthuse me; and in his designs I saw nothing to stir
the nation to its depths. It was reserved for a Punjabi to make a
suggestion that at once arrested attention. It was Lala Hansraj of
Jullunder who, in discussing the possibilities of the spinning-wheel,
suggested that it should find a place on our Swaraj Flag. I could not
help admiring the originality of the suggestion. At Bezwada I asked
Mr. Venkayya to give me a design containing a spinning-wheel on a red
(Hindu colour)</p>

and green (Muslim colour) background.  His enthusiastic  spirit
enabled me to possess a flag in three hours. It was just a little
late for presentation to the All-India Congress Committee. I am glad
it was so. On maturer consideration, I saw that the background should
represent the other religions also. Hindu-Muslim unity is not an
exclusive term; it is an inclusive term, symbolic of the unity of all
faiths domiciled in India. If Hindus and Muslims can tolerate each
other,  they  are  together bound to tolerate all other faiths. The
unity is not a menace to the other faiths represented in India or to
the world. So I suggest that the background should be white and green
and red. The white portion is intended to represent all other faiths.
The weakest numeri- cally occupy the first place, the Islamic colour
comes next, the Hindu colour red comes last, the idea being that the
strongest should act as a shield to the weakest. The white colour
moreover represents purity and peace. Our national flag must mean
that or nothing. And to represent the equality of the least of us
with the best, an equal part is assigned to all the three colours in
the design.</p>

But India as a nation can live and die only for the spinning wheel.
Every woman will tell the curious that with the disappearance of the
spinning-wheel, vanished India’s happiness and prosperity. The
womanhood and the masses of India have been awakened as never before
at the call of the spinning-wheel. The masses recognize in it the
giver of life. The women regard it as the protector of their
chastity. Every widow I have met has recognized in the wheel a dear
forgotten friend. Its restoration alone can fill the millions of
hungry mouths. No industrial development schemes can solve the
problem of the growing poverty of the peasantry of India covering a
vast surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 broad. India is not a small
island, it is a big continent which cannot be converted like England
into an industrial country. And we must resolutely set our face
against any scheme  of exploitation of the world. Our only hope must
centre upon utilizing the wasted hours of the nation, for adding to
the wealth of the country by converting cotton into cloth in our
cottages. The spinning-wheel is, therefore, as much a necessity of
Indian life as air and water.</p>

It follows that the flag must be made of <i>khaddar, </i>for it is 
through coarse cloth alone that we can make India independent of
foreign markets for her cloth. I would advise all religious organiza-

flags, as for instance the Khilafat, a miniature National Flag in the
upper left hand corner. The regulation size of the Flag should
contain the drawing of a full-sized spinning-wheel.</p>

I was prepared to see skeletons in Orissa but not to the extent I
did. I had seen terrible pictures but the reality was too terrible.
What can be the meaning of swaraj to these men, women and children,
who were merely skin and bone and who lined a road in holy Puri on
that memorable 26th day of March? They were not one or two, but many,
and yet they were not all. They were the ablest of the starving those
who were able to walk fairly long distances. They had come to see one
who had sent them rice and from whom they expected more. They cried,
and they said in pathetic tones, ‘we want food.’ Some said, ‘when
will the prices be reduced?’ I understood that the meaning of
swaraj to many was cheap food and clothing,—the latter not so much.
A rag sufficed to cover their lower limbs. But food they must have.</p>

They took me to an <i>anathalaya—</i>a home for orphans. It was
established by a humane superintendent of police. I saw there well-
looking boys and girls—some spinning and some mat making. Why could
  not   all   the   Fleshless   ones   do   likewise?    They    need
not then live on begging, the house-leavings, or a handful of rice.
They  could  earn   their   own   living   if   only   they   could  
spin. But who would give them the  wheels?  Straight  came the 
answer: ‘The Congress of course.’ The Congress could teach them
to gain swaraj through spinning. There is no other occupation that
millions can take up, not even mat-making. For millions of mats will
not sell. Yarn is the only commodity next to eatables that would have
a ready market. I met the Congress leaders. I recited the story to
them. Some of them were witnesses with me of the scenes I have
described. They agreed that the Congress funds must be utilized
chiefly for the spread of the spinning-wheel. And the money they
could easily get from <i>mahants </i>and and the pilgrims. The
Congress Committee even in poor Orissa could thus be self-supporting

ornaments. It is fatal to show those ornaments to me. I made no

return to the bungalow at about 9 p.m. I had a visit from some women
and girls. The light was very dim as I entered. There was something
uncanny about their movements and their looks. Somehow or other the
usual greeting, “Do you spin? What will you give me for the Tilak
Swaraj Fund?” would not come to my lips. On the contrary, I asked
my host who the ladies were. He did not know. He inquired, and after
some hesitation the answer came, “We are dancing girls.” I felt
like sinking into the bowels of the earth. My host soothed me by
saying that there was a ceremony attached to the commencement of
life. It made matters worse for me. It gave the damnable thing an air
of respecta-bility. I cross-examined. They said in the politest tones
they had come to have  <i>darshan.  </i>“Will you<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>take  up  some  other  occu- pation?” “Yes, if it
gives us our livelihood.” I had not the heart to close with them
there and then. I felt ashamed of my sex. I spoke straight the next
morning at Rajahmundry, the next halting place. It was the one most
painful experience in Andhra. I suppose the sin is common enough in
one shape or another in the rest of India. All I can say is that, if
we will have swaraj through self-purification, we may not make women
a prey to our lust. The law of the protection of the weak applies
here with peculiar force. To me the meaning of cow protection
includes the protection of the chastity of our women. We will not
have a regenerate India unless we learn to respect our women as we
respect our mothers, sisters and daughters. Let us cleanse ourselves
of the sins that kill the man in us and make us brute.</p>

Spinning is a visible, sacred symbol of national purity, strength,
and prosperity. It is a duty enjoined upon all, whether Hindu or
Muslim, Christian, Jew, or Parsi. The Andhra National College is an
old institution of which the Andhras have every reason to be proud.
It is an institution which is a produce of the-Ben- gal awakening of
1907 and has weathered many a storm. I hope that it will emerge from
the present awakening a purer and stronger body. It certainly
possesses all the material for becoming a centre, radiating the
purest activity in keeping with the present spirit.</p>

remains that even if the so-called major provinces fall, in the event
of terrorism (as distinguished from repression) commencing, Bihar and
Andhra will save the situation by outdoing the Sikhs in the bravery
of the soul, i.e., suffering. I may be wrong in my estimate. Let us
all strive to outdo the rest. It is a race in which competition is

Of an experiment in civil disobedience forced on two beautiful
villages and their leader, I must write on another occasion. I must
also deal another time with the Hindu-Muslim problem of Nellore. I
must close these impressions by noting with gratefulness the fact
that in a neighbouring village near a spinning and weaving Ashram<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>conducted by Mr. Hanamantrao and his associates, the
Brahmin villagers invited me to walk through their village although I
was accompanied by <i>Panchama </i>associates. It was a village whose
Brahmin street had never before had <i>Panchamas </i>walking through
it.</p>

We are no longer fighting for mere righting of the Khilafat and the
Punjab wrongs. We want swaraj which should be <i>Ramarajya. </i>This
<i>Rakshasrajya </i>means continuation of terror and exploitation of
the weak. This <i>Ramarajya </i>we want to achieve by
self-purification. Prayers must have gone out from us during the
National Week  to  instil feelings of justice and mercy in us and to
give us power to non-co-operate with vice and to keep us away from
violence and anger. We have conducted vigorously our campaigns with
regard to withdrawal from Government schools and courts, but we must
at times cry halt. We have done what we could for students and
pleaders. To work any more for them means economically a waste of
time. We must now turn to our body; we must clothe it in swadeshi
garments and for that we must take to spinning. It is no sacrifice,
because it means saving of 60 crore rupees every year to India. So
long as I see a single individual clothed in foreign material, the

I regard untouchability as the greatest blot on Hinduism. This idea
was not brought home to me by my bitter experiences during the
S[outh] African struggle. It is  not  due  to  the  fact  that  I 
was once an agnostic. It is equally wrong to think—as some people
do— that I have taken my views from my study of Christian religious
literature. These views date as far back as the time when I was
neither enamoured of, nor was acquainted with, the Bible or the
followers of the Bible.</p>

I was hardly yet twelve when this idea had dawned on me. A scavenger
named Uka, an untouchable, used to attend our house for cleaning
latrines. Often I would ask my mother why it was wrong to touch him,
why I was forbidden to touch him. If I  accidentally touched Uka, I
was asked to perform the ablutions, and though I naturally obeyed, it
was not without smilingly protesting that untouchability was not
sanctioned by religion, that it was impossible that it should be so.
I was a very dutiful and obedient child and so far as it was
consistent with respect for parents, I often had tussles with them on
this matter. I told my mother that she was entirely wrong in
considering physical contact with Uka as sinful.</p>

While at school I would often happen to touch the ‘untouch- ables’,
and as I never would conceal the fact from my parents, my mother
would tell me that the shortest cut to purification after the unholy
touch was to cancel the touch by touching any Mussulman passing by.
And simply out of reverence and regard for   my mother I often did
so, but never did so believing it to be a religious obli- gation.
After some time we shifted to Porbandar, where I made my first
acquaintance with Sanskrit. I was not yet put into an English school,
and my brother and I were placed in charge of a Brahmin who taught us

suggested that I should mutter the Texts whenever I was afraid, and
all evil spirits would fly away. This I did and, as I thought, with
good effect. I could never believe then that there was any text in
the <i>Ramaraksha </i>pointing to the conduct of the ‘untouchables’
as a sin. I did not understand its meaning then, or understood it
very imper- fectly. But I was confident that <i>Ramaraksha. </i>which
could destroy all fear of ghosts, could not be countenancing any such
thing as fear of contact with the ‘untouchables’.</p>

The <i>Ramayana </i>used to be regularly read in our family. A
Brahmin called Ladha Maharaj used to read it. He was stricken with
leprosy, and he was confident that a regular reading of the <i>Ramayana
</i>would cure him of leprosy, and indeed, he was cured of it. `How
can the <i>Ramayana,’ </i>I thought to myself, ‘in which one who
is regarded nowadays as an untouchable took Rama across the Ganges in
his boat, countenance the idea of any human beings being
‘untouchables’ on the ground that they were polluted souls?’
The fact that we addressed God as the ‘purifier of the polluted’
and by similar appellation, shows that it is a sin to regard anyone
born in Hinduism as polluted or untouchable— that it is Satanic to
do so. I have hence been never tired of repeating that it is a great
sin. I do not pretend that this thing had crystalized as a conviction
in me at the age of twelve, but I do say that  I did then regard
untouchability as a sin. I narrate this story for the information of
the <i>Vaishnavas </i>and orthodox Hindus:</p>

I have always claimed to be a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu. It is not that I
am quite innocent of the scriptures. I am not a profound scholar of
Sanskrit. I have read the Vedas and the Upanishads only in trans-
lations. Naturally therefore mine is not a scholarly study of them.
My knowledge of them is in no way profound, but I have studied them
as  I should do as a Hindu and I claim to have grasped their true
spirit. By the time I had reached the age of 21, I had studied other
religions also.</p>

There was a time when I was wavering between Hinduism and
Christianity. When I recovered my balance of mind, I felt that to me
salvation was possible only through the Hindu religion and my faith
in Hinduism grew deeper and more enlightened.</p>

the shastras. It might be difficult for me to establish my point by
quoting authorities from the  <i>Bhagavat</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

understood the spirit of Hinduism. Hinduism has sinned in giving
sanction to untouchability. It has degraded us, made us the pariahs
of the Empire. Even the Mussulmans caught the sinful contagion from
us, and in S[outh] Africa, in E[ast] Africa and in Canada, the
Mussulmans no less than Hindus came to be regarded as pariahs. All
this evil has resulted from the sin of untouchability.</p>

I may here recall my proposition,  which  is  this:  So  long  as the
Hindus wilfully regard untouchability as part of their religion, so
long as the mass of Hindus consider it a sin to touch a section of
their brethren, swaraj is impossible of attainment. Yudhishthira
would not enter heaven without his dog. How can, then, the
descendants of that Yudhishthira expect to obtain swaraj without the
untouchables? What crimes for which we condemn the Government as
Satanic have not we been guilty of towards our untouchable brethren?</p>

We are guilty of having suppressed our brethren; we make them crawl
on their bellies; we have made them rub their noses on the ground;
with eyes red with rage, we push them out of railway
compartments—what more than this has British Rule done? What charge
that we bring against Dyer and O’Dwyer may not others, and even our
own people, lay at our door? We ought to purge ourselves of this
pollution. It is idle to talk of swaraj so long as we-do not protect
the weak and the helpless, or so long as it is possible for a single
swarajist to injure the feelings of any individual. Swaraj means that
not   a single Hindu or Muslim shall for a moment arrogantly think
that he can crush with impunity meek Hindus or Muslims. Unless this
condi- tion is fulfilled we will gain swaraj only to lose it the next
moment. We are no better than the brutes until we have purged
ourselves of the sins we have committed against our weaker brethren.</p>

But I have faith in me still. In the course of my peregrinations in
India I have realized that the spirit of kindness of which the poet
Tulsidas sings so eloquently, which forms the cornerstone of the Jain
and <i>Vaishnava </i>religions, which is the quintessence of the
<i>Bhagavat</i>. and which every verse of the <i>Gita </i>is
saturated with—this kindness, this love, this charity, is slowly
but steadily gaining ground in the hearts of the masses of this

Many a fracas between Hindus and Mussulmans is still heard of. There
are still many of those who do not scruple to  wrong  one another.
But as to the net result, I feel that kindness and charity have
increased. The Hindus and Mohammedans have become godfearing. We have
shaken ourselves free from the hypnotism of law courts and Government
schools and no longer labour under any other halluci- nation. I have
also realized that those whom we regard as illiterate and ignorant
are the very people who deserve to be called educated. They are more
cultured than we, their lives are more righteous than ours. A little
study of the present-day mentality of the people will show that
according to the popular conception swaraj is synonymous with
<i>Ramarajya</i>—the establishment of the Kingdom of Righteousness
on earth.</p>

formerly. That does not mean that I expect you to cease to have

mistrusted having wronged you so much? Swami Vivekanand used to say

    </font></sup>I did not succeed in my aim, but now there is
awakening here. The first mark of awakening is that we should have
developed the power of organizing meetings and of controlling
processions. That requires training. Just as a fire or a waterfall
cannot be utilized unless skilfully controlled, so awakening too is
useless without discipline. The first mark of awakening is that,
wherever we are, we should understand our duty.</p>

For me, there can be decorations, presents and medals of khadi alone.
The thing I have been given, however, is no sign of swaraj. One can
see in this why we do not get swaraj this very day. You have elected
as your president a man who calls himself a farmer and a weaver, and
now a <i>Bhangi </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>;
and you have given him  this  purse! There is no weight in it either
of paper [i.e., currency notes] or silver or gold. You have given me
just an empty purse; and a still greater crime is that it is all made
of foreign material.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

in it is foreign. Then what is swadeshi in it? I claim to be a leader
of the swadeshi movement and I should know what is swadeshi and what
is not swadeshi. The beauty of my defini-tion of swadeshi is that if
we follow such swadeshi, nobody can prevail over us. Swadeshi for
Halol is what is made in Halol itself. Anything made anywhere else in
India must be unacceptable to it. We, all of us, should be
self-sufficient and should compete for the first place. We shall get
swaraj when we vie with one another with ever greater vigour in this
matter. This is the key to swaraj.</p>

I cannot bear to see the decorations here in the town. Not even an
inch of foreign cloth should be used in them. Instead, such cloth is
hung up all round. All the flags and buntings are of foreign stuff.
Their dyes are all foreign.Understand, therefore, that these
decorations are no better than rags. Since one puts up decorations
for the sake of the guest, you should have done what would please me,
at least out of courtesy and respect for me! We shall make progress
towards swaraj only if we do everything thoughtfully and with
understanding. The volunteers whom we see moving about here are
dressed in English- style coat-and-trousers of duck cloth. How absurd
that volunteers for swaraj work should use duck cloth! If you cannot
afford to buy new khadi, I am ready to give you khadi to replace your
duck cloth. If</p>

you feel too embarrassed to accept khadi from me, I would advise you
to do your work as volunteers wearing only a loin-cloth. It is not
that service can be rendered only by dressing oneself up like an
Englishman. It is with your love and good behaviour that you should
impress the people. If you are seeking to do so with your English
trousers, give up the idea altogether. We should discard this apparel
at least to keep up our dignity as Indians out to win swaraj.
Personally, I would advise the volunteers to spin every day for two
hours. You can be true volunteers only when you spin yourselves, get
the yarn woven into cloth and wear that cloth.</p>

In our swaraj army, grown-ups would not work as effectively as little
boys and girls. The former are steeped in fraud, hypocrisy and pride.
If these things disappear, we should get swaraj this very day. Though
advanced in age, we should have innocence, like Maulana Shaukat
Ali’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. This man’s mind is as pure and tender as a child’s.
He wishes ill of none.  He fears only God. Learn innocence from him. 
I have cultivated innocence by constant effort. I have built the
embankment, putting a pebble at a time, have filled the pond drop by
drop; it is still unfilled. Maulana Shaukat Ali has lived in luxury
and yet he has the strength to mount the scaffold this moment. I
revel in khadi and the touch of silk is torture to my body, whereas
Shaukat Ali is in love with muslin and silk. When, nevertheless, he
puts on khadi, the thing must be regarded a miracle. He has embraced
the hardships of a fakir’s life for the sake of Islam.</p>

It is rarely that language succeeds as a vehicle of thought. More
of-ten than not it conceals thought. Always language circumscribes
thought.When, especially, a person translates from another’s
language, what difficulties are experienced and howlers perpetrated
only trans- lators and journa-lists know. We have been in such
difficulties time and again. We publi-shed Shri Vamanrao Joshi’s
statement<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>in
 bold type on the front page. When we read the printed translation,
we our- selves felt ashamed. We felt we had done an injustice to this
brave man, or, rather, to readers. The message seemed to go against
the ideas and methods which we wish to see prevail. The translation
we printed was from English. Shri Vaman-rao’s original message was
of course in Marathi. The objectionable element we find in our
translation is not present in the original at all. “It is not our
business to reveal our own shame in public”—is the view we have
attributed to Shri Vaman- rao.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>Our courage lies in being ever ready to expose our
shame.  Shri Vamanrao wishes to cloak the people’s shame by himself
displaying courage and not by leaving that shame unexposed. By hiding
their shame the people become emasculated, just as a disease grows by
being concealed. If one Indian apprehends another and a third
punishes the latter, there is no shame in this at all. There may be
some-thing to be ashamed of in the occasion itself. When, however,
swaraj is established, an Indian policeman will arrest an Indian who
has committed a crime and the latter will be punished by an Indian
judge. That will not seem shameful; in fact, it will be normal and
accepted as such. Shri Vamanrao has made his remarks with reference
to the present situation. He has pointed to and exposed our shame in
an Indian serving [the Gove-rnment] for the sake of the belly, ever
the cause of so many sins, arresting another innocent Indian, and in
a judge, in the same position as the first Indian, sentencing the
latter. But it pains us that we could not bring out in our
translation all this</p>

call themselves orthodox <i>sanatanis </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
</font></sup>behave like beasts towards the <i>Bhangis </i>and
oppress them. The <i>Bhangis </i>are our kith and kin, our
blood-brothers. We accept their service and do not even pay them
adequate wages, so that they are obliged to live on the remains on
our plates which we offer them and are driven to eat carrion. As for
service, I do not think that a lawyer, a doctor or a collector serves
soceity a whit more than a <i>Bhangi</i>. The <i>Bhangis</i>’
services surely rank much higher than the services of these. If the
former were to stop serving, what would be the plight of society? The
calamity taht has befallen us is the reward of the sin we have
committed against the <i>Antyajas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>.  The  punishment  for  our  sin   has   to   be  
shared   by   the Muslims because they are our neighbours. Many
Hindus cite Shastras for avoiding contact with the <i>Bhangis</i>. I
tell you, however, if there is any Shastra which says that it is sin
to touch a <i>Bhangi</i>, it is no Shastra. A Shastra can never be
beyond the power of reason to under-stand, something which disregards
truth. For the rest, the Shastras may be interpreted in any way one
chooses. What do we not do in the name of the Shastras? In their
name, mendicants consume bhang and smoke <i>ganja</i>; in the name of
the Shastras, some devotees of a goddess consume mutton and wine and
numberless people indulge in immoral practices; in the name of the
Shastras, in the Madras Presidency, girls of tender age are forced to
become prostitutes. What greater travesty of the Shastras can there
be than this? I regard myself an orthodox <i>Vaishnava</i>; I believe
in the <i>Varnashrama</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>5
  </i></font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i> </i></font></sup>way
of life.  But I tell you, the idea that one gets polluted by touching
a <i>Bhangi </i>is an excrescence on Hinduism, a kind of dirt which
has settled on it.</p>

I must say that just as not every man can eat or digest a rich dish,
I wonder whether I can digest the glowing praises showered on me.
Some day, perhaps, I shall deserve them. I am doing my best in that
direction. I have been striving to be able to vanquish untruth with
truth and anger by refusing to oppose it with anger, and I wish that
I should lay down my life in the effort. But, at present, the
epithets you have applied to me are misplaced. If, hearing them, I
become in- different or overbearing or smugly assume that I already
deserve them because people have offered them to me, immediately my
degradation would begin. My effort should be, above everything else,
to maintain humility and see that I do not transgress the limits of
properiety. The country’s good and mine lie in my working with this
vigilance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
Your giving me a welcome address bespeaks the marvellous awa-kening
in the country. It only means that the Municipality has realized its
role. I hope to get much work for the country done through
munici-palities. And that is the reason why, in the resolutions
adopted at the last two sessions of the Congress,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>municipalities have not been asked to join the
non-co-operation movement. Being what they are, the munici-palities
involve some element of co-operation, but then, at present, there is
not a single thing of ours which is free from it. There is
co-operation even in eating one single grain of wheat. The
non-co-operation we are employing at present is so  light  that even
a child can shoulder its burden. If we can carry out intensive
non-co-operation, it has such miraculous power that we can get swaraj
in a day. But I have taken care to put before the country only a
simple form of non-co-operation which the country will have strength
enough to carry out, and every municipality can join it. If the muni-
cipalities in the country understand this and organize whatever work
they can do, swaraj will be easy to win.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
As regards what this Municipality can do, all I have to say is, keep
the promise you have given to make an effort to act upon the advice
of the Congress. Gird up your loins for the removal of
untouchability. I have mentioned this first, leaving aside the
spinning- wheel. The latter represents the supreme task to which we
should bend all our efforts, but there is a still more important task
for the Hindus,</p>

which is to see that not the slightest trace of untouchability
survives. Work has to be done in the spinning-wheel movement, but in
this our very mentality has to be transformed.</p>

Last night I went to the <i>Bhangi </i>quarters in Godhra. I was in
agony at the sight of the conditions there. I wonder why Hindus,
sharp-eyed as they are, cannot see what is visible even to the naked
eye, why they do not know that there is a carbuncle on their back.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
You have been elected to get the city cleaned of its refuse, to look
after the health of the people, to provide education for  the
children and to prevent diseases. You can do this only by raising the
status of <i>Bhangis</i>. There will be no meaning in swaraj if you
think merely of filling your pockets, just as England served its own
interests on the pretence that it was fighting the War for the sake
of small states like Belgium.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Why do I call this Government Satanic? It had drawn the sword not for
defending the weak but for devouring them. In our swaraj, in our
<i>dharmarajya</i>, there will be only one aim, to serve the weak. We
can be called true swarajists only if we do  <i>tapascharya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>to  get  pure swaraj which will provide cool shelter
to all.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus, the uplift of the <i>Bhangis </i>is your first duty. Their
streets must be clean, their houses tidy; they should have a
convenient source of water. I now call myself a <i>Bhangi</i>.
Personally, I delight in spening some time in a <i>Bhangi </i>locality.
That is, indeed, a recreation for me. Fondling their children gives
me joy. The Municipality, therefore, cannot be said to have
discharged its duty so long as the <i>Bhangi </i>quarter is not in
such condition that a man like me can stay there and observe the
rules of hygience.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
By a national school, we should at the present time understand a
school for spinning, for our education should provide us with the
sustaining nourishment, which would make us free and radiant with
vigour. I have been correcting my mistake with regard to education.
If we try to impart no better education than what the Government
provides, we shall go down. If we want to infuse strength into our
people, the spinning-wheel is the only effective remedy. It is the
basis of a goldern plan for education. Introduce it in the schools
and then you will not have to go begging to maintain them.</p>

Though the sum for the whole of India, for the memory which it is
intended to perpetuate and for the purpose which it is to fulfil, is
small enough, it will not be collected without persistent and wide
spread effort. The surest way of not collecting the sum will be for
each province merely to think of its own quota and be satisfied with
it. The surest and the quickest way of collecting the sum is for
everyone and for every province to collect the whole or the most it
can. thus, a few millionaires of Bombay could, if they chose,
subscribe the crore required in a day. It would be ridiculous for
Bombay to fling its quota at India and rest content. Bombay alone can
well shoulder the whole burden. Bombay has allowed India to think

famous shrines to contribute to the Tilak Swaraj Fund. They must have
faith, and courage that faith brings. Similarly Bengal. Bengal has
many rich men but it has not as yet shone for its patriotic finance.

most difficult plight. For the Mussulmans, Ajmer is a name to conjure

handsome con-tribution to the Tilak Swaraj Fund. Every worker must
realize that there is not a moment to lose. I invite the heads of
each province to send weekly notes of sums collected by them for
publication. There must be systematic house-to-house collection.
Gujarat has copied the Punjab. It has receipts on coloured art paper,
containing a fine portrait of the deceased patriot in a corner. The

Committee is an easy programme for business people. It is an

establish swaraj without the swaraj workers developing fine business
habits.</p>

there was no complaint. The result was electrical. The drinking party
was nonplussed. The stone-throwing lost its force for want of
reaction. And I understand that after the incident there has been no
stone- throwing at all the effect on the visitors to the drink shops
has also been equally great. I regard this as one of the best
examples of non- violence and its immediate results. Had Dr. Kanuga
complained to the police, or his companions retaliated, there would
have been a con- fusion of issues. All kinds of side issues would
have been raised and, as usual, feeling would have run high among
parties and, what is worse, the cause of temperance would have
suffered a set-back. Dr. Kanuga’s bravery, sacrifice and

Whenever I find my friends misunderstanding the movement, I mutter to
myself the words of a celebrated hymn: “We shall know each other
better when the mists have rolled away.” A friend has just sent me
the paragraphs on non-co-operation in the <i>Servant of India </i>of
the 14th instant. It is such a fruitless task explaining resolutions
and motives. The year will soon pass away and our actions, more than
words, will demonstrate the meaning of non-co-operation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
For me non-co-operation is not suspended, and never will be, so long
as the Government has not purged itself of the crimes against
India—the Mussulmans and the Punjabis, and so long as the system is
not changed to respond to the will of the nation. Surely it was 
necessary to remove the hallucination about titles, law-courts,
schools and Councils. I venture to think that, on the whole, the
nationalists have responded nobly in regard to these items. There are
no titled men among them, no nationalist lawyer who has  not 
supended practice has any public status among non-co-operators,
schools and colleges have furnished boys and girls who are now giving
a good account of themselves and who, I make bold so say, will
stagger humanity by their sacrifice when the time of their trial has
arrived. Those who have refrained from entering the Councils are
rendering, as all who care may see, a service which they could not
have rendered in the Council halls. The few who have given up their
titles have shown the way to the others. All these are acting as
leaven in the community. Now, there is little need for verbal
propaganda among these special classes. The action and character of
those who have renounced titles, schools, courts or Councils
constitute a propaganda more telling and effective than speeches.
National schools are multi- plying themselves, boys are still leaving
schools and colleges. The Government statistics are hopelessly wrong.
I remember having seen a councillor quoting that less than 3,000
students had left educational institutions. This takes no count of
thousands who are studying in nationalized schools. The number of
suspensions of practice is steadily growing—see the list of
suspensions in Dharwar and Guntur given in another column. Even
titles are still being surrendered. And  as the timid or the cautious

I should not be surprised if the history of the South African

</font></sup>When the first part began, the majority weakened.  Only
150 were found willing to court imprisonment. Then there was a
settlement and a breach and a revival. Nobody even believed, save a
few of us, that the rsponse would come in time. Well, the last stage
commenced with sixteen men and women who sought imprisonment. This
was followed by a perfect storm. The whole community rose like  a
surging wave. Without organization, without propaganda, all—nearly
40,000—courted imprisonment. Nearly ten thousand were actually
imprisoned. The sequel is known. The community gained all it had
fought for  at  the  time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

I refuse to believe that India will do less. To recall Lord Cann-
ing’s words, under the blue and serene Indian sky a cloud no bigger
than a man’s thumb may appear on the horizon, but it may any mo-
ment assume dimensions unexpected by any, and no man can tell when it
may burst. When India as a whole will respond by action, I cannot
say. But this I do say that the educated classes to whom the Congress
has appealed will one day—and probably during this year— respond
in a manner worthy of the nation.</p>

But whether they do or not, the progress of the nation cannot be
arrested by any person or class. The uneducated artisans, the women,
the men in the street, are taking their share in the movement. The
appeal to the educated classes paved the way for them. The goats had
to be sifted from the sheep. The educated classed had to be put upon
their trial. The beginning had to be made by and through them.
Non-co-operation has hitherto, thank God, followed its natural
course.</p>

Swadeshi propaganda in its intensive and exclusive form had  to come
and it has come in its order. It was, and is, part of the non-
co-operation programme. It is, I claim, the biggest, the safest, and
the surest part. It could not be taken up earlier in its present
form. The country had to see its way clear to the spinning-wheel. It
had to be purged of the old superstitions and prejudices. The country

military drain as the loss of this supplementary industry that sapped
India’s vitality and made famines an ever-recurring event in Indian

All these things have now happened. The crore men and women and the
crore rupees are required to resuscitate this national dharma. The
problem is not that of a few charkhas but of putting charkhas in
every one of the six crore homes. The problem is that of manu-
facturing and distributing the whole of the cloth required by India.
It cannot be done by one crore rupees. But if India gives one crore
rupees, one crore men and women, and introduces two million char-
khas in working order in as many homes before the 30th June, she is
nearly ready for swaraj. Because the effort will have created, in the
nation as a whole, all the qualities that make a nation good, great,
self- reliant and self-contained. When the nation has, by a voluntary
effort, completed its boycott of foreign cloth, it will be ready for
swaraj. Then I promise that the various forts in the Indian cities
will, instead of being an insolent menace to the freedom of India,
become playgrounds for her children. Then the relations between
Englishmen and ourselves will have been purified. Then the Lancashire
vote will have been sterilized. And Englishmen will, if they choose,
remain in India as friends and equals, with one sole aim—truly of
benefiting and helping India. Non-co-operation is a movement intended
to invite Englishmen to co-operate with us on honourable terms or
retire from our land. It is a movement to place our relations on a
pure basis, to define them in a manner consistent with our
self-respect and dignity.</p>

But call the movement by any other name. Call it ‘swadeshi and
temperance’. Assume that all these previous months have been a
waste of effort. I invite the Government and the moderate friends to
co- operate with the nation in making hand-spinning universal and in
making drinking a crime. Neither party need speculate as to the
result of these two movements. The tree will be judged by its fruit.</p>

Sir William Vincent’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

He says that the declared object of non-co-operationists is paralysis
of the Government and that “in their effort to achieve the object
there is no source of discontent which they have not used”. Now
both these statements are half-truths. The primary object of non-
co-operation is nowhere stated to be paralysis of the Government. The
primary object is self-purification. Its direct result must be
paralysis of a Government which lives on our vices and weaknesses.
Similarly, it is a dangerous half-truth to say that we have left no
source of discontent unused. We could not help using sources of
legitimate discontent. But non-co-operationists have rigidly
refrained from using any and every discontent, if only because we
would weaken our cause if we did. The illustration of what I mean
will be best seen from the refutation of the very next sentence which
Sir William has spoken in support of his contention: “Wherever they
find discord between employer and employee, there some agent of
emissary of non-co- operation party proceeds at once to foster
discontent and promote ill- feeling.” This is not only untrue, but
it is an incitement to the two to oppose non-co-operation. The avowed
policy of non-co-operation  has been not to make political use of
disputes between labour and capital. They have endeavoured to hold
the balance evenly between the two—we would be fools if we wantonly
set labour against capital.  It would be just the way to play into
the hands of a Government which would greatly strengthen its hold on
the country by setting capitalists against labourers and <i>vice
</i><i>versa</i>. In Jharia, for instance, it was a non- co-operator
who prevented an extending strike. The moderating influence in
Calcutta was that of non-co-operators. The latter will not hesitate
to advance the cause of strikers where they have a just</p>

grievance. They have ever refused to lend their assistance to unjust
strikes. “Where there is a racial ill-feeling”, declares Sir
William Vin- cent, “these emissaries hurry on their evil errand.”
He must know that this is a false statement. There is a racial
feeling between English-men and Indians. There is the memory of
Jallianwala—an evergreen. But “these emissaries” have been
varitable messengers of peace. They have everywhere restrained the
fury of the unthinking. And I make bold to say that but for the
existence of the spirit of non-violence, there would have been more
innocent blood spilt in spite of the threat of Dyerism and
O’Dwyerism. Our fault has lain in refusing to lick the boot that
has kicked, in withdrawing co-operation until there was frank
repentance. Non-co-operators are to be blessed for turning the fury
of an outraged people from Englishmen to the system they are called
upon to administer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But Sir William is nothing if he is not thorough in his attempt to
divide and rule. He declaims: “Where there are quarrels between
land- lord and tenant, have we not seen this in the United
Provinces—there again proceed these emissaries of evil to propagate
unrest, and stir up disorder.” Sir William should know that the
tenant movement is under the control of Pundit Jawaharlal Nehru whose
one purpose regarding the tenants has been to educate them to be
patient and calm. Sir William has simply attempted to set the
landlords against the non-co- operation movement. Fortunately the
landlords know as well as the tenants that, so long as they are just,
they have nothing to fear from non-co-operators.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The movement, says Sir William, “is purely destructive, and so far
as I have been able to ascertain contains no element of constructive
ability”. It is undoubtedly destructive in the sense that a surgeon
who applies the knife to a diseased part may be said to make a
destructive movement. This destructive movement bears in it the
surest seed of construction as the surgeon’s knife contains the
seed of health. Is temperance destructive? Are national schools
springing up everywhere destructive? Are the thousands of
spinning-wheels destructive of a nation’s prosperity? They will
destroy foreign domination whether it hails from Lancashire or is
threatened from Japan.</p>

Having attempted to set classes against masses, Sir William pro-
ceeds to paralyze both with the feeling of helplessness and the fear
of internal strife and aggression from without. Is Hindu-Muslim unity
such flimsy stuff that we shall begin to quarrel as soon as the
British</p>

guns are withdrawn from our shores? Were we sixty years ago less able
to protect ourselves than we are now? Or is it not a fact that,
judged by the Western standard, we were never so helpless as we now
are? Self-government, as I have said before, connotes the power of
sell-protection, and a country which cannot protect itself is not
pre- pared for immediate and complete self-government. In this one
sen- tence Sir William has unwittingly condemned British rule and
proved the necessity of immediate mending or ending of that rule.
Accor- ding to my method—the method of suffering or soul-force,—the
country is today prepared for self-protection. According to Sir
William’s standard, the reforms have nothing in them to enable
India even in a hundred years to arm herself for defence against a
com- bination of world powers. Judged by that standard, the reforms
do forge stronger the chains that bind India and make her feel
helpless. The speaker talks glibly of impending destruction of every
vested interest. He needs to be reminded that the greatest vested
interest of India—her self-sufficiency—was destroyed by this
foreign domi- nation and the speaker’s plan will still further
deepen India’s poverty.</p>

motives, so has he misconstrued their methods. We have not failed in
our effort regarding the educated classes. I admit that the response
in practice might have been greater from them. But I make bold to say
that the vast majority of them are with us in spirit, though the
flesh  being weak, they are not able to make what from their point of
view is a sacrifice. We have been trying to act on the masses from
the commencement. We regard them as our mainstay, for it is they who
have to attain swaraj. It is neither the sole concern of the monied
men nor that of the educated class. Both must subserve their interest
in any scheme of swaraj, and as soon as the masses have attained
sufficient self-control and learnt mass discipline, we shall not
hesitate, if necessary, to advise them to suspend payment of taxes to
a Govern- ment that has never truly looked after their welfare and
that has ex- ploited and terrorized them every time they have shown
the least symptom of rising against their exploitation.</p>

Sir William has been extremely disingenuous in describing the
Government’s methods of dealing with non-co-operation. Defence of

ordinary statutes against them in an extraordinary manner under a
licence given to him by non-co-operators who will not challenge
orders in a court of law. He will not conciliate the malcontents by
granting swaraj, for that would lead to anarchy. He does not bother
his head about the two things which have caused all the unrest and
which have acted like two active and corroding poisons in the Indian
body—the Khilafat<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

He has ornamented his extraordinary speech with an ungen- tlemanly
and insinuating attack upon the Ali Brothers who are putting up a
noble fight for Islam and India, and a still more ungentlemanly
attack on a ‘gentleman of the name of Yakub Hasan’, and an ungra-

painful to have to criticise it. I assure the reader that,
self-restrained as  I am in language, the speech has been a severe
strain upon my capa- city for restraint. I have scored out many an
adjective which I believe would accurately describe Sir William’s
performance. I am sorry.</p>

realize that self-government is our birthright. Even English- men
admit that their Empire in India is based on our weakness. Sir R.

Today you have sanctified yourselves by giving room in your midst to
your own brothers [the <i>Antyajas</i>], but maintain that sanctity
for ever. Do not do this in order that you may have my services or
that you may please me, thinking it imprudent to kick a milch cow; do
it as a matter of duty. Whatever service I render, I do merely as my
dharma. I want no return from you for that service. Dharma has no
concern with reward; it is concerned with God. I do not want a salary
from the people. God will give me my salary and reward. Hinduism  in
fact teaches us that, whatever a man does, he must offer it up to
God, and only then will it bear fruit. If, therefore, you have done

This is not my first visit to Navsari. I came here for a day in the
course of my wanderings in 1915. But times have changed.  There is  a
big difference between then and now. Today, we are in a new era. God
alone knows what this era will bring and how we shall be tested
before the world. We may plan as we choose, but it is in God’s
hands to fulfil our plans. Man proposes and God disposes.</p>

Misled by the apparent enthusiasm of the people and by the vows they
have taken, a man like me may hope that swaraj will be established,
the rule of dharma will prevail within one year; but who knows
whether the thing we may establish will turn out to be God’s rule
or Satan’s rule? Who knows now whether our swaraj will be the rule
of Satan or <i>Ramarajya</i>? My conscience at any rate affirms that
we are moving in the direction of dharma. Judging from the progress
made, we find that, if we maintain the speed with which we have
worked during the last five or six months, we shall certainly succeed
in establishing the rule of dharma within the remaining six months.</p>

My especial object in coming to Navsari was to meet my Parsi sisters
and brothers in this centre of the Parsis and say a few words to
them. Navsari is a big Parsi centre.  Bombay too is such a centre,
but  it cannot be said to be theirs exclusively. Bombay is what in
English is called a “cosmopolitan city”. Bombay is like

association with them has been so close that I feel under a debt to
them. I wrote that letter to repay my debt. I cannot forget the love
which the Parsis have showered on me in India, in England, in South
Africa, in Zanzibar and in Aden. I can certainly say this about
myself, that I am not ungrateful. I can appreciate the value of a
good turn and that is why it will pain me if the Parsis remain aloof

The Parsis have a gift for business. They are second to none in
business competition with anyone in the world. The community has a
very enterprising spirit. Because of it, the fame of your community
of eighty or a hundred thousand has spread all over the world.
Wherever you have gone, you have shown your wonderful intelligence
and ability. No one can equal the Parsis in generosity. No community
has donated as much for philanthropic purposes as the Parsis have
done. Andrew Lang has calculated figures of charities done by all the
communities in the world and shown that, relatively to their popu-
lation, Parsi charities exceed all others. The Hindus have given
much, but the community is like an ocean and, for a community of such
size, its charities are but a drop in it. The Muslims, too, have
given dona- tions and the gifts made by the Christians are also well
known; how- ever, if any comparison is possible, it is with the
charities made by the Jews, and even these the Parsis surpass. The
Parsi charities, besides, are meant for all. If such a community puts
its ability to good use, it is bound to benefit the world.</p>

By accepting them, the Hindus and India as a whole have only gained.
The Parsis, too, have gained. They can take pride in India, in
calling themselves Indians. Coming over here, the Parsis have both
taken and given. I have entertain-ed great hopes of them. I am sure
that, thanks to their generosity, they will make no small
contribution to the tasks of this new era. I do not ask for a
contribution by way of monetary  or intellectual help alone. That
contribution they will certainly make; what I want from them is a
contribution by way of sincere feelings of the heart—in terms of
reli-gious feeling. Call to mind the command- ments of the Prophet in
whom you believe. I have read your scrip- tures in Gujarati and
English, as many as I could get. I felt that I was reading the Vedas
or the <i>Upanishads </i>or <i>Gita</i>. Some Parsis have compared
the sayings of Zarathustra with the <i>Upanishads</i>. There is great
similarity between the injunctions of Zarathustra and those of other
religions. I am sure, therefore, that the Parsis will make their
contribution in terms of religious feeling.</p>

But is is one thing to learn that language and quite another to make

This is my message to my Parsi brethren. If the Parsis present here
are not many, it is my request to those who have come that they
should convey my message tomorrow to each and every home. You need
not feel anxious because you are only a handful. Numbers are of no
consequence. Virtue lies not in numbers but in behaving as men, in
heroism, in courage. If there should be fifty thousand counterfeit
coins, they would be worthless; the value of one genuine coin will be
greater than that of any number of counterfeit ones. If, therefoe,
the Parsis are genuine coins, they can give a good account of
themselves tothe world. I hope they will prove themselves genuine
coins.</p>

I have said more than enough to you. If you are so inclined, you may
not at present join in the whole programme of non-co- operation, but
in regard to one matter, I pray for your help specially. You will
have laid us under a great obligation if you give up all idea of
earning money through liquor-booths. It is not Parsis alone who run
these booths. Hindus also do so, Anavil Brahmins among them, and
Muslims too are engaged in that business. In the Punjab, there are
distilleries in the hands of the Sikhs, followers of the brave Guru
Govind Singh. I have been appealing to all of them. As the Parsis,
however, are a small community, the thing will be easy for them.
There are liquor-shops in the hands of Parsis all over India. The
first task under swaraj will be to see that there are no
liquor-booths and no big distilleries in the country. There may be
small distilleries at wsome places to produce alcohol for medicinal
purposes. But this alcohol will be treated like opium and arsenic.
The latter are difficult to pro- cure, though available at a
chemist’s shop. In the same way, liquor also should be difficult to
procure.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
I ask Parsis’ help in the great movement for swadeshi. You will be
glad to learn that a Parsi sister has placed an order for 40 saris of
pure swadeshi. Superfine saris of hand-spun yarn can be produced in
Madras. If the Parsi sisters would indulge their tastes, saris to
suit their purses can be produced in Bezwada.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
Some sisters have indeed adopted swadeshi but, as you know,  I am a
greedy an, a miser. So I cannot be happy as long as the whole of this
little community does not shine with lustre. You see beauty in silk
clothes, but you will be able truly to adorn yourselves and India
only by wearing khadi. Many Hindus still do not wear khadi, nor do
Muslims. But you should not follow others’ example. If other people
take to wrong ways, we need not do likewise. Your community can set
an example to crores of Hindus and Muslims. When I visited a handloom
factory in Surat, I was glad to find a Parsi brother doing a bit for
swadeshi. But I am not a man who will be satisfied with that little.
Introduce a spinning-wheel in every one of your homes. Your Parsi
sisters can spin very fine yarn. You spin fine woollen yarn for your
sacred thread. Dedicate this gift of yours to the country. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

What shall I say about the Hindus’ contribution to the history of
the wold ? We have had a glorious past; if, however, we fight merely
on the strength of our ancient heritage, we shall lose the battle. We
should show ourselves as great as our forefathers. Our sages let
their bodies be cut into pieces in order to preserve their dharma.

that, whereas in Europe there was but one Thermopylae, in India we
find every street and lane to have been a Thermopylae. I shall not go
into history to tell you what great heroes India has produced. I
shall only say this: Let us place our hands on our hearts and ask
ourselves whether we have that heroism in us today.</p>

Anasuyabehn informs me that you are not well mentally and physically,
and that you think too much about your mother. It is only natural
that you should be worrying about her. But you have regarded India as
your mother. Every elderly woman is a mother. It is unbecoming to
think that no one would care for you as your mother did. If we serve
our mother, would she not serve us? Now you should take more care of
your health and bring about a situation when you do not need any
service at all. In any case when there is need, God sends someone to
care for even the poorest. Would He then not send somebody to care
for you? Be that as it may, I want you to be relaxed. There is a lot
of work to be done. There are few who work with sincerity. You must
fully do your part.</p>

My letter about the Parsis had led of quite a lot of controversy. Mr.
G. K. Nariman has written an open letter which has appeared in other
papers. Those who have been taking interest in the discussion must
have read it and hence I do not publish it in Navajivan. The views
expressed by Mr. Nariman deserve respectful consideration and the
doubts raised in his letter probably occur to other Parsis too.
Hence, I shall try to answer them.</p>

Our degradation consists in this very idea that we cannot do without
Englishmen for some time yet to come, and swaraj lies in getting rid
of it. In what sense were we in a miserable stage before the coming
of the British? To think, besides, that the moment they leave we
shall fight among ourselves is a humiliating idea. Suppose, how-

The statement that I should first induce many more Hindus to join the
movement before expecting the Parsis to do so bespeaks our weakness.
Both Parsis and Hindus are Indians. The thoughtful among both these
communities owe the same duty to India. Moreover, many Hindus have
already joined the movement and efforts to persuade others to join it
are certainly continuing. Parsis should join the movement even if not
a single Hindu were to join it or if they themselves should be
convinced of its need, before others are.  A person who is himself
convinced should not wait for others [to join].</p>

I admit that anyone who thinks that to hope for swaraj through the
spinning-wheel is to run after a mirage can never approve of the
non-co-operation movement. Gradually, India has begun to under- stand
the truth and it is my faith that it will understand it better still.
I certainly do not think that it is running after a mirage to believe
that we shall be prosperous only if we return to the dharma which we
have forsaken and by forsaking which we have been impoverished. It is
being daily confirmed by experience that the spinning-wheel is our
natural dharma. I consider it no sin to go back to the condition
which existed two hundred or even two thousand years ago. It is
evidence of our having exercised our judgment if we adopt again the
wholesome practices which we may have given up either through
ignorance or under compulsion or through sheer passage of time.</p>

It is indeed sad that Panditji and other big leaders have not joined
this movement. When, however, leaders differ among them- selves, the
people must make their choice. If they believe that nothing should be
done until all are of the same view, they can never make progress.
Under swaraj, everyone will have to make a choice.</p>

It is possible that I may not understand  the  Khilafat  issue,

remain enemies for ever. I do not believe that it is right for any

The doctrine of non-violence which I preach may possibly seem
ridiculous. It represents Hinduism. In its practice, in greater or
smaller measure, lies the vitality of all religions. There is
religion only to the extent that there is compassion. There can be no
limit to compassion and it is not for me to lay down any. Everyone
fixes a limit for himself . In <i>Vaishnavism</i>, non-violence
reigns supreme. I concede that the idea is elaborated with special
emphasis in Jain works, but neither the Jain nor any other docrine
has a monopoly of non-violence. It is a universal, immutable law. To
describe the rules about fasting, etc., found in Jain philosophy as
tending to suicide is, to my mind, not to understand that philosophy.
But there is certainly no need to discuss here the extreme
implications of non-violence. Even if non-violence in such form is
not accepted , it cannot be gainsaid that our duty in the present
circumstances is to fight peacefully—through voluntary suffering.</p>

conductive to violence shows that he has not understood the principle
of non-violence. He seems to suggest that the preaching of non-co-

through strikes is a form of violence. The essential point of
non-violence is to bear no hatred towards the man who has perpetrated
violence, though we know what he has done. I cannot purge the people
of the violence in their hearts by hiding from them the Punjab
outrages or the  Khilafat wrong. My duty is, while telling them of
the massacre, to teach them to be peaceful. The suffering which
strikes cause to some is not violence. One is not responsible for the
suffering one may cause to others while doing one's duty. If people
stop going to an opium shop and in consequence the owner thereof
sustains loss, I am not to blame. He, too, benefits through the
suffering caused to him. Non-co- operation means refusal both to help
the sinner in his sin and to accept any help or gift from him till he
has repented.</p>

Mr. Nariman seems to believe that no propaganda is being done against
the use of opium, etc. A movemment is being carried on to make the
people give up all addictions. Since people feel tempted to visit
liquor shops, picketing of these is justified. And as some Parsi
friends are engaged in the liquor trade, I appeal to them to gave it
up.  I have also been appealing to those who seel opium . But I would
argue that, if they can do so, people should give up drinking,
irrespective of whether or not those addicted to opium give up their
addiction.</p>

Mr. Nariman has raised a number of issues. It is my prayer to him
that, although he may oppose me over the Khilafat, the Punjab and
other issues, if he finds, on independent reflection, that the

to help in bringing this about. In this struggle for
self-purification, even if everyone helps in that item of the

ready to sacrifice his life to save the cow is not a Hindu. So long
as the Hindus, the Muslims and the Christians do not work sincerely
together to defend India, the Hindus will remain Hindus only in name.
But the path of non-violence which I follow tells me that I should
not kill Muslims or Christians to save the cow, that on the contrary
I should lay down my life to save her. Only the purest sacrifice is
acceptable to God. I have been striving and requesting other Hindus,
as also all the other children of India, to join me in this
self-purification. Mr.  Nariman is also hurt by cow-slaughter. I
invite him to join in this <i>yagna </i>of self-purification.</p>

even cloth produced in Indian mills is foreign cloth. We shall not

The second defect is that we still cannot overcome our weakness for

countless number of them are used, to no good purpose. At present we

be of yarn only. Yarn can be arranged in many artistic ways and made
into garlands; it can be braided in many ways. It can be made into
chain-like lengths. There is great love and thoughtfulness in
offering a garland of even plain hanks of fine  yarn  spun by

If we wish to win swaraj during this very year, we should busy
ourselves entirely in work. Meetings, processions and things like
that are all right to the extent they arouse the people. But, where
people have already been aroused , we should merely go on working
silently. Every day, one should go round collecting money and
persuading people to spin, should get new spinning-wheels made and
introduce them into homes which are without them, see to the stocking
of khadi, plead with those who may not have started using it to do so
and induce enthusiastic persons to carry on work for stopping the
consumption of liquor. In this way, everyone must engage himself in
some work for swaraj and induce others to do likewise.</p>

A Parsi sister, a Parsi brother and some others have sent me their
criticism of <i>Navajivan’s </i>language. A constant effort is
being made to keep its language simple. I believe that it is not
within the scope of <i>Nivajivan’s </i>effort to improve the
language or  introduce  difficult words into it; its effort is
limited to propagating ideas in simplest language , such language as
the largest number of people can understand. However, all
contributors do not keep this aim in view. Everyone uses certain
words peculiar to him. I also see that, in consequence, the language
used in <i>Navajivan </i>is not always simple. I wish to assure these
critics that there is no deliberate attempt to make the language
difficult. The aim will always be to keep it simple. I thank the
writers for their criticism. I shall certainly take care to see that
fewer Sanskrit words are used. I know that a large number of Muslim

The duty of the satyagrahis is written in letters of gold. There can
be no satyagraha in an unjust cause. Satyagraha in a just cause is
vain, if the men espousing it are not determined and capable of
fighting and suffering to the end ; and the slightest use of violence
often defeats a just cause. Satyagraha excludes the use of violence
in any shape or form, whether in thought, speech, or deed. Given a
just cause, capacity for endless suffering, and avoidance of
violence, victory is a certainty.</p>

Of all the sweet experiences during my Gujarat tour, none was sweeter
than the sympathetic manner in which the ‘suppressed’ were
received by the other Hindus. Everywhere the audience has received my
remarks on the matter without resentment. At Kalol there was to be a
meeting of ‘untouchables’ to be addressed by me. I pleaded with
the Mahajans that they should permit me to address them in  the
<i>pandal </i>erected for the general meeting. After some hesitation
they agreed. I was to have gone to fetch these ‘outcasts’ from
their  quarters. Their abode was too far from the <i>pandal </i>to
enable them to come. I, therefore, addressed them near the hospital.
But I was glad to note that many orthodox Hindus, who accompanied me,
freely mixed with the men and women who had flocked round me from the
pariah quarters. But the height of satisfaction was reached when in
Sisodra, a big village near Navsari, there were knowingly admitted to
the place reserved for the elite of the village all the many <i>Dheds
</i>who were standing at a distance from the great meeting which I
was addressing. As they were admitted, not a man or woman moved or
protested. Almost every one in the village was present at the
meeting. People from surrounding villages, too, had attended. This
deliberated and solemn admission of several hundred men and women of
the untouchable class to the centre of a great gathering like the
above is to me a sure sign of the pure religious character of the
movement . Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Sisodra, which but a year ago had no hand-spinning, showed fifty
maunds of hand-spun yarn beautifully piled up in a house. Hundreds of
spinning-wheels are now working in this and the surroundings

yarn is as usual now in Gujarat as in the Punjab. Indeed, the
students of Gujarat can certainly give points to the Punjab in
spinning. These students have learnt spinning in an incredibly short
time and are now organizing villa-ges for spinning work. Let the
Punjabis beware. I should be sorry to find the Punjab beaten in the
race. It has stubborn rivals in Andhra, Karnatak, and Gujarat. The

start with the handicap of having to think in English and transmit
their thoughts chiefly in English. Their effect on their own people,
marvellous as it was, would have been greater if they had been 
brought up under a less unnatural system. No doubt they both gained
from their knowledge of the rich treasures of English literature. But
these should have been accessible to them through their own
vernaculars. No country can become a nation by producing a race of
translators. Think of what would have happened to the English if they
had not an authorized version of the Bible. I do  believe  that 
Chaitanya, Kabir, Nanak, Guru Govindsingh, Shivaji, and Pratap were
greater men then Ram Mohan Rai and Tilak. I know that comparisons are
odious. All are equally great in their own way. But judged by the
results, the effect of Ram Mohan and Tilak on the masses is not so
permanent or far-reaching as that of the others more fortunately
born. Judged by the obstacles they had to surmount, they were giants,
and both would have been greater in achieving results, if they had no
been handicapped by the system under which they received their
training. I refuse to believe that the Raja and the Lokamanya could
not have thought the thoughts they did without a knowledge of the
English language. Of all the superstitions that affect India, none is
so great as that a knowledge of the English language is necessary for
imbibing ideas of liberty and developing accuracy of thought. It
should be remembered that there has been only one system of education
before the country for the past fifty years, and only one medium of 
expression forced on the country. We have, therefore, no data before
us as to what we would have been but for the education in the
existing schools and colleges. This, however, we do know that India
today is poorer than fifty years ago,less able to defend herself, and
 her children have less stamina. I need not be told that that is due
to the defect in the system of Government . The system of education
is its most defective part. It was conceived and born in error, for 
the English rulers honestly believed the indigenous system to be
worse than useless . It has been nurtured in sin, for the tendency

“Murder will out.” One wonders whether those who negotiated
Secret Treaties during the late unholy war, ever realized that they
would all eventually see the light of day. It is highly probable that
they knew that they would be out, and that they, the authors, would
have to bear the brunt of criticism. It is highly probable that they
derived Jesuistical satisfaction from the fact that, at the time
these treaties were negotiated, they could be kept secret and that
they served the purpose for which they were intended. Such seems to
be the treaty unearthed by <i>The Bombay Chronicle</i>, and said to
have been entered into between the British Government and the Sheriff
of Mecca. If it is true, it shows the depth to which the British
ministers descended for the purpose of gaining their end. And now
that the end is reached, they treat their own written word as so much
waste paper. Is it any wonder that millions of Indians have lost
faith in Great Britain and refuse to co-operate with her so long as
she will not retrace her steps and purify herself of the corruption
that is eating into her moral being?</p>

temperance must get a refund when better times come. The liquor
dealers are obviously not non-co-operators. There is no reason why
they should not apply to the Government for a refund. As for the

yet been brought about on his conditions. His argument means that no
one need be good unless all become good, whereas reformers set the
example by standing alone. My appeal to the Parsis is to join this

several among the non-Paris have given up drink traffic.</p>

I often receive complaints of ill-treatment from Mesopotamia and from

they have read in papers. The writers complain of ill-treatment by

wrath against the Indian soldiers and clerks in the hope,  I suppose,
that they will not dare to offer for service in Mesopotamia. Let me

But I must confess I have not had the courage to write anything
against it. Having seen even an Aga Khan, prelates, viceroys, and
those that are considered the best in the land openly patronizing it

about it. As journalist and reformer, my function is to call public
attention to these vices about which there is likelihood of public
opinion being created. Much as I disapprove of vaccination, I deem it
to be waste of efforts to draw public attention to the evil. I must
own that I had not the courage to bring the drink traffic in the
campaign of purification. It has come unsought. The people have taken
it up of their own accord.</p>

modification. What is required is a total destruction of the  pest.
Betting at races is a part of the gambling mania. If only the people
will non-co-operate, the evil will die a natural death. Thousands who
attend the race course do so merely for fun. They attend either to
see horses run breathlessly, or because it is the fashion, but they,
nevertheless, aid and abet the ruin of many a gambler.</p>

But betting is, I apprehend, more difficult to deal with than
drinking. When vice becomes a fashion and even a virtue, it is a long
process to deal with it. Betting is not only fashionable but is
hardly regarded as a vice. Not so drinking. Fortunately, it is still
the fashion to consider drinking a weakness, if not positively a
vice. Every reli- gion has denounced it with more or less vehemence.
But betting has escaped such special attention. Let us hope, however,
that the vigilant public will find a more innocent recreation than
attending the race course, and thus show its disapproval of gambling
at the race course.</p>

It is early morning and I am sitting, all by myself, under a tree on
the blanks of the mighty Indus. Birds are chirping among the trees.
No one is in sight except who or three volunteers. In the distance,
on one side, is to be seen the Kotri bridge; on the other nothing but
water. On he opposite bank are trees and a few scattered houses, with
two or three tiny boats anchored idly in the water. There is a breeze
and, thanks to it, the water dances in ripples and makes soft music.
Water and sand shine like gold in the sunlight. My Sindhi brethren
have bound me securely on all sides with the silken cord of love.</p>

renunciation is great, I smile. The happiness, tranquillity  and  joy
which are mine, even an emperor is not likely to have. I should think
rather that such peace was impossible for an emperor. The very
responsibilities of government are a crushing burden on him. In my
own experience I have confirmation of the truth that the mind alone
is the cause of freedom or bondage.</p>

When I compare this love with what I recently enjoyed in Gujarat,
they seem to me to be alike. Wherever I go, I feel as if I was
receiving the same love as in Gujarat. The reason is that I can
regard Sind, too, as my land and feel the joys and sorrows of the
Sindhis as much as I do those of Gujaratis. I do not desise even in
my dreams any benefits to Gujarat at the cost of Sind. But my
patriotism and my religion make me vigilant lest Sind should learn
the weakness of Gujarat. Just as I would never have Sind suffer in
order that Gujarat may benefit, about foreign countries, too, I feel
the same. I would not be guilty of seeking any benefit to India at
the cost of a foreign country. I regard only such an attitude as true
patriotism.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
But my patriotism is as narrow as it is broad. I have no interest
whatever in striving for the welfare of the whole world. I am
interested only in the welfare of my own country. I see the good of
the world in the good of my country. My <i>varnashrama </i>dharma
teaches me that there must be some significance in the fact of my
being born in India instead of in Europe. Every man is born a debtor.
If others owe him anything, he never thinks, should not think, of the
fact. The business man who examines his debit account does not have
to worry about his credit account. Everyone who learns to discharge
his duty gets his rights as a matter of course.</p>

My patriotism directs my attention only to the duties which my
country owes. My pride as a Gujarati only tells me what the
Gujarati's duty towards India is. If this line of thinking is
correct, if my Gujarati sisters and brothers accept it, they
certainly know the duty which they owe.</p>

Gujarat should calculate its share according to this method of
reckoning. It is certainly not too much to expect a collection of
Rs.10 lakhs from Gujarat. In fixing the amount at 10 lakhs, I do not
take into account Gujaratis staying outside. Gujaratis residing in
Bengal may, if they choose, send contributions to Gujarat, but they
ought to pay their share to Bengal. Gujaratis living in Madras must
serve Madras. It will speak for their culture, and India's, if the
Gujaratis spend a good part of their wealth at the place where they
earn it. It is with these considerations in mind that I fix
Gujarati's quota at Rs.10 lakhs.</p>

I have excluded even Bombay in fixing this figure. The Guja- ratis

This holds good in regard to [enrolling] Congress members as well. We
should expect a larger number of members where the awakening is
greater. If towns like Surat and Nadiad, in which the awakening has
been great, rest content with enrolling only as many members as it
may fall to their share to enrol, we would simply lose the game which
we are about to win. In places where the awakening has been great, I
certainly expect that every adult above 21 years of age, whether a
man or a woman, a <i>Dhed </i>or a <i>Bhangi</i>, a Hindu or a
Muslim, will be enrolled as a Congress member. If a man is too poor
to spare four annas, his neighbour should give him that amount and</p>

The arguments about membership and funds also applies to the

be carried out if we remain indolent. It can be implemented only if
all workers work honestly and to the best of their ability all the

primary stage in our education for swaraj. It is, however, a stage

There seems to be an epidemic of hartals. Karachi, especially, has
crossed the limit. Five hartals in a month! It is a hartal if someone
is arrested, a hartal if someone is released and a hartal again if
the Governor pays a visit. Resorting to hartals in this manner
deprives them of all value. To me a hartal is a sacred and powerful
weapon. A hartal is in place on an occasion of great religious
significance, or it may be resorted to for giving expression to
people's feelings when they are very strong. If we look upon any and
every occasion as of religious significance or let ourselves be moved
by strong feelings whenever something happens and so call for a
hartal, we shall have made our measure of what constitutes religious 
significance  or strength of feelings cheap indeed. Had I not felt
that we could not do without a hartal during the Satyagraha Week, I
would certainly not have been instrumental in further lowering the
value of hartals in this season of cheap hartals. I hope that
henceforth a hartal will be called for at any place only on rare
occasions. The best course is not to have a hartal unless the
Congress and the Khilafat  Committee  have discussed the matter and
issued a statement calling for one.</p>

It is, moreover, a sign of weakness on our part to declare a hartal
when someone is arrested. Actually, we want to fill the jails. Our
delive-rance will be possible only when people in their thousands go
to jail. Under an oppressive Government, generally the prison is the
only sacred place for a good man. Jail is the dwelling-place of our
freedom. When large numbers of wholly innocent men are in jail, we
may take it that swaraj is at hand. If we wish to make the jail our
natural home under this Government, there is no sense in our 
declaring a hartal when someone goes to jail. When we have really
shed the fear of jail, the Government will not care to imprison us.

a Kshatriya and Hiranyakashipu a demon.  <i>Varnashrama </i>does not
mean that members of the other castes cannot have the Kshatriya
spirit. Members of all the four castes should have the virtues of a
Kshatriya, though in a Kshatriya they should be prominent and it is
his business in life to cultivate them. But anyone who, born as a
Kshatriya, uses his brute strength against the weak is not a

What must we do then? We must ceaselessly preach against vio- lence
alike in public and in private. We must not show any sympathy to the
evil-doers. We must advise the men who have taken part in the murders
to surrender themselves if they are at all repentant. The workers
must be doubly careful in their talks. They must cease to talk of the
evil of the Government and the officials, whether European or Indian.
Bluster must give place to the work of building up put before the
nation by the Congress. We must be patient if there is no response to
the demand for men, money, and munitions. All police orders must be
strictly obeyed. There should be no processions or hartals when known
workers are prosecuted or imprisoned. If we welcome imprisonments of
innocent men, as we must, we ought to cultivate innocence and
congratulate ourselves when we are punished for hold- ing opinions,
or for doing things that we consider it our duty to do, i.e., For
spinning, or collecting funds, or getting names for the Congress

to stand the gravest provocation and remain non-violent. Let us be
careful lest the hour of our triumph be, by our folly, the hour of
our defeat and humiliation. I implicitly subscribe to the test
suggested by<i>The </i><i>Times of </i><i>India</i>. It may be

Karachi is the worst. Sind is divided into district parties without a
central guiding organization. But Karachi has not one party but many
groups. It was of Karachi that I heard complaints regarding
suspicious finance. Its national public schools, I was told, will not
publish accounts. Karachi will not acknowledge one leader. I heard
even charges of misappropriation of funds. I do not know how far the
charges are justified. But they were brought to my notice with such
persistence and by so many persons that I feel I must call public
attention to them. We are bound to render a faithful account to the
people of every pie they give us. I invite the controllers of
national schools not only to render accounts of their dealings but
also to put their schools under public management. In my opinion
there should be but two funds—the Tilak Swaraj Fund and the
Khilafat Fund. All activities should come under one or the other
organization. All schools must be financed by these two bodies. There
should be no separate collections for separate enterprises. We must
collect and organize our energy and resources, not fritter them away
by having many agencies. We must demonstrate our fitness for swaraj
by sinking differences, avoiding jealousies, and submitting to
control from a central organization, by being able to collect and
honestly spend large sums of money, by managing the education of our
children and our own disputes, by being self-contained in every
village as to food and clothing, and by driving away national vices
such as drink and untouchability.</p>

National schools are springing up everywhere in Sind. I must warn the
managers against preparing big budgets. In my opinion, for this year
at any rate, every school and college must  principally become a
carding and spinning institute. It must pay its monthly expenditure
from the labour of the boys and girls who attend them. The capital
expenditure should only consist of a little furniture and
spinning-wheels. We must not waste national time a present  by
devoting any time to English studies. Earnestness demands recogni-
tion of certain fundamental principles, if swaraj is to be attained
within one year, and if we <i>believe </i>in the programme of
non-co-operation and the resolutions of the All-India Congress
Committee.</p>

Enough, however, of criticism. There was so much to make one hopeful.
The bubbling and almost embarrassing enthusiasm of the people was a
soul-stirring sight. The women of Sind gave liberally to the Tilak
Swaraj Fund. Karachi led with a purse of Rs. 25,000. The purse is
meant for me to be used as I choose. I can only make the choice in
favour of the Tilak Swaraj Fund.</p>

Many non-co-operating students are doing most valuable work in Sind.
The most cheering event I can record is the fact that the Shikarpuris
had a violent quarrel among themselves resulting in the imprisonment
of many notable men, but were able, through the effort of  Sadhu  
Vaswani<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1      </font></sup>to

meant to be a demonstration aga-inst him personally, it was bad
taste, for in my opinion, he is among the wisest officials and but
for the vicious system he is called upon to admi-nister, he would
make a popular Governor. Hartals for imprisonments or discharges are
equally bad taste. Imprisonments must not inspire fear in us. Under
an unjust Government, imprisonments of innocent men must be regarded
as their ordinary lot even as disease is the ordinary state of
persons living in insanitary conditions. The Government will cease to
imprison us when we cease to fear imprisonments. The Government will
cease to exist or (which is the same thing) will reform itself, when
its most frightful punishments, even Dyerism, fail to strike us with
fear. Hartals therefore in regard to imprisonments are a symptom of
nervous fear and must therefore be tabooed. I quite agree with the
<i>I.S.R. </i>that local leaders ought not to declare hartals without
reference to headquarters. As a rule I would say, save the 6th and
13th April, every other hartal should be declared by the All-India
Congress Committee and the Central Khilafat Committee in conjunction.
It will be a misfortune to cheapen the hartals.</p>

tainly become a non-co-operator. As to the third question, the
correspondent misapprehends the position. The nation has not embarked
on complete non-co-operation, not for want of faith or will, but for
want of ability. It has, therefore, not called upon Government
servants as yet to give up their posts. But any such servant is free
to throw up his office whenever he likes. But there cannot be such a
call until all reasonable precautions are taken against an outbreak
of violence. Not until the nation is in a position to find
occu-pation for such men can the call, therefore, be made. Thus here,
there is no</p>

As to the fourth question, my meaning of swaraj is that India should
be able to regulate her life without any restraint from outside. She
should be able to regular her military expenditure  and  the  method
of raising her revenue. She should be able to withdraw every one of
her soldiers from wheresoever she chooses. How this will be , or can
be, done depends upon the nation. India's representatives freely
chosen by the people must decide upon the method of execution. If
swaraj is not established during one year, if I can help it certainly
not a single boy who has left his school or a lawyer his practice
will return thereto.</p>

The reader will find elsewhere a string of questions put by a
correspondent. The most important relates to a speech delivered by
Maulana Mahomed Ali on the fear of an Afghan invasion. I have not
read Maulana Mahomed Ali's speech referred to by the corres- pondent.
But whether he does or not, I would, in a sense, certainly assist the
Amir of Afghanistan if he waged war against the British Government.
That is to say, I would openly tell my countrymen that it would be a
crime to help a Government which had lost the confidence of the
nation to remain in power. On the other hand, I would not ask Indians
to raise levies for the Amir. That would be against the creed of
non-violence accepted by both Hindus and Muslims for the purpose of
the Khilafat, the Punjab and swaraj. And I apprehend that Maulana
Mahomed Ali could not mean more in his speech than what I have
suggested. He could not very well do otherwise, so long as the Hindu-
Muslim compact subsists. The Muslims are free to dissolve the 
compact. But it would be found, upon an examination of the case, that
the compact is indissoluble. Dissolution of the compact means
destruction of India's purpose. I cannot conceive the present possi-
bility of Hindus and Muslims entering upon a joint armed revolt. And
Muslims can hardly expect to succeed with any plan of an armed
revolt.</p>

Afghan invasion. Their own military writers have often let us into
the secret that many of the punitive expeditions were manufactured
for giving the soldiers a training or keeping idle armed men
occupied. A weak, disarmed, helpless, credulous India does not know
how this Gov-ernment has kept her under its hypnotic spell. Even some
of the best of us today really believe that the military budget is
being piled up for pro-tecting India against foreign aggression. I
suggest that it is being piled up for want of faith in the Sikhs, the
Gurkhas, the Pathans, and the Rajputs, i.e., for want of faith in us
and for the purpose of keeping us under forced subjection. My belief
(I write under correction) is that the anxiety of the Government
always to have a treaty with the Amir was based, not so much upon the
fear of a Russian invasion as upon the fear of losing the confidence
of the Indian soldiery. Today there is certainly no fear of a Russian
invasion.  I have never believed in the Bolshevik menace. And why
should any Indian Government, to use the favourite phrase of the
erstwhile idol of Bengal, 'broad-based upon a people's affection',
fear Russian, Bols- hevik or any menace? Surely a contented and a
powerful India (all the more), in alliance with Great Britain, can
any day meet any invasion upon her. But this Government has
deliberately emasculated us, kept us under the perpetual fear of our
neighbours and the whole world, and drained India of her splendid
resources so that she has lost faith in herself either for defence or
for dealing with the simple problem of the growing poverty. I,
therefore, do certainly hope that the Amir will not enter into any
treaty with this Government. Any such treaty can only mean unholy
bargain against Islam and India. This Government , being unwilling to
part with O'Dwyerism as an 'emergency measure, being unwilling to
keep its faith with the Muslims, (I must decline to treat the
Government of India separately from the Imperial Govern- ment) and
being unwilling to let India rise to her full height, wants
Afghanistan to enter into a treaty of offence against India. I hope
that there is but one opinion so far as non-co-operators are
concerned. Whilst unwilling ourselves, we cannot wish others to
co-operate with the Government.</p>

<i>The </i><i>Times </i><i>of </i><i>India </i>has returned to the
charge of insincerity which was to be inferred from its previous
article which I dealt with recently in these columns. It is a sober
article to which no exception could be taken. I am certainly anxious
to retain the reputation for sincerity which has been credited to me
and which I certainly claim. My article, “The Mists”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>should
generally be regarded as  my  last word to my critics. I must rely
upon my actions for final explanation. No man can be called just,
sincere, or good before his death. But I would like to correct some
of the misstatements of <i>The Times </i><i>of </i><i>India </i>writer.
Even when I declared satyagraha, I was charged with having fallen
from my original non-political state and the state of isolation. Even
in South Africa, I was referred by my critics to my past. Every
campaign that I have been connected with had its critics who praised
my past at the expense of the then present. I state this fact not to
disprove the present charge, but to steel my heart against believing
in the charge of unconscious insincerity and self-deception. I never
suspended satyagraha, I certainly never retired into private life. I
suspended civil disobedience, and it remains still suspended, because
I believed, as I still believe, the country not to be ripe for it. My
Himalayan mistake was my miscalculation of the preparedness of the
country. Non-co-operation of the type undertaken is not attended with
any danger such as is attendant on civil disobedience. The latter is
not <i>always </i>a duty as non-co-operation is. Hence it is that I
have said that I must continue to advise non-co-operation even though
it may result in anarchy. Am I to recall my medals, or advise friends
to recall theirs, or advise lawyers to resume practice because,
supposing, anarchists have gained the upper hand? Am I to associate
myself for fear of anarchy with a dishonest Government which believes
in Dyerism as a faith? I know that anarchy as a creed is devilish,
but Dyerism is still more so for it is anarchy wearing the mask of
constituted authority. Ordered anarchy is infinitely worse than
avowed anarchy. Only, in the latter event, I should dissociate myself
from the anarchy of the mob as I have dissociated myself from the
anarchy of the Government. For me both are evils to be shunned. I
have not asked for reprisals against the author of the Jallianwala
Massacre. I have asked for nothing more than the stopping of the
pensions to the culprits and the dismissal of those who are yet
holding office. I have</p>

keep him in office. I have ventured to advise the Sikhs to waive the
prosecution of the murderers as I have advised the nation to waive
the prosecution of the official murderers in the Punjab. I  claim
consistency of conduct about Amritsar and Nankana. I have said
repeatedly that I am acting towards the Government as I have acted
towards my own dearest relatives. Non-co-operation on the political
field is an extension of the doctrine as it is practised on the
domestic field. The reference to my association with lawyers, etc.,
is hardly becoming. As a matter of fact, there are very few
practising lawyers now holding office in Congress organizations.</p>

I adhere to my opinion that where non-co-operators are in a majority,
none who has not fully non-co-operated should hold office. The
Congress Committee has not rejected the proposal. I do not know that
practising lawyers presented me with any address in Surat. But I
would no hesitate to receive one even from them so long as I was free
to wean them from the error of their ways. So far as my association
with the Ali Brothers is concerned, I consider it a proud privilege.
But in South Africa, I had as my associates murderers and thieves,
men who had certainly suffered imprisonment for attempts to murder or
steal. Only they carried out their compact as to non-violence as
honourably as any other satyagrahi. I see no difference between the
old Gandhi and the new, except that the new has a clearer conception
of satyagraha and prizes the doctrine of ahimsa more than ever. Nor,
I promise <i>The Times </i><i>of </i><i>India </i>writer, is there
any self-deception in this belief. But time must show who is right.
Precedent is on my side.</p>

Just as our people fear white men, so do the <i>Bhangis </i>fear us.
As long as we remain white men to them, we must not hope for swaraj.
If we call them <i>Bhangis </i>and keep them at a distance, the whole
world looks upon us as <i>Bhangis </i>and avoids contact with us. Ask
anyone who has been to Africa if it is not true that any white man, a
drunkard or a prostitute-monger or a gambler, feels polluted by 
contact  with Indians. We cannot travel in trains in the same
compartment as the whites, ride in the same trams or walk on the same
footpaths; we cannot carry on trade in the same locality in which the
whites do so. We cannot buy bread where they buy their bread. I grant
that this does not happen everywhere. I will not do injustice to
Englishmen. I am not their enemy. But I have seen in many places that
we are denied admission to places in which the whites lodge and to
rooms which they use for retiring or having refreshments. However,
the whites keep us at a distance for reasons of hygiene, fearing that
their bodies will be polluted. They do not believe that their souls
will be polluted. But we have go into the belief that, if we touch an
<i>Antyaj</i>, our soul will be polluted and God will punish us!
Indeed God is punishing us right now. What greater misfortunes can
there be than famines, natural calamities, cholera, the plague and
the wickedness of the Government? I, therefore, humbly submit to
Hindu society that Hinduism does not consist in clinging to
untouchability but in getting rid of that evil.</p>

Ever since the Parsis settled in India, they have kept their word to
the Hindus, honourably and faithfully. When all others in Bombay were
struck dumb, it was the Parsis whose courage made the others also
vocal. The Parsis’ services to Gujarat will ever be remembered.

matters of religion but have been wholly content that they are able
to follow their own religion. There is no community in the world

A Parsi gentleman used to visit my father. The two were on intimate
terms. I was then a child. How can I forget Edulji Sheth? Every time
he came to see my father, his favourite subject of conver- sation was
simplicity. His own way of living was extraordinarily simple. He was
related to the late Thakore Saheb of Rajkot too. Edulji Sheth did not
hesi-tate to express even before him his views on wasteful
expenditure or oste-ntation. His courage was as great as his
simplicity and both were as great as his noble bearing. Ever since
then I have felt that the Parsi community can do much, give much, if
it wills. I am sure it will save itself from this poisonous wind
[from he West] and that its enterprising nature and its regard or
dharma will save it. It is my faith that the Parsis will continue to
serve India as citizens of the country in the same way as they have
done in the past. May God endow them with discrimination, right
thinking and courage! Whatever the contribution of the Parsis in this
holy fight, India can never forget their nobility and culture.</p>

A Sister named Meherbai Bhesania has written a very loving letter
from Yokohama, the capital of Japan, It has lain with me unanswered
for some time, and I apologize to her for this. I read it again after
a lapse of some days. I kept wondering whether or not I should
publish it and I was also busy with other things and so could not
decide what to do.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
It seemed to me doubtful whether, by offering a prize, we could have
good national songs. Finally, however, I came to the conclusion that
it would not be proper for me not to publish a sister's letter
written with the utmost sincerity or not to announce the prize
offered by her. I therefore give the letter below. I have omitted a
part of it which concerned me alone. Just a few words here and there
have been corrected and paragraphs in English have been translated
[into Gujarati]. The rest of the letter I give as it is. It is a
matter of joy that a sister living so far away takes such interest in
this holy fight.</p>

If Goddess Saraswati inspires any poets of Gujarat and they try their
hand, not tempted by the prize but to respect a sister's wish
conveyed from so far away, I shall be obliged. All entries should be
received by June 30 at the latest. If there is an extraordinarily
good poem on only one of the subjects, the whole amount of the prize
will go to its author. If none of the poems comes up to a certain

It is about Mulshi Peta that I must speak first. It grieves me that I
have not been able to go there myself and acquaint myself a first
hand with the grievances of our brethren there. My knowledge of the
details of the struggle is scanty. I rarely get a chance to read a
newspaper. I naturally hesitate to speak or write on any matter about
which I do not know much. All the same, I have given my views<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>on
it in <i>Youn</i><i>g</i><i> </i><i>India </i>without going into
details. I convey my sympathy to those who are attending this meeting
as representatives of the satyagrahis of Mulshi Peta. People fighting
for their rights always have my sympathy. I understand that the
people of Mulshi Peta are fighting to defend the ownership of their
farms. I stand by them in their claim. I always support people who
are ready to defend their possessions at the sacrifice of their
lives, but I can never join hands with those who are ready to kill
others, be it even for the cause of truth. These people can get my
help only for deciding whether they are fighting for truth or
untruth. When I was asked about the people of Mulshi Peta starting a
satyagraha, I had replied that, if the people had the necessary
strength, the experiment was certainly worth trying. They have proved
that they possess that strength. Whatever they have been able to
achieve is good, so far as it goes. But they can have complete peace
only when they are permanently assured of their rights. If a man does
not want to relinquish his rights over a plot of land, it is not in
keeping with the traditions of our country to obtain possession of it
by recourse to law. I was once engaged in a small case; the man owned
an ordinary piece of land but he was after me like a mad man to save
it for him. As a father does not wish to sell his child, so also a
man is naturally unwilling to part with his land. This has been our
nature from ancient times. I hope that our Tata Company will take no
steps against the satyagrahis of Mulshi Peta. It is welcome to
acquire the land even without payment with people’s goodwill, but I
hope it will make no move to obtain it so long as even one owner is
unwilling [to part with his piece]. It may be European civilization
to acquire land by recourse to a Land Acquisition Act, but I should
have nothing to do with a civilization which I believe to be Satanic.
So long, therefore, as the people of Mulshi Peta carry on their fight
on peaceful lines, the whole of India should back them.</p>

Mulshi Peta. Without raising a little finger, these two warriors
stood undaunted against the attack of Mahant Naraindas of Nankana
Saheb, and let themselves be killed. Their friends had advised them
not to go to the <i>gurudwara</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>on that day. Mahant Naraindas [it was known] had made
preparations for killing them. But they had replied that they would
bow their heads before the Guru Granth Saheb<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>and that they could not be more fortunate than if they
died with their heads thus bowed. Their words came literally true.
Lachhman Singh went right into the <i>gurudwara </i>and was killed as
he stood with his head bowed before the Granth Saheb. Dulip Singh was
left outside. Naraindas came out to kill him. Dulip Singh told him,
“You have gone mad.” He had his dagger with him, but he kept it
sheathed. He was well-built, as the Sikhs generally are. Had he so
chosen, he could have finished off two or three of his assailants
then and there, but that was against his principle. He was bound by
the Congress pledge of non-violence. He was killed by Naraindas even
as he was pleading with him. Only two such men in 33 crores are not
enough. We need such heroes not only among Sikhs, but among Hindus
and Muslims as well. Lachh- man Singh and Dulip Singh were not
lacking in physical strength. But they had resolved not to draw their
sword against anyone. I shall not say anything further about Mulshi
Peta.</p>

If these two brothers acted with great nobility at Nankana Saheb, the
residents of Malegaon have displayed an equal degree of heinousness.
No matter how foul the language the sub-inspector used or how grave
the provocation offered by him, no one who respected the Congress
could commit the dastardly act of killing him. It is the solemn
pledge of the followers of the Congress that, for winning the
country's freedom, they would not kill anyone but would lay down
their own lives instead. Was Naraindas in the Punjab more sparing in
his abuses? In Malegaon, our brethren abandoned their humanity. That
was swaraj can certainly not be won. I am speaking not as a lawyer
but as an Indian. It is only when, by desisting from such deeds
altogether, we prove our claim to be peaceful that we shall win
swaraj, secure justice for the Punjab, succeed on the Khilafat issue
and in stopping the crimes being committed at present in the name of
justice. The world will then see that, compelled by the strength of
our peacefulness, powerful ministers have had to eat their words and

cunning and denunciation but on truth. Why do we not stop payment of

This is a conference held in Maharashtra. I have already stated in
public what I expect from Maharashtra. My faith in it remains. I know
that my work will be done when Maharashtra comes to have complete
faith in this movement. Nowhere else have I seen the like of
Mahara-shtra's capacity for self-sacrifice and its knowledge. Where
knowledge is combined with the spirit of self-sacrifice, the <i>yagna
</i>is perfect. When Maharashtra starts this perfect type of
sacrifice with real enthusiasm, the country or this movement will
have no need left for an ordinary man like myself. It is only as long
as Maharashtra is not awake that there is need for me to work. Many
tell me that Maha- rashtra is behind others. This is true at present.
When Maharashtra comes to have a little more faith, its strength will
reveal itself. Just as the sunrise needs no anno-uncement by beat of
drum, so Maha- rashtra's awakening will be evident to all. I pray to
God that He may grant strength to Maharashtra, so that it can
contribute its full share in this <i>yagna</i>. Nobody adores the
Lokamanya as much as you do. He lived only for swaraj, he went to
jail for it and died working for it. If you prove that you are his
worthy heirs, we shall either win swaraj this year or die in the
attempt. If you can do this. I shall say that you deserved to have
Tilak Maharaj born amongst you. If you do not, give me leave to say
that you will prove unworthy of him.</p>

If you are convinced at heart that India has progressed more during
these five or six months than at any time in the past, you will
secure swaraj during this very year. Only then will you bring peace

distressed with the thought why Maharashtra still lacks the faith
that it can save India by its <i>tapascharya</i>.</p>

by your raising hands [in support of the resolution]. I am an
idolater. What I want is the idol of solid work by you, not the idol
of the late Tilak Maharaj. We are out to win swaraj. When some Sindhi
brethren asked me what we would do if we failed in our efforts to
collect one crore rupees. I told them that they and I would drown
ourselves together in the Indus. I know that Maharashtra does not
have much money, but it has plenty of strength. With that strength
you can have showers of money, if you but choose. How much can you
not do in this <i>pandal</i>, at this very moment? If you have no
faith in anything of this, please tell the world that you, the
educated people of  Maharashtra, having drunk deep of the philosophy
of Bentham and Mill, declare that what Gandhi says is all madness. My
only grief will be to think that non-co-operation is beyond the power
of reason to understand, though it is not beyond the sphere of faith.
However, it is for you to decide what you should do. All that I shall
say is , whatever you accept, accept sincerely.</p>

Every non-co-operator has reason to feel ashamed at the wickedness

their duty and have done great harm to the country and the national

cultured and commit crimes, but it is a different matter to claim
that we are cultured and then commit crimes. A dark spot on a black

catch the eye. In the same way if, claiming to be pure and white, we
get dirty, the world will spit upon us. “Ours is a holy fight”,
“We insist on peaceful methods”, “We will lay down our lives

The most important aspect of non-co-operation is peace, non-
violence. It is those who violate peace that are in reality the
people who co-operate, Peace-breakers help the Government much more
than the Moderates. The Government can very well afford to lose two
or three of its officers if thereby it can suppress the
non-co-operaion movement.</p>

I have often stated in my articles before that the Khilafat issue
cannot be solved and swaraj cannot be won unless peace is preserved.
Things will not be held up if lawyers do not give up practice,
students do not leave schools and colleges and others do not
non-co-operate in their respective spheres, but no one can violate
peace without harming the cause. Hindu-Muslim unity, preservation of
peace and swadeshi, that is, the spinning-wheel, these three are
indispensable conditions, and among them preservation of peace is the
most important. If most people start wearing khadi, a few individuals
here and there not using it will not matter, and a few Hindus and
Muslims fighting among themselves may also be tolerated. But even one
person violating peace and indulging in killing cannot be tolerated,
for it is bound to harm the country greatly. Such is the imperative
requirement of peace.</p>

But who can make himself responsible for peace in the whole country?
This question betrays our weakness. The Government has the strength
to suppress the people if they start looting anywhere; it is only

sufficiently to persuade them to remain peaceful. The whole edifice
of our fight is based on the faith that we have this influence over

What should we do, then? What atonement shall we make for the
Malegaon incident? First of all, we should find out the culprits and
persuade them to confess their crimes and willingly mount the 
scaffold. Everyone of us must learn to control his own tongue and see
that others do likewise. We must stop making inflammatory speeches
and must get over the habit of holding meetings and observing hartals
on every occasion, and, instead of constantly pointing to the Govern-
ment’s lapses, we must learn to think of our own lapses, to examine
our own weaknesses, and must take steps to remove them.  When  Pandit
Arjunlal Sethi was arrested, crowds collected and indulged in
rowdyism. I consider this a sign of cowardice. The people do not wish
to go to jail and do not let Sethiji do so either. This is the reason
why, whenever anyone is arrested, such people seem to be concerned
only with creating excitement. If the people were roused to real
heroism by Sethiji’s imprisonment, they would understand their duty
better and would fully carry out those items of non-co-operation
which pertain to them and thus ensure swaraj. They would give us
harmful addictions, discard any foreign cloth they may have and
forthwith start working on the spinning-wheel, if they have no done
so. It would be interesting to know how many of those who indulged in
rowdyism on the arrest of Sethiji were drink-addicts, how many used
foreign cloth and how many had taken up spinning. He is the worthy
son of his father who, though he might have been careless about
adopting his father’s virtues while the latter lived, adopts them
in every particular after the latter’s death at any rate, and not
the one who gives himself over to lamentatons or revels in giving
caste-dinners in the father’s honour. Rioting and getting Sethiji
released will not help us to win swaraj. That will only delay the
event. If, however, we are spurred to exert ourselves more
strenuously to do our duty, we shall certainly win swaraj much sooner

atonement for he Malegaon incident is for us to acquire greater
control over our minds and our anger, to give up addictions and start
plying the spinning-wheel and wearing khadi exclusively.</p>

What kind of freedom can this “freedom of drink” be? There is no
doubt that the thief has a right to steal. But has not the honest man
also are right to prevent theft? The law goes so are as to give the
people the right to use force against a thief and drive him out. How
is the freedom to commit a theft protected then? prohibitionists, on
the other hand, seek to stop a man from drinking by pleading with
him. How does that violate anyone’s freedom? The Bardoa
Government’s notice seems to imply, in plain words, that the drink
habit is a virtue and the existence of liquor shops a benefit
conferred on the people. If a drunkard or the owner of a liquor shop
is abused or beaten up or otherwise subjected to force and the Baroda
Government punishes the culprit and issues a prohibitory order
against him, its action would be justified. But it is nothing short
of encouragement to drink if a man is considered guilty because he
stands near a liquor shop, advises an intending visitor not to plunge
into the fire of drink and appeals to his better nature. I never
thought that the policy of the Baroda  Government could be so
disgraceful as this. I still hope that this notice is not the result
of deliberation but has been issued by some autocratic officer on his
own responsibility. If this inference is correct, I hope that the
Baroda Government will issue an order withdrawing it.</p>

Shri Phirozeshah Tehmulji Mistri writes from Jalgaon, saying that he

childhood; that he has a large family to support and is fifty-one

eagerly waiting to take over the booth. 'What is the sense, in the

depriving myself of the means of supporting my family?' he asks. 
Will  the liquor trade stop as a result of his action? This is the

commit them. And if we are maintaining our family through sin, it

speak to him. He says, moreover, that volunteers do not confine
themselves to persuasion . They besiege liquor-booths, abuse people ,
try to intimidate old employees of the booth and, if intimidation
fails  to serve their purpose, even beat them up. They also snatch
away bottles of liquor from the hands of the owner of the booth. If
they suspect a person of keeping liquor bottles in his house, they
actually search his house. People refuse to sell him things. If a man

It seems from the letter that all these complaints are  well-
founded. If so, the facts stated in it are truly a shame to the
volunteers. It is as much our duty to respect the person of the
drink-addict as it is to persuade him to give up drink. If we use
physical force to make drunkards give up drink, not only shall we
fail in our aim. but our movement will come to harm. Volunteers all

to  use  force  on anybody. They must confine themselves to
legitimate, courteous means; that is, they may stand near the
liquor-booths, politely request the intending visitor to desist,
approach the members of his family and speak to other members of his
community. Any pressure, beyond this, we have no right to exert. You
cannot make a nation ever virtuous by using force. Those who want to
be sinners have certainly a right to it. That man alone can be called
virtuous who commits no sin though he has the freedom to do so, and
such men alone can benefit the country. If we introduce the element

If we believe that hand-spun yarn alone can win us swaraj, if we have
full faith in the power of the spinning-wheel, if we are certain that
the economic uplift of India is impossible by any other means, if we
agree with the view that millions of people remain perpetually in
debt because their incomes are low for want of a  subsidiary
occupation, we would immediately see that the first lesson we should
give our children is in spinning. This will have two results. In the
first place, the children will learn to be self-reliant and, in the 
second,  when in schools, too, children are taught spinning, it will
soon spread all over the country. It is a somewhat difficult task to
induce people who are utterly broken in spirit or who have got into
the habit of begging or keeping themselves alive, to take up
spinning.  If  we reserve spinning for such people along and thus
make it a profession of the destitute, it will never spread. When,
however, the <i>elite </i>take to spinning as part of their dharma,
the common man will readily do likewise. It is thus easy to see that
the only education, at present or both children and adults can be
spinning.</p>

activity of this sort is spinning. Through it we can achieve boycott
of foreign cloth in the course of this very year, and boycott of
foreign cloth means swaraj. We cannot win swaraj in one year by
improving our knowledge of English and, therefore, our work to that
end should be, at any rate temporarily, suspended. Similarly, as we
cannot win swaraj in one year by becoming great mathematicians or
making big scientific discoveries, we must suspend that effort too.
Nor, again, can we have swaraj in one year by starting factories to
make paper, pins, etc., and so efforts to that end should also be
postponed. In like manner, we may put ourselves questions about any
other pursuit and we shall get the same reply. We can see from this
that only one activity should find a place in all our educational
institutions, colleges, high schools, primary schools and teachers'
training colleges.  Any education in letters that is considered
necessary may be given during the period of relaxation, when the hand
requires rest. An educated Englishman used to have his recreation
through mere changes of work. If he came out of the House of Commons
quite exhausted, he would set himself to observing the movements of
ants and flies. When tired of this, he would take to reading books.
In this way, he found recreation and rest in his varied pursuits. Why
cannot we form this habits in our students? When tired of spinning,
they may take up study of Hindi. When tired of that, they may revert
to spinning. If they do not have courage or that, they may engage
themselves in learning music. When that, too, ceases to be
interesting, they may think of taking up the spinning-wheel again. If
even after this lapse of time they do not feel inclined to spin, they
may learn physical drill and exercise. After that, they may once
again think of spinning. In his way they will become spinning-addicts
by and by. I there is any addiction which the nation requires at
present, it is the addiction to spinning. I suggest this work to the
habitual drunkards as the most effective remedy [for their
addiction]. The intoxication of the spinning-wheel is by no means
less potent than that of liquor. He alone who has experienced it
knows its effect. The difference is that while the one kills, the
other gives life.</p>

anyhow from cotton. It means being conversant with all  the
preliminary processes. Every one who has read the article by
"Ramanuja" will understand the point. The women in Andhra
who spin yarn of 120 counts know the tests for the quality of cotton,
pick out cottonwool from the pods with their own hands, gin it and
card it themselves and then prepare their own slivers as white, as
soft and as polished as sea-foam. Their skill is employed chiefly in
these processes only. After this, producing yarn of 120 counts
appears to them child’s play. Spinning requires time. The
preliminary processes are easy to learn and take less time. It is not
necessary that everyone of us must attain to the level of these model
women-workers, but it is certainly necessary for everyone to pick up
the arts of carding and making slivers. It requires one day only to
learn to make slivers. Let us suppose it takes a week to learn
carding. Even then every spinner must spare that time and learn
carding. Our object will not be served if we use mill-made slivers;
it is impossible, besides, to supply such slivers to all places.</p>

The reader should also know that, formerly, carding was actually a
profession and not a social duty, and so the carder used to earn his
daily wages just as other artisans did. Carders easily earn as much
as Rs. 45 a month, at any rate, not less than Rs. 30. Some carders in
Bombay earn two and a half rupees a day. A spinner would require so
little time to attend to the carding himself that, if his object is
to earn, he can have two annas more for every pound of yarn. One can
card within a short time all the cotton that one uses up for spinning
during  a whole day.</p>

Experience has shown me that I had erred in putting down a
schoolboy’s earning for spinning at one anna for four hours.
Fortunately, I had erred on the side of caution. Being conscious of
my ignorance, I had been over-cautious. I had put down the wages for
eight hours, spin-ning at no more than two annas. I now see that a
spinner can easily turn out in eight hours not 20 <i>tolas </i>but 40
<i>tolas </i>of yarn. If we put the average wage for spinning 40
<i>tolas </i>at four annas, eight hours of spinning brings four annas
to the worker. During the Satyagraha Week, the children in the
Satyagraha Ashram devoted themselves entirely to spinning. Some of
them spun or as many as 10 hours and some started spinning at 4.30
a.m. In the result, one student spun in 10 hours as much as 70 <i>tolas
</i>of yarn. That comes to seven <i>tolas </i>an hour. A good many
more spun at the rate of five <i>tolas </i>an</p>

hour. None of these had a previous training of more than five months
and that, too, not always for even four hours a day. The capacity of
these children has opened my eyes and I realize that a careful child
can give definitely five <i>tolas </i>as hour. At that rate, a child
working for four hours for his school can earn for it two pice an
hour, i.e., Rs. 320  a month at the rate of four hours daily for 25
days. I take this to be the maximum rate of income. Even supposing,
however, that  the school gets on an average only two rupees a month,
it comes to 40 rupees for every class of 20 pupils. Enthusiastic
children can give easily 60 rupees a month to an efficient teacher.
This was one mistake.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Further experience suggests that the children themselves should card
cotton and make slivers. That would bring an additional income of one
anna for every half-pound of cotton. I count the carding and
sliver-making charges at two annas a pound. As the work will take up
some time, we may put down the additional income for four hours at
two pice instead of at four. It would then come to an addition of 50
pice for 25 days. That means that a good child will give Rs. 3-2-0
plus Re. 0-12-6, i.e., Rs. 3-14-6. My earlier estimate was only Rs.
1-9-0. This second mistake of mine lay in my assuming that carding
would be a separate work and would have to be entrusted to
professional carders.</p>

market-price of yarn<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>as
well, something more must be added. I do not consider it an excessive
estimate at all if we add two pice per pound of yarn. We shall see,
when we have worked out all the figures correctly, that this means an
immense gain of the nation from every point to view, how immense we
shall know if we ask people who manage factories. When I think of the
great gain it would mean for the country if, teaching this craft to
the hundreds of thousands of children attending schools, we estimate
the value of their labour and also take into account the fact that
the people will acquire control over the yarnmarket in this way, I

One thing still remains . When we have introduced weaving, too, in
schools, their earning capacity would increase still further. If we

of our calculation, it is certain that a school in which every pupil
earns for it four rupees a month, that is, pays a fee of four rupees
a month, will require no grant and no donation. It will become
self-sufficient and the pupils will have to pay no fee in cash.</p>

I have advised the Surat Municipality to impart education of this
type. It intends to forgo a grant of one hundred and ten thou-sand
rupees. If it might be possible to do this, no additional taxation
would be necessary, the children could be given free education and
the swaraj movement would be greatly helped—such is the sovereign
remedy I have suggested.</p>

I have not lost sight of the difficulties. The biggest is about
accommodation. But where the citizens are helpful, it should be an
easy thing to overcome such difficulties. Buildings owned by caste-
bodies and other associations, as also temples and mosques, could be
used for storing spinning-wheels. Training in spinning  cannot  be
given to all the children who are generally penned up in the present
school buildings. Fortunately, the spinning- wheel does need some
space but does no breathe, so that, though occupying space, it will
purify the air and not foul it and, because of the relatively low
impurity in the air, the children's physical condition will  improve
along with their minds.</p>

With the utmost courtesy and giving his reasons, a gentle man raises
doubts about the power of the spinning-wheel to bring  us  swaraj.
Though the whole letter is worth reproducing, for want of space I
give here only the gist of his argument. He says: “The
spinning-wheel can perhaps make up self reliant, can even help us to
earn a living comfortably , but it passes my understanding how it can
help us to win political power. The spinning-wheel was there in
Clive’s time and still we lost our freedom. That is to say, an end
to Lancashire’s interests does not mean the end of all the
interests of England . Hence, even if foreign cloth ceases to be
imported, England will still posses substantial vested interests in
India.” These doubts are not pointless, but it ought to be easy for
the reader of <i>Navajivan, </i>to answer them; in view of the fact
that they are nevertheless entertained by this friend, who seems to
be a careful and regular reader of <i>Navajivan</i>, I see the
inadequacy of my own powers of explanation. If  I persevere in
patiently explaining the matter in different ways, I hope</p>

that readers will be gradually convinced. I am quite sure that there
is no flaw in my reasoning. It is my power explaining which must be
at fault. The correspondent seems to agree , at any rate, that with
the help of the spinning-wheel we can bring about boycott of foreign
cloth. If so, I submit that this same power, the power by which, in
the face of numerous obstacles and despite harassment by the
Government, we can bring about boycott of foreign cloth, ought to
serve our purpose for winning political freedom.</p>

Let us now examine the figures. We spend Rs.60 crores on foreign
cloth. Next comes sugar, which carries away 23 crores. Then comes
steel, with 16 crores. The next noteworthy item, machinery, consumes
about nine crores and a half. Of nearly the same order is mineral
oil. The remaining items are relatively of minor importance. If we
can succeed in the great task which we have undertaken of saving
Rs.60 crores, similar ventures for saving the remaining amounts will
appear like child’s play. That is, if we can eliminate the largest
factor in England’s policy of exploitation, it will not be very
difficult to eliminate the rest. I am convinced that, when this ideal
state has been realized,England, with no material interests to serve,
will not keep its army here and retain its other powers by force.</p>

Let us know examine this mater from another angle. For winning
swaraj, we need honesty, unity, firmness, organizing power, capacity
to build up national trade countrywide spirit of patriotism,
indomitable cou-rage and spirit of self-sacrifice. The spinning-wheel
will be revived throu-ghout the country only when we can show all
these qualities. No power on earth can keep in bondage a nation which
can display these qualities.</p>

carried out the boycott of foreign cloth, we shall be able to issue

the ultimatum—does not respect our wishes, we  shall  be  strong

It is true that we had the spinning-wheel in Clive's time. We had not
been enslaved then, but the process had begun. As the spinning- wheel
increasingly fell into disuse, we became more and more enslaved, or,

crippling us.</p>

The same gentleman says in another letter that I have been collecting
cash, jewellery, etc., and that people have faith in me; but, he
asks, what would happen to all this collection when I might not be in
a position to exercise control over everyone or if my connection with
the swaraj movement came to an end ? This question is an important as
the previous one. Whatever I receive in cash  and jewellery during my

concerned keep accounts of the same. To be exact, the collection in

Committees are bound to keep accounts of all funds and to publish
them and are subject to the control of the All-India Congress
Committee in the matter. Thus, the chances of any misappropriation of
these funds are the fewest. What more than this can be done? I admit
that much of the money being received is owing to the people’s
regard for me at present. But the people’s faith in the work
proposed to be done with it and, equally with this, the greatness of
the person whose memory we wish to perpetuate, are also responsible
for the contributions. Every precaution has been taken to see that
the money is spent well. An account of the amounts collected in
Gujarat will soon be published, and similar accounts will continue to

One Shri Juthabhai Shivji has addressed an “Open letter” to me.
This is its substance. He says that, if Hindus listen to my speeches

it was the <i>Antyajas</i><i> </i>whose absence I regretted,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

tell those who think as Shri Juthabhai does that the regret I
expressed was for the absence of Hindu who look upon themselves as
orthodox. My speech coout that their absence was not at all due to
fears occasioned by false runtained an appeal to them and that is why
I wished that they had been present.</p>

It it is true, however, that <i>Antyajas </i>were not present in
large numbers because of their lack of faith, that fact also is to be
regretted. They need to have faith in themselves alone. The object of
holding the <i>Antyaj </i>conferences was to influence the <i>Antyajas
</i>much more than to influence Hindu society as a whole. Many of the
resolutions passed pertained to internal reforms. I hope, therefore,
that <i>Antyaj </i>friends will not, owing to any such
misunderstanding, keep away from con- ferences in future.</p>

argument of Shri Juthabhai; there is, however, a serious flaw in it.
The struggle for swaraj is a movement for emancipating ourselves from
our sins. Self-purification mean being free form sins. So long as the
<i>Antyajas</i>’ untouchability has not ended, that of he Hindus
will not end either. The one is int-imately connected with the other.
How  can swaraj ever be won so long as the sinful practice of
treating  the <i>Antyajas </i>as untouchables is not given up? I
think, therefore, that those of Shri Juthabhai’s way of thinking
need to keep patience and take full part in this movement for swaraj.
It is not other Hindus who will grant swaraj to <i>Antyajas</i>; they
will win their own swaraj. Noone who understands the idea of swaraj
will fail to see the need for non-co- operation.</p>

Describing my experiences in Gujarat, I had remarked on the Kalol
<i>mahajans,</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>regard for <i>Antyajas</i>. Afterwards, however, I came
to know that they were so enraged at my visit to the <i>Antyaj
</i>locality, that they said harsh things about it and many of them
even took a bath by way of expiation. I was sorry to learn all this.
I have been told that one cause for their anger was that, after my
departure, some persons forcibly got <i>Antyajas </i>admitted into
the <i>pandal </i>. If anybody did this, I would consider that also
wrong. We can progress only by tolerating one another's views, right
or wrong. Those who took a bath and those who said harsh things about
me were within their rights. People who regard it as a sin to touch
<i>Antyajas </i>cannot be convinced of their error by force. he sin
of untouchability can be washed clean only by being patient with them
and explaining to them the meaning of dharma. The only lesson that I
want to draw from this incident is that nobody, lured by the prospect
of Swaraj or in order to please me, need keep back his views or
suppress his feelings and touch <i>Antyajas</i>. We  can profit from
a thing only by doing it thoughtfully and with full understanding.
Misplaced regard for others, fear and the like also obstruct swaraj.</p>

So, Swami Govindanand has got five years’ transportation. He has a
tough back. He has undergone previous incarceration without trial. He
has put on record his experiences of the tortures he had to put up
with in the various goals in which he was placed. He has now gone
through the farce of a trial and has been duly convicted. Does the
transportation on that account carry and weight, or does it not
rather show the hypocrisy of the whole transaction? The form is
changed, the spirit remains the same. What is wanted is a change of
the spirit. “Handsome is that handsome does.” I have read the
full next to the Swami’s speech. It contains some bitter and
offensive language but nothing out of the ordinary. Certainly there
is no incitement to violence in it. Disaffection there is. But if he
deserved prosecution for uttering disaffection, I am as guilty as
Swami Govindanand. I have probably the greatest disaffection for the
existing system of</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Government. For nobody has perhaps the same horror of the system that
I have. One would think that disaffection was an established common
fact in India and that so long as the speakers did not incite to
violence, they were to be free from the attentions of the police. But
the worst of this Government is that it has no consistent policy. The
late Mr. Chamberlain<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>used to pride himself on reiterating his belief that a
British official’s word was as good as a bond. We know by painful
experience that, to-day, a British Government’s bond is  worth  no
more than waste paper. Happily, India was under no delusion when Sir
William Vincent pompously pronounced the sentences conveying to the
Indian ear the assurance that non-co-operators were to be left
undisturbed so long as there was no incitement to violence. The
assurance only meant that non-co-operators were to be left
undisturbed so long as their propaganda did not result in effective
action. Now that we have gone far beyond the stage of mere
demonstration, we need or expect freedom from imprisonment or worse.
The more he movement tells, the greater must the repression be. Five
years’ transportation is clearly intended to produce  a theatrical
effect. Five years in the life of India to-day mean, I do not know,
how many ages. I India is as good as her word, she would have
acquired the power long before the expiry of the period to discharge
all prisoners unjustly detained. But whether that event is far or
near, our duty is clear. We must answer every imprisonment not with
anger, as in Malegaon, but with quiet courage and determination. We
must prosecute, if we are true to our creed, still more vigorously
that  concrete constructive programme of the All-India Congress
Committee to its full fruition. We must not indulge in empty or
provoking demonstrations at each arrest. We must not indulge in
bravado. We must seek imprisonment for doing solid work.</p>

I observe that there is a tendency to minimize the guilt of the
non-co-operators at Malegaon. No amount of provocation by the sub-
inspector could possibly justify retaliation by the non-co-operators.
I am not examining the case from the legal standpoint. I am concerned
only with the non-co-operator's. He is bound under his oath not to
retaliate even under he gravest provocation. We have the brilliant
instance of Sardars Lachhman Singh and Dulip Singh and their party.</p>

If we are true non-co-operators, we must develop the power of dying
as they died. I would have hailed with joy the immolation of Male-
gaon non-co-operators if they had died bravely and without providing
any justification. That would have brought the day of India’s
freedom nearer. As it was, who gave the first provocation, again,
from the non- co-operator’s standpoint? Did they or did they not
try to overawe the police? These delirious demonstrations when any of
us is arrested are, as I have already observed before, an unseemly
exhibition of our anxiety to avoid imprisonment. We have chosen a
standard of judgment for ourselves and we must abide by it. I retain
the opinion that the non-co-operators, so far as the facts hitherto
brought to light show, committed a grievous breach of the code of
non-violent non- co-operation. I would ask the public who are
interested in the Khilafat or swaraj, religiously to refrain from <i>all
</i>demonstrations over the arrest or imprisonment of even their
dearest leaders. I would hold it no honour to me for the public to
proclaim a hartal or hold meetings if I was arrested or Maulana
Shaukat Ali for that matter. I would welcome and expect in any such
event a complete immediate boycott of all foreign cloth, a more
energetic adoption of the spinning-wheel, a more vigorous collection
in behalf of the Tilak Swaraj Fund and a flooding of Congress offices
for registration as members. I would certainly expect the emptying of
Government schools and colleges and more suspensions of practice by
lawyers. Killing officers and burning buildings will no only retard
he advent of swaraj and the righting of the khilafat and the Punjab
wrongs, but are likely to lead to utter demoralization of the nation.
We must therefore scrupulously avoid all occasions which would excite
the passions of the mob and lead them into undesirable or criminal
conduct.</p>

Often do young men criticize the conduct of leaders without just
cause. The latest instance that has come to my notice is rather
striking. A special train was arranged for a visit to Mirpur Khas
from Hydera- bad during my recent visit to Sind. This was too much
for a correspondent. He thought that the leaders had indulged in a
waste of national funds. I had not stopped to inquire the reason why
the special was arranged. He advised me to cancel the special and
give a day more to Sind and save the money. If he had inquired into
the matter, the friend would have discovered that without the special
it was impossible to take me to Mirpur Khas, that I could not have
given a day more to Sind Without disturbing the rest of the
programme, that it</p>

was necessary for me to go to Mirpur Khas and that the expense was
comparatively small. Criticism of public men is a welcome sign of
public awakening. It keeps workers on the alert. Those who pay have a
right to ensure economy. There is undoubtedly an extravagance often
noticed about popular demonstrations, much money is spent in tinsel
splendour. The expense is often thought-less. And we are likely to
gain by fearless criticism of public expenditure or general conduct
of public men. But all such criticism must be well informed and
thoughtful. All carping criticism must be avoided.</p>

Whilst on the question of railway travelling, I must remark that
there is still a noticeable desire to avoid 3rd class travelling. I
am sorry to say that, being no longer physically able to travel 3rd
class, I am deprived of the inestimable experiences of 3rd class
railway travelling. It affords an opportunity of contact with the
national mind which nothing else does. It enables one to render
service which cannot be otherwise rendered. I would therefore urge
all workers to avoid 2nd class travelling save in rare cases. No one
perhaps knows better than I do the discomfort of 3rd class railway
travelling. I put it down partly to callous railway management and
partly to bad national habits that ignore the convenience of the
neighbours. Observant workers travelling 3rd class would efficiently
deal with the disregard both of the management and the passengers.
There is no doubt that 2nd class travelling is not within the reach
of the masses. And national servants may claim no privileges not
enjoyed by the latter.</p>

That unity is strength is not merely a copybook maxim but a rule of

 the   problem   confronted   me   in   a concrete shape. The
relations between the two were none too happy. They fought only about
two years ago over what appeared to me to be  a small matter. It was
the eternal question of playing music whilst passing mosques. I hold
that we may not dignify every trifle into a matter of deep religious
importance. Therefore, a Hindu may not insist on play- ing music
whilst passing a mosque. He may no even quote precedents in his own
or any other place for the sake of playing music. It is not a mater
of vital importance for him to play music whilst passing a mosque.
One can easily appreciate the Mussulman sentiment of having solemn
silence near a mosque the whole of the twenty four hours. What is a
non-essential to a Hindu may be an essential to a Mussulman. And in
all non-essential matters a Hindu must yield for the asking. It is
criminal folly to  quarrel  over trivialities. The unity we desire
will last only if we cultivate a yielding and a charitable
disposition towards one another. The cow is as dear as life to a
Hindu; the Mussulman should therefore voluntarily accommodate his
Hindu brother. Silence at his prayer is a precious thing for a
Mussulman. Every Hindu should voluntarily respect his Mussulman
brother’s sentiment. This however is a counsel of per- fection.
There are nasty Hindus as there are nasty Mussulmans who would pick a
quarrel for nothing. For these we must provide <i>pancha- </i><i>yats
</i>of unimpeachable probity and imperturbability whose decisions
must be binding on both parties. Public opinion should be cultivated
in favour of the decisions of such <i>panchayats </i>so that no one
would question them.</p>

I know that there is much, too much distrust of one another as yet.
Many Hindus distruct Mussulman honesty. They believe that swaraj
means Mussulman raj, for they argue that without the British,
Mussulmans of India will aid Mussulman powers to build  a Mussulman
empire in India. Mussulmans on the other hand fear that the Hindus,
being in an overwhelming majority, will smother them. Such an
attitude of mind betokens impotence on either’s part. If not their
nobility, their desire to live in peace would dictate a policy of
mutual trust and mutual forbearance. There is nothing in either
religion to keep the two apart. The days of forcible conversion are
gone. Save for the cow, Hindus can have no ground for quarrel with
Mussulmans. The latter are under no religious obligation to slaughter</p>

The correspondent seems to ignore the fact that the propaganda of
hand-spinning involves that of hand-weaving. India cannot be self-
contained for her clothing if the hand-spun yarn could not be hand-
woven. But the mere multiplying of handlooms cannot solve the
problem. The art of hand-weaving is not dead. There are today more
handlooms working in India than power-looms. But they mostly weave
foreign yarn. I heartily support the proposition that we should use
only coarse cloth and induce the weavers to weave only Indian yarn.
The correspondent should also have advised ‘the  leaders’  to</p>

appeal to the mill-owners not to export yarn at all. Only it is well
nigh impossible to induce the mill-owners to forego the larger
profits they make by exporting yarn. If only the mill-owners and the
other capitalists took it into their heads, they could certainly
bring about a complete boycott of foreign cloth during this year. But
even so the problem of hand-spinning remains. It is not enough merely
to bring about boycott of foreign cloth. It is absolutely necessary
to give the millions of the peasantry a supple-mentary industry. They
 must utilize, as they did before, their spare hours in some
occupation supplementary to agriculture. The millions who are living
in semi- starvation for want of occupation must find an easy one in
their own homes. This is again hand-spinning. What the correspondent
urges is going on. The number of handlooms is increasing, the people
are taking less to wearing coarse cloth. But universal hand-spinning
alone can immediately solve the problem of the growing poverty of the
masses. Let me put my conviction still more strongly. India cannot
become a contented, fearless, and self-supporting India without hand-
spinning. It is therefore that Mr. Krishna Rao of Masulipatam
instinctively recognized the duty (dharma) of hand-spinning as a
sacramental rite. The masses with their clear imagination have

Writing under the pseudonym "Swadeshi", a friend asks me
several candid questions. For my information, he has given his name
too. He is an educated man and his questions deserve attention. He
asks:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 1.05cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Q. Is not every delegate who joined in unanimously passing the
non-co-operation resolution bound to implement it, not by stages, but
immediately?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">A.	Certainly,
he is.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Q. If he is and yet does not act accordingly, may it not be that such
a delegate takes non-co-operation to be merely a toy to play with? Do
not such people deceive themselves and others?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
A. They certainly do. Not only that, they even harm the non-
co-operation movement. They do not carry out the condition of their
soldiership. Where the minimum height prescribed for recruitment is
five feet, a person four feet tall is not wanted. In the same way,
those who continue to be soldiers of the non-co-operation army but do
not carry out its conditions commit uncivil disobedience of its law
and are guilty of a crime.</p>

A. The people’s test is not yet over. If, however, a majority of
non-co-operators remain unchanged even after the 30th June, I would
certainly be unhappy. But my optimism would not suffer. As long as I
am sure of myself, my optimism will not give way. Moreover, taking
everybody else to be like me, I believe that all people will adopt
what appears to be the natural and right course. The impostors will
leave the movement of their own accord.</p>

ould I offer it to weak delegates? This being a struggle for self-
purification, it has no room whatsoever or holding up anyone to 
public contempt. But such persons may certainly be subjected to a
boycott, that is, may be debarred from being delegates, volunteers or
office-holders. I believe that the atmosphere is getting cleaner day
by day. There are only a few committees now in which lawyers who have
not given up practice still hold any office. There are hardly any
students still continuing in Government schools and servingas volun-
teers. It seems everyone is beginning to understand  his  own
limitations.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
A. I have no follower. Or, he is my follower who not only accepts my
principles but puts them into practice. There is therefore no sense
in describing anyone not acting according to my principles as a
follower of mine. A ‘follower’ of mine needs no certificate.
Everyone will recognize him. He is no ‘follower’ of mine who does
not speak the truth and does not act according to truth, who does not
strive to be compassionate in speech, thought and action, who does
not wear khadi and does not boycott foreign cloth completely, who
does not regard the <i>Bhangi </i>as his blood-brother, who does not
look upon women other than his wife as his mothers and sisters, who
is not prepared to lay down his life for the sake of the country,
dharma, or truth and, finally, who does not realize his own
littleness and behave with humility. To the ‘admirer’ of my
principles also I would apply the same rules. The habit of keeping
practice at variance with profession and of tolerating such behaviour
has gone so deep that it has become something of a disease. If people
who are not prepared to put into practice what they preach stop
speaking, I am sure, the world would be spared much sophistry and a
good many speeches and</p>

Q. Would you accept swaraj if it is gained through the support  of
these delegates and admirers, who wax eloquent in preaching to others
what they never practise themselves? If you did, how  long would such
swaraj be preserved?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
A. There is no question at all of my accepting swaraj. It will be for
the people to do so. As a representative of the people, however, I
know that swaraj can never be won through such insincerity. The
question, therefore, whether or not it would last long does not
arise.</p>

We can see that this friend has asked all these questions in deep
sorrow. Doubts like his are bound to occur to many other honest men
and women. Every non-co-operator should try to set them at rest by
his conduct. The cause for delay in our getting swaraj lies in
ourselves.</p>

Q.  Do not some of your principles demand sacrifices which it  is
against human nature to make?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
A. Not a single item of non-co-operation  demands  such difficult
sacrifice. The sacrifices involves in non-co-operation are easy to
make and not impossible for ordinary human nature and it is because
of this, I believe, that the people have welcomed  the movement. The
main principles are : Hindu-Muslim unity, preserving peace even under
provocation, total boycott of foreign cloth, daily spinning for a
fixed period, contributing money according to one’s capacity,
treating the <i>Bhangi </i>as one’s  brother and giving up
addictions, immorality, etc. In none of these do I see <i>sannyasa</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. I have demanded nothing which other nations have not
shown themselves capable of. The requirement of peace will be
considered as something new. But the Sikhs have succeeded in meeting
it in a limited sphere. On deeper reflection we shall find that the
British have also remained peaceful whenever they wanted to. I have
gone to the length of conceding that we shall win swaraj even if we
accept the need for peace as a matter of policy, as a weapon of
expediency. The non- violence of my conception is the weapon of the
strong, of the true Kshatriya. We may, however, consider it as a
weapon of the weak.</p>

Q. If you advocate non-co-operation with the rulers, why do you

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%"><a name="65. MY NOTES"></a>
A. It is not the rulers against whom we employ non-co- operation; we
employ it against the policy followed by them. Our non-co-operation
is not directed against individuals. We have never stopped any <i>Bhangi
</i>or potter from serving an official, nor do I consider it
desirable that we should. How then can we  dissuade <i>Bhangis </i>and
others from serving our brethren who, holding views different from
ours, enter Councils? We wish to win over everybody through love. If
you would not have it that way, at any rate, we do not want to force
anybody to be on our side but want to propagate our views by
awakening people’s reason and pleading with them. Non- cooper-ation
springs not from hatred but from love, not from weakness but from
strength, not from falsehood but from truth, not from blind faith but
from faith based on knowledge, from enlightened judgment and from
reason; it does no spring from <i>adharma </i>but from dharma, from
faith in oneself.</p>

Government is. But, even in Indian States, we can take up the
movement against drink, giving up drink ourselves and persuading
others to do so. We may certainly introduce spinning-wheels and start
spinning. Even there, we may certainly give up using foreign cloth
and wear khadi; we can, likewise, give up gambling, immorality, etc;
we can enrol ourselves as Congress members and contribute hand somely
to the Tilak Swaraj Fund. The entire amount can be raised by the
residents of Indian States if they choose to make the effort. Anyone
who labours to get these things done will have done much or swaraj.

Even in British India, however, is it necessary to go on criticizing
British rule? Personally, I feel that we would be showing our culture
in eschewing all criticism. Whatever criticism is necessary, I make
myself. Let me assure readers of <i>Navajivan </i>that I never fail
to criticize the Government whenever criticism is called for. But we
cannot mend or end this Empire by denouncing it; we shall succeed in
our aim only by doing our duty and reforming ourselves. We have so
much to do by way of spinning, enrolling members of the Congress and
collecting contributions for the Tilak Swaraj Fund that we can spare
no time for other things. We can complete the programme of work by

I have even grown weary of the crowds on railway platforms and of
their shouting. These things will not bring us swaraj. The time for
them is over. They may have been necessary when there was no
awaken-ing among the people. But now there is no lack of it. We have
now control of the Niagara Falls. We have also discovered how to put
them to use. What we have to do now is simply to work on silently to</p>

If it is no more necessary to criticize the Government, it is not
necessary to criticize co-operators either. Our criticism consists in
our work. It is the experience everywhere in the world that an ounce
of practice achieves more than a ton of preaching. Speeches  often 
mirror our deficiencies in regard to practice. The man who talks much
hardly acts upon what he says. He who is particular about keeping his
word weighs every sentence he utters. Moreover, now that we address
our demands not to the Government but to ourselves, whatever 
criticism we make or discontent we feel should be against ourselves.</p>

A gentleman from Bhavnagar, who has given his name, reports some
painful things about the Jain Girls School there. It is some time
that the letter has been with me but, owing to my constant touring, I
cannot cope with my correspondence as fast as I would wish. Though he
has given me permission to publish his name, I refrain from doing so
as I do not want to make him a target of undeserved criticism in
Bhavnagar. I know that we have not yet acquired the strength to
tolerate criticism even when it is well-meant. Swarajists must, on
the contrary, learn to bear with malicious criticism even. This
friend says that, even on the sacred day of April 6, a crowd of
non-co-operators invaded the Girls’ School there to get is closed.
If just one of them had approached the authorities with a polite
request, there would have been nothing to say against the step.But,
according to the corres- pondent, a whole crowd invaded the place and
the leader peremptorily demanded that the school be closed. The Head
Master started arguing and was answered with a hail of brickbats. One
girl was injured on the head and another was slightly bruised. Just
then, fortunately,a non-co- operator who understood the need for
remaining peaceful came to the place. He stopped the rain of
brick-bats and the attempted coercion. I congratulate this friend.
What shall I write about the others? If the account given above is
true, they brought discredit on the 6th, broke their pledge and
utterly forgot themselves. How can we, who wish to be saved from the
policy of making people virtuous by force, coerce anyone?</p>

The correspondent who reported this incident says that, despite this
harassment, the authorities of the School  studiously  refrained from
calling in the police for help. I congratulate them on exercising
this restraint. Those who violate peace are not non-co-operators,

This statement appears in my message for the Satyagraha Week. Shri
Rajabali Jhinabhai protests that most people will not understand the
meaning of this remark, that it gives the impression that I was even
limiting the power of God and may, therefore, have hurt religious-
minded people. I count myself a religious-minded man. I believe in
the reality of God. I have merely stated a plain fact in plain
language and drawn atten-tion of God’s law. God has reserved no
freedom for Himself to grant a place in heaven to a sinner. One can
say that, after laying down His laws, God left things to take their
own course. It is because He is Almighty that He has created laws
which admit of no exceptions. Swaraj is a state of being of
individuals and nations. Just as only a person who eats will have his
hunger satisfied, so he alone can be free who throws off subjection.
If we do not give up drink and do not discard foreign cloth, if
Hindus and Muslims continue fighting with each other, would God make
us a gift of swaraj? Can He? Conversely, if, through force of public
opinion, we successfully boycott foreign cloth and put a stop to the
consumption of liquor, can we fail to win swaraj? Can anybody
persistently transgressing God's laws hope that God will give him a
place in heaven? Surely, none. Hence, even our prayer should be not
for swaraj but for strength to win it. The very meaning of prayer is
the expression of intense longing for a particular goal or state.</p>

again reverted to the essential necessity of casting off distrust
from their hearts by the Hindus and Mohammedans and spoke on the
second essential, Hindu- Muslim unity. The entente between them was
never entered into in a bargaining spirit. The Hindus espoused the
Muslims’ cause, because they knew it was their duty and because
they knew that nobility could only be answered by nobility. It was
fatal, therefore, to compel the Mussulmans to give up cow-killing.
They were not the only culprits in the matter and the question of
cow-protection was never going to be decided by the arbitrament of
force. Implicit trust of and hearty co-operation with the Mussalmans
would gain in the end everything. Islam was broad-based on nobility,
and it would not endure if it gave up its nobility.</font></font></p>

Will our talks yield any result ? They may or they may not, the
chances are even. We have to pray for God’s help to achieve what we
wish to. I explained our case to the Viceroy and he listened to me
for many hours with great patience and affection. I, too, listened to
what he had to say. I heard him explain the difficulties of the
British Government. I can only say this—if we adhere to the solemn
decla- ration made, with God as witness at the Congress session, the
Sikh League and the Khilafat conferences, we shall certainly achieve
our cherished goal during this year. Nothing is in the hands of the
Viceroy. Don’t keep on asking what news cables from England bring.
Our fight is for honour and justice, and we have to show to the world
that we are ready to die for winning justice. God grants nothing
without testing us and, before we can get anything, we must emerge
successful from the test. Even the worst scoundrel is ready to do
anything to get what he wants; you six-foot tall Punjabis, then, if
you do not want to crawl again on your stomachs, if not even one
amongst you desired to rub his nose on the ground, learn the lesson
which our Sikh brethren have taught. Be ready, like them, to stake
your head in a righteous cause. Do not be murderers, like Mahant
Naraindas. You cannot win swaraj by killing anyone; you cannot solve
the Punjab and the Khilafat questions that way. Not by taking
anyone’s blood but only by giving your own, by acquiring the
strength of Lachhman Singh can you succeed in these things.</p>

I tell you, as long as you are scared of your holy places being
polluted or dishonoured by Pathans, you had better bury your <i>Hardwar

able to fight the Pathans, but, instead of running away, you ought to
have in you the strength to stand up against them and die. Have no
fear of the Afghans, nor of the Muslims; fear God alone. Even in the
days of the Prophet, some timid people, seeing the oncoming hordes,
told him that they were only a  few and asked him  in fear how they
could fight. The Prophet’s reply was, ‘‘No, you are not alone;
God is with you.’’ I, too, say to you, do not think your- selves
weak. If you are brave, the Afghans also will behave well towards
you. I know the Afghans. In South Africa, I had many of them as my
clients. I have had experience of their sense of honour. I think even
bad ones among them fear God. If you regard the Muslims as your
brethren, if you trust them, have no fear of the pathans at all. If
they come to attack us, I shall be with you to employ non-co-</p>

India be seized by them. God will give me strength at that time to

</font></sup>. There is a favourite saying among lawyers, almost
enjoying the dignity of a maxim, that hard cases make a bad law. I
know to my cost how true the saying is. Many a judge has been obliged
to give a decision apparently unjust but perfectly sound in law.
Similarly, one may say that hard cases make bad non-co-operation. My
business as an economical journalist is to deal with such matters
only as have bearing on the one issue before the country. If I
mention Mr. Horniman’s case or that of the Savarkar Brothers, I can
mention it not to influence the Government's decision, but to
stimulate the public in favour of non-co-operation. I would be
delighted to have Mr.Horni- man back as an able and brave comrade. I
know that he was unjustly deported. The Savarkar Brothers' talent
should be utilized for public welfare. As it is, India is in danger
of losing her two faithful sons, unless she wakes up in time. One of
the brothers I know well. I had the pleasure  of meeting him in
London.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>He is brave. He is clever. He is a patriot. He was
frankly a revolutionary. The evil, in its hideous form, of the
present system of Government, he saw much earlier than I did, He is
in the Andamans for his having loved India too well. Under  a just
Government, he would be occupying a high office. I there-fore feel
for him and his brother. Had it not been for non-co-operation. Mr.
Horniman would have returned and the brothers would have been
discharged long ago. Now non-co-operation blocks the way. Those who
are really interested in the release of the brothers and such others
as are suffering imprisonment and in the return of Mr. Horniman, must
hasten the fulfilment of the non-co-operation programme and therefore
the advent of swaraj. Meanwhile, we must not only put up with the
existing incarcerations, but we must seek imprisonment ourselves, by
offending the Government in all just, lawful and peace- ful ways.</p>

I have read a notice issued by the Collector of the Allahabad
District that Government servants must not wear the Gandhi cap. I
would advise every Government servant to wear these beautiful light,
inoffensive caps , and brave dismissal and even imprisonment. I was
told whilst in Allahabad the overzealous servants of the Government
have even been telling poor people that, if they introduce the spin-
ning-wheel into their homes, they will be prosecuted. If a spinning-
wheel can by any possibility be turned into a seditious article, its
possession will be another honourable method of seeking imprison-
ment.</p>

Whilst the U.P. Government is crossing the bounds of pro- priety, and
intimidating people, there is little doubt that the <i>kisans </i>too
are not making wise use of their newly-found power, In several
zemindaris, they are said to have overstepped the mark, taken the law
into their own hands and to have become impatient of anybody who
would not do as they wish. They are abusing social boycott and are
turning it into an instrument of violence. They are reported to have
stopped the supply of water, barber, and other paid services to their
zemindars in some instances and even suspended payment to the rent
due to them. The <i>kisan </i>movement has received an impetus from
non- co-operation, but it is anterior to and independent to it.
Whilst we will not hesitate to advise the <i>kisans </i>when the
moment comes to suspend payment of taxes to the Government, it is not
contemplated that at any stage of non-co-operation we would seek to
deprive the zemindars of their rent. The <i>kisan </i>movement must
be confined to the improvement to the status of the <i>kisans </i>and
the betterment of the relations between the zemindars and them. The
<i>kisans </i>must be advised scrupulously to abide by the terms of
their agreement with the zemindars, whether such agreement is written
or inferred from custom. Where a custom or even a written contract is
bad, they may not try to uproot it by vio- lence or without previous
reference to the zemindars. In every case there should be a friendly
discussion with the zemindars and an</p>

It is high time that we disciplined ourselves. The demonstrations at
railway stations are becoming a menace to the comfort of the
travelling public. I am old that some railway passengers who, only a
short time before a station demonstration, were praising me, were,
after one or two demonstrations any intermediate stations, heard to
curse me. I sympathize with them. I had a fellow-passenger with me
during the Allahabad journey. Owing to the pressure of the crowds
that besiged the station, he was unable to get a cut of tea for go
out or his refreshments. I should not at all be surprised if he
considered me to be a plague. On my way back from Allahabad, there
was an un- manageable crowd on the kanpur platform, yelling the
national cries, pressing towards my compartment and making everybody
uncom- fortable. The noise continued the whole time. The leaders were
with difficulty able to make the crowd sit, but it could not be made
to stop shouting and yelling. I was asked to stand near the door to
give <i>dar- </i><i>shan</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

me, I resolutely refused to stir out of my seat unless there was 
perfect silence.</p>

This din, noise and bustle was due purely to want of fore- thought,
management and organization. It is best now to avoid all
demonstrations a stations. We must consult the convenience of the
passengers. If there must be a demonstration, national cries must be
regulated every facility must be provided for the easy movement of
passengers. The nation must be disciplined to handle mass movements
in a sober and methodical manner. This means previous training of
volunteers and previous discipline of the masses. It is not
impossible to give an elementary training in a few days. Wherever the
people have been previously instructed, they have responded
wonderfully well. Without this training, we never know when there
might be an accident. It is the innate good nature of the people that
has saved us hitherto from mishaps. But under proper training, we
should be able to feel absolutely safe and comfortable in the midst

A friend has just drawn my attention to a resolution passed by the
Sikh League inviting me to include the Sikh black colour in the
national flag. These friends forget that all other colours are repre-
sented on the white strip. We must not be parochial, provincial or
clannish. Hindu and Mussulman colours are specially represented, not
so much for the numbers they represent, as for the fact that they
have remained apart for so long and that their mutual distrust has
been an effectual bar against the realization of national
aspirations. The Sikhs have never had any quarrel with Hindus. And if
one has the Sikh colour separately represented, why not the Parsi,
the Christian and the Jewish? I hope the Sikh Leaguers will see the
unpractical nature of their suggestion.</p>

I have been flooded with letters suggesting changes in the pro- posed
national flag. I am unable to publish the voluminous corres-
pondence. There is nothing striking in any of the letters. Some
deplore the want of artistic beauty about the flag, others would make
additions representing Hindu and Mohammedan symbols. The critics have
missed the central idea. We must not have any religious symbols and
we must find a clear and permanant rallying object. That is the
spinning-wheel, according to the vast majority who believe with me
that we lost our liberty with the loss of the spinning-wheel, and we
can only regain it when we have revived the spinning-wheel and
rejected foreign cloth.</p>

Many friends who send me urgent wires may consider me to be
discourteous in that they get no replies to their wires. The fact is
that the telegraph department at Ahmedabad seems to have received
ins- tructions to delay delivery of my telegrams. The authorities
have the right, if they choose, to put such obstacles in my way. And
our move- ment must be capable of being carried on independently of
the use of public departments controlled by the Government. I would
advise correspondents not to waste money in sending wires, but
tran-sact all their business with me through the post, so long as the
regular delivery to me of the post is continued by the Government.</p>

Is not my article on the Afghan   Bogey<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>an
 invitation  to  the Afghans to invade the Indian border, and thus do
I not become a direct party to violence? Thus asks Mr. Andrews. My
article  was  written or Indians and for the Government. I do not
believe the Afghans to be so foolish as to invade India on the
strength of my article. But I see that it is capable to bearing the
interpretation put upon it by Mr. Andrews. I therefore hasten to
inform all whom it may concern that not only do I not want to invite
the Afghans or anybody to come to our assistance, but am anxious for
them not to come to our assistance. I am quite confident of India's
ability to settle with the Government without extraneous help.
Moreover, I am interested in demonstrating the perfect possibility o
attaining our end only by non- violent means. I would therefore
strain every nerve to keep  the Afghans out of the Indian border, but
my anxiety to keep them off the Indian border will not go so far as
to assist the Government with men or money.</p>

In my article I have put my position as clearly as possible. For me
the existing Government is the most intolerable of all, it is the
greatest danger to the manhood of India and I would welcome its <i>re-
</i><i>formation </i>at any cost. It is my settled conviction that it
is a godless Government. That there are good Englishmen and good
Indians connected with it makes it all the more dangerous for India.
It keeps the nation's eyes off the inherent evil of it. My attack is
not against individuals, it is directed against the system, against
the aggregate called the Government. The best of viceroys have been
powerless to cradicate the poison of the system. The poison is its
foundation. Therefore, I can reconcile myself to all the worst that
can happen to India in the place of the present system.</p>

What however I would do is totally different from what I can do. I am
sorry to have to confess that the movement has not yet acquired such
hold on the soldier class as to embolden them to refuse assistance to
the government in time of need. When the soldier class has realized
that it lives for he nation, and that it is a travesty if a soldier's
calling when he undertakes to kill to order, the battle of India's
worldly freedom is won without more. As it is, the Indian soldier is
as much subject to fear as the layman. He fills the recruiting ranks
because he</p>

believes that there is no other means of livelihood . The Government
has made the profession of killing attractive by a system of special
rewards, and, by a system of skilfully devised punishments, has made
it well-nigh impossible for the soldier, once he is in, to get out
without difficulty. In these circumstances I do not delude myself
with the belief that the British Government will be without Indian
help in the event of an immediate Afghan invasion. But it was my
duty, especially when challenged, to put before the nation the
position logically aris- ing from non-co-operation. It was necessary,
too, to warn the nation against being frightened by the Afghan bogey.</p>

The second part of the question contains, in my opinion, a
misconception of non-violence. It is no part of the duty of a non-
violent non-co-operator to assist the Government against war made
upon it by others. A non-violent non-co-operator may not secretly or
openly encourage or assist any such war. He may not take  part
directly or indirectly in it. But it is no part of his duty to help
the Government to end the war. On the contrary his prayer would be,
as  it must be, for the defeat of at power which he seeks to destroy.
I, therefore, so are as my creed of non-violence is concerned, can
con- template an Afghan invasion with perfect equanimity, and equally
so far as India's safety is concerned. The Afghans have no quarrel
with India. They are a godfearing people. I warn non-co-operators
against judging the Afghans by the few savage specimens we see in
Bombay or Calcutta. It is a superstition to suppose that they will
overrun India if the British post at the frontier was withdrawn. Let
us remember that there is nothing to prevent them from overrunning
India today, if they wished to. But they are as fond of their country
as we claim to be fond of ours. I must devote a separate article to
an examina-tion of the difficult problem that faces the residents
near the frontier.</p>

Bihar is the land of promise for non-co-operation. For the
Hindu-Muslim unity of Bihar is proverbial. I was therefore distressed
to find that the unity was suffering a strain which might almost
prove unbearable. I was told by all responsible leaders—both Hindu
and Mohammedan—who are not given to be panicky, that it was taxing
their resources to the utmost to avoid a  Hindu-Mussulman 
disturbance. They informed me that certain Hindus, by name</p>

Gangaram Sharma, Bhutanath and Vidyanand, for instance, had told the
people that I had prohibited the use of meat to any Hindus or
Mussulmans and that meat and fish were even forcibly taken away from
people by over-zealous vegetarians. I know that unlawful use is being
made of my name in many places, but this is the most novel method of
misusing it. It is generally known that I am a staunch vegetarian and
food reformer. But it is not equally generally known that ahimsa
extends as much to human beings as to lower animals and that I freely
associate with meat-eaters.</p>

I would not kill a human being for protecting a cow, as I will not
kill a cow for saving a human life, be it ever so precious. Needless
to say I have authorized no one to preach vegetarianism as part of
non- co-operation. I do not know the persons named above. I am sure
that our purpose will be defeated if propaganda of any kind is
accompanied by violence. Hindus may not compel Mussulmans to abstain
from meat or even beef-eating. Vegetarian Hindus may not compel other
Hindus to abstain from fish, flesh for fowl. I would not make India
sober at the point of the sword. Nothing has lowered the morale of
the nation so much as violence. Fear has become the part of the
national character. Non-co-operators will make a serious mistake if
they seek to convert people to their creed by violence. They will
play into the hands of the Government if they use the slightest
coercion towards anybody in the the course of their propaganda.</p>

The cow question is a big question. The greatest for a Hindu. I yield
to no one in my regard for the cow. Hindus do not fulfill their trust
so long as they do not possess the ability to protect the cow. That
ability can be derived either from body-force or  soul-force.  To
attempt cow-protection by violence is to reduce Hinduism to Satanism
and to prostitute to a base end the grand significance of cow-protec-
tion. As a Mussulman friend writes, beef-eating, which is merely
permissible in Islam, will become a duty if compulsion is resorted to
by Hindus. The latter can protect the cow only by developing the
faculty for dying, for suffering. The only chance Hindus have, of
saving the cow in India from the butcher's knife, is by trying to
save Islam from the impending peril and trusting their Mussulman
countrymen to return nobility, i.e., voluntarily to protect the cow
out of regard for their Hindu countrymen. The Hindus must
scrupulously refrain from using any violence against Mussulmans.
Suffering and trust are attributes of soul-force. I have heard that,
at big fairs, if a Mussulman is found in possession of cows or even
goats, he is at time</p>

forcibly dispossessed. Those, who, claiming to be Hindus, thus resort
to violence are enemies of the cow and of Hinduism. The best and the
only way to save the cow is to save the Khilafat. I hope therefore
that every non-co-operator will strain himself to the utmost to
prevent the slightest tendency to violence in any shape or form,
whether to protect the cow or any other animal or to effect any other
purpose.</p>

Today we are fighting the mightiest Empire known. We have three big
tasks to accomplish, but our ways do not suggest that we are serious
about anything. From the spectacle today, it occurred to me that, if
this is how we were working everywhere in the country, India was not
fit for swaraj. I bathe in the ocean of love at every place in the
country. But love is of no avail until its fire products strength. I
do not like being worshipped and I do not like my feet being touched
in reverence. The practice is very hateful to me. It can only bring
about India's degra- dation. The country will not win swaraj through
this touching of feet. I want to see India stand erect. I wish to see
it stand up thus before all the countries in the world. I want no
Gandhi-raj, I want no one's raj, I want only swaraj. I do not,
therefore, want people to touch my feet in reverence.</p>

you use it at all? You thought that, along with flowers, a ribbon
would add to the beauty; this shows that, in India, our ways of doing
things are a curious mixture. The Congress has been showing how we
can get out of these. There is no propriety and no thoughtfulness in
what you do. Do you revere Tilak Maharaj? He has given us one holy
word, and one alone, and he passed away with that word on his lips.
The legacy bequeathed by Tilak Maharaj is for the whole of India, but
your responsibility is greater than that of people in other parts of
the country. What answer will you give to his soul on August 1? If
you do nothing else, at any rate adopt complete swadeshi and give up
the use of foreign articles in temples. I tell the temple priests
that I feel unhappy when they take me to a temple decorated with
foreign cloth.</p>

Simla is named after Mother Shimala, as Mumbai [Bombay] is named
after Mumbadevi and Calcutta after Kali. All the three goddesses have
proved faithless or, maybe, the devotees  have  forgotten them. The
mere thought of the Kali temple fills me with horror. How can the
place be called a temple at all? In literal truth, rivers of blood
flow there every day. Who knows what the thousands of goats
slaughtered there in the name of religion say in the court of God?
How infinite is Mother Kali's patience? Does she really demand cruel

But Simla? Delhi, most certainly, is not the symbol of India's
slavery. The place which is he real headquarters of the rulers is
Simla. The Simla Municipality<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>told
the Viceroy that every year the officials formulated their policies
in the quiet and coolness of the Simla hills. We had full experience,
in the summer of 1919, of what these policies are. Even the hottest
parts of the country give an idea of the temperature of these
policies.</p>

After seeing Simla, my views have not changed. No end of money has
been spent over the place. Even a proud man like me has had to eat
humble pie. The only means of conveyance here is the horse or the
rickshaw. I never used the latter while in South Africa, but here I
did, thanks to my weakness. All, whether grown - up or young men or
women, use it. The car is justifiably prohibited. The horse- drawn
carriage can be used only by the Viceroy and one or two other
officials, and this also seems to be justified. The roads in this
place are narrow; roads cut through steep hills cannot but be so.
Naturally, the plying of horse- drawn vehicles on such roads must
perforce be restricted.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
What is strange, however, is that the rickshaw has become quite an
ordinary conveyance, as if it was he most natural thing for any of us
to be yoked to a vehicle! I asked the men who pulled the rickshaw
which carried me why they had taken up this work. Did they not have a
belly to fill? They queried in reply. I know this reply is not quite
convincing; it cannot be said, though, that they take pleasure in
becoming beasts of burden. On the contrary, my charge is that it is
we who force men to become beasts. Why should it be surprising, then,
that we have become the Empire's bullocks?</p>

It is not the British alone who use the rickshaw. We use it as freely

a month each and the fourth, their leader, gets Rs. 20. The slopes up
and down along the roads are so steep that, even though there are
four of them, the men get out of breath. The rickshaw is made to
accommodate only one person at a time. Even this is something to be
thankful for. Simla is at an altitude of 7,500 feet. If people
understand the implications of the fact that the Government is
carried on from such a height, they will know what the Empire means.
If in Bombay all the shopkeepers had their shops on the topmost floor
in the chawls, what would be the customers' plight? The fourth floor
probably goes up to a height of 60 feet. The thirty crore customers
of this Govern- ment, the country's shopkeeper, have to climb not 60
feet but 7,500 feet! Bombay, we know, cannot carry on its trade on
the fourth floor. India’s trade is carried on, actually, on the
five hundredth floor! Is it any wonder that the country starves? I
should no longer seem strange that, in the foothills of Simla, three
crore innocent children famish for want of food.</p>

Simla is all congestion. The houses are full, every one of them.
Things are bound to be dear. Even water is brought up from 2,000 feet
below. One feels embarrassed to use even so much as a jugful of
water. In the building in which we stay, we do get water but it takes
the carriers, fetching it over a long distance, a whole day to fill
enough for our needs. There are no streams in the vicinity of Simla.
To win swaraj means to oblige the Government—whether it is British
or Indian—to descend from the five hundredth floor to the ground
floor and introduce naturalness in its relations with us. The
discrimination is not as between white and coloured, but as between
high and low. He is a true Brahmin who serves a <i>Bhangi</i>, and
not the one who rides on the shoulders of one. He is no king who
maintains a distance, the height of five hundred floors between him
and the subjects. It is in virtue of one's deeds in the past life
that one is born for happiness or suffering, as king or beggar. The
happy man exerts himself to relieve the suffering of others, and the
king to raise the beggar to his level, which means that though a
king, he voluntarily becomes a beggar. God, the Ruler, earns his
title to rule by making Himself the slave of his slave, makes Himself
worthy of worship by purifying the sinner. In Simla I saw the reverse
of this and my heart bled.</p>

At Panditji's request , I went to see him at Simla. His health being
indifferent, he asked me to go to him instead of himself coming over

see me. I wrote to His Excellency and told him that, if he wished to
see me, I would gladly call on him and tell him all that I had to
say. He gave me an appointment . We were together for a long time. He

Boycotting does not mean stopping the services of washermen, barbers,
etc. It means refusing to accept water or food at such person's place
and entering into no marriage connection with his family. Boycott is
of two kinds, civil and uncivil. The former has its roots in love,
the latter in hatred. In fact , hatred is another name for uncivil 
boycott. Such boycott has no place in peaceful non-co-operation and
must be altogether eschewed. The underlying idea in civil boycott is
that of refraining from accepting any services from or having any
social association with the person concerned. The idea behind the
other form is to inflict punishment and pain. We do not want  to
punish the drink-addict; we want, rather, to express our own grief by
refusing to associate with him. This means not to drink water or eat
in company with him and not to have any marriage connection with his
family. But to prevent people from rendering any services to such a
person is sheer heartlessness. Wells and ponds are for the use of
all. Services of barbers and washermen and public services like
transport should be available to all people, whether good or bad. The
barber, the washerman and the water-carrier do not concern themselves
with the circumstances of any family before serving it. Even a
murderer has a right to be allowed to drink water. In the measure
that we thus learn to distinguish between right and wrong, the advent
of swaraj will be hastened. I feel the necessity for resorting to
boycott or discourag- ing the consumption of liquor and that is why I
have gone into the subject at such length. Uncivil boycott has
yielded bitter fruits  at  many places. Our strength lies in giving
up incivility altogether. Once a man has become a drink-addict, he is
so utterly enslaved by the vice that he deserves our compassion, and
it is only through compassion that we shall be able to reform such
persons.</p>

But they said that, if they wore khadi dresses and khadi caps, they
would be dismissed. I was pained to hear these words of weakness. If
wearing a khadi cap is a crime, the right course is to commit that
crime and be dismissed from service. If, moreover, there is a large

When it was said here that 25 spinning-wheels are working and that
the khadi produced from them is sent to Bombay and Poona, I was
deeply pained. That the khadi is sent out only means that you want
fine cloth for yourselves and will not use khadi. That is why you
send khadi to other places. Swadeshi should mean, for you, that you
look after your needs. Give no thought to Bombay. My patriotism tells
me that I must first make my own home independent, then my town and
then my pro-vince. Let me tell you that, with your 25 spinning-
wheels, you will not be able to give a good account of yourselves in

practice; however, the lawyers becoming fear-less and religious-
minded will not make the whole country so. Besides, some eminent
lawyers have, in fact, made great sacrifices and displayed nobility.
Other layers, who lack faith and are deferred by the fear whether
they would afterwards be able to maintain their families, will also
give up practice by and by. But the position with regard to swadeshi
is that, so long as the whole country does not adopt it, the import
of foreign cloth will not stop. I cannot deceive myself. I meet a far
greater number of Indians than any other person does, but my voice
has not yet reached all the 30 crores. Mill-cloth is for the poor,
whom my message cannot reach. Only if it is reserved exclusively for
them will mill-owners behave worthily. For such people, of course,
there is no choice but to use mill-cloth unless they produce their
requirements locally. What this requires is not wealth,
self-sacrifice or intelligence. All that is necessary is zest.</p>

slavery when we parted with our spinning-wheels. If you want to throw

country and its stark poverty. I ask you, therefore, not  to  pat
yourselves on the back and say that with 25 spinning-wheels, you have
won the day. I fail to see anyone here wearing khadi. We cannot stop
imports worth 50 crores merely by wearing khadi caps. You must agree

If you want fine cloth, teach your wives, your sons and your
daughters to spin yarn of fine count. As recently as 30 years ago,
our elders felt ashamed to wear fine cloth. I have still fresh in my
mind the sacred memory of my mother. She made it a point to reserve
dresses of fine cloth for her daughters-in-law and felt embarrassed
when wearing such dresses herself. If you do not adopt the
traditional simplicity of India, you cannot resuscitate fine Muslins.
If you feel satisfied with having enrolled 4,200 members [of the
Congress], who will come forward to enrol the starving masses of
Bihar? There will be some hope of our succeeding in our task if , in

I observe that the <i>Indian </i><i>Social </i><i>Reformer </i>rates
me  for  not  having said anything about Maulana Mahomed Ali’s
speech at  Madras, and not having criticized Lala Lajpat Rai’s at
Bombay. I must not answer the inferencea and the innuendoes contained
in the paragraph . Critics do not know under what difficulties I edit
<i>Young </i><i>India. </i>I rarely read newspapers. I cannot even
get them during my incessant travelling. But having read this
criticism, I purposely procured at Simla a copy of the Maulana’s
speech. I have only just read it. I have twice read the paragraph
criticized, and I am of opinion that it contains nothing in it that
is objectionable. The speech is certainly not inconsistent with his
interview at Allahabad. In the Madras speech, he simply states the
Muslim position. In the Allahabad interview, he has accepted my
application and restriction of the ideal Muslim conduct. There is no
doubt that if the Mussulmans could take up arms, they would do so in
defence of Islam. The difficulty arises because of <i>our </i>belief
in the impossibility of the Afghans invading to defeat the British
without wishing at the same time to occupy India. That may be and
will be a good reason for Mussulmans, if they are true to India, not
joining the Afghans even if they were able. But we may not dispute
the theoretical religious right of Mussulmans to state their correct
position. We can only honour them for it. The two great qualities of
the brothers are their bravery and sincerity. And I can read nothing
but these two qualities in the Madras speech.</p>

Let me take the <i>Indian Social Reformer </i>into the secret of my
methods. My assistant drew my attention to the hostile criticism of
Lalaji's speech and asked me whether I wished to say anything upon
it. I had not the text of his speech before me, nor had I seen any
criticism. I therefore wrote to Lalaji, asking him to enlighten me on
the matter, and suggesting that he should apologize, if a single
hasty word was uttered. It has been my privilege on close
acquaintance to find him generous, for-giving and frank. He said in
his letter that his Bombay speech was a sp-ecially considered
utterance, and that he had not attacked any person in it. He had only
dealt with the action of the Moderates as a party. He sent me the
cutting for my opinion. This was whilst I was in Sind. I was unable

it, till the <i>Reformer's </i>rebuke reminded me of it. I have now
read Lalaji's speech and have much pleasure in stating that I find
nothing offensive or discourteous in it. It is undoubtedly in
Lalaji's fighting style. It is a party speech. He has adopted, by
long residence in the West, the Western form of criticism. But it is
the best Western form. There is nothing vulgar in it. His charges are
not unjustified by the conduct of the Moderate ministers. His worst
charges is that they have merged themselves in the bureaucracy. It is
a serious charge to make, but the instances adduced by him surely
prove it. The Moderates may retort, if they choose, that outsiders
cannot appreciate the difficulties of the ministers. But that is just
what proves the error of the great leaders who find themselves allied
with the Government. They should have known that such would be their
lot, or they should now know by experience, that it is no use being
ministers, until they have  an  effective control over the Government
policy. All the preression that is now going on is almost as bad as
before. It makes little difference that now there is the farce of a
trial. The fact is that most of the political sections of the Penal
Code are such as to bring almost every non-co- operation speech under
them. I believe that if I was charged, I should have to plead guilty
to the charge of sedition. It is the duty of a non- co-operator to
preach disaffection towards he existing order of things.
Non-co-operators are but giving disciplined expression to a nation's
outraged feelings. I should like to see a considered reply to Lala
Lajpat Rai's strong indictment. In my humble opinion, the speech of
Lala Lajpat Rai does not betray any loss of temper, and is quite in
keeping with the advice he tendered the youth of the country in his
concluding paragraphs.</p>

It gives me pleasure always to have criticism from Sind. It is always
searching and always courteous. Sind suffers from the surfeit of
Western education, and therefore, the youths of Sind readily com-
mand my sympathy. They are bewildered to find themselves in the maze
of Western ratiocination. I must herefore try patiently to answer Mr.
Jethamal’s open letter, especially as I claim him to be one of my
earliest comrades in satyagraha and know him to be  a  leader  of
forlorn causes. I do believe in self-determination. Mr. Jethamal does
not know that the Mussulmans do not claim Palestine for the Turks as
against the Arabs. They claim Mussulman control of Jazirat-ul-Arab of
which Palestine is but a part. They would not mind if it was restored
to the Arabs without any outside interference. Mr.  Jethamal  must

Mussulman. He should also know that the British mandate is today
being imposed upon Palestine and Mesopotamia in the teeth of fierce
Arab opposition.</p>

Unlike Mr. Jethamal, I do believe in the distinctive character of the
different scriptures. I cannot be party to putting a strain upon the
scriptural loyalty of the Mussulmans, where it is not in conflict
with reason and justice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
But I am one with Mr. Jethamal in his fear of theocratic priest- hood
and its interpretations often given to suit occasions. The Mussul-
man claim is not based on  <i>Futwahs</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>, but  on  a  Koranic  injunction which a child can
understand. The Mussulman claim is again based upon justice, even
apart from the scriptural authority. Jazirat-ul-Arab was under
Mussulman control before the War. No right has accrued to the
Christians or the Jews over it, as against the Mussulmans of the
world in general and of India in particular. The British mandate is
an act of treachery towards Indian Mussulmans and of pillage against
the world's Mussulmans.</p>

I must not appropriate the easy compliment Mr. Jethamal pays me of
attributing to me the courage of saying that I differ from Shri
Krishna in the matter of violence. I have the courage of saying that
Krishna never taught violence in the <i>Gita</i>. My interpretation
of the <i>Gita </i>is that it has based a religious teaching on a
historical incident,</p>

and that it does not deal with an earthly war but it deals with the
ceaseless spiritual war Going on in the human Kurukshetra. I can
understand the <i>Nirdwandwa </i>teaching on no other hypothesis. A
man who is free from the action of the pairs of opposites is
incapable, like the perfect man of the Bible, of injuring any living
thing on earth. He kills himself so truly that there is no rebirth
for him. But a non-co- operator is not concerned with this part of my
personal belief. He is bound to believe in non-violence as the only
true policy for the removal of the three-fold fever of India.</p>

with me by force of arms. I will not cut off the hands of my children
for fear of their hurting others. A man is innocent when he is able
to do harm and refrains. India’s soldiers must have arms so long as
they believe in violence. I invited, during the recruiting campaign
those who believed in violence to join the battle and not to keep
away, because they had a grievance against the Government, as they
were inclined to do. I was against bargaining with the Government as
I am against bargaining at any time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

Now it must not be difficult for Mr. Jethamal to appreciate my
alliance with the Ali Brothers. I believe them to be men of their
word, as honourable as any I have had the privilege of meeting. It is
enough for me to know that they observe the vow of non-violence,
whilst they are in the movement of non-co-operation. They will no
more prefer Afghan rule to British rule than Mr. Jethamal does. I
believe that time will enable them to see that India can never, not
at any rate within a generation, be free by violence. I believe that
India and Khilafat can be free during this very year if India
responds to the simple pro- gramme sketched in these pages from time
to time.</p>

this question has been asked because I appear to lead the life of a

The friend further inquires what a man who is falsely sued is to do.
Well, those who have been falsely charged by the Government have gone
to gaol. Those who are falsely sued may, if the plaintiff will not go
to private arbitration, make a statement and produce even witnesses
without engaging a lawyer. He is likely to have judgment in his
favour. But at the worst he runs the risk of having to pay a black-
guard. Surely wrong judgments have been given before now in spite of
the assistance of the ablest lawyers.</p>

The third question is, ‘‘Do you believe that the constructive
part of the non-co-operation programme can attain success without our
having a national Government?’’ This question betrays
helplessness. We are delayed in the attainment of our goal only
because of this feeling of help-lessness. We shall attain swaraj only
when we feel self- reliant. Even a national government will have to
be the nation’s creation; not the nation the Government’s. Why
should we not stop drink without the aid of the Government why should
we not be able to boycott foreign cloth without the Government aid ?
Non-co-operation enables us to show that, in everything that matters,
we can be indepen- dent of the Government. A Government is an agency
set up by the people. The principal has the right to non-co-operate
with the agent when he proves faithless. When, on the contrary, the
principal feels helpless, he becomes his agent’s slave. Such is our
present position and we must get rid of it at any cost.</p>

answer to the question undoubtedly is that, if the nation does not
make an adequate response to the programme, attainment of our goal is
likely to be delayed.</p>

Many are asking why I waited upon His Excellency the Viceroy. Some
inquire why the author of non-co-operation should seek to see the
Viceroy. All want to know the result of the interview. I like the
rigorous scrutiny of the non-co-operators who, more than Caesar’s
wife, must be above suspicion. Non-co-operation is self-reliance. We
want to establish swaraj, not obtain it from others. Then why
approach a Viceroy? This is all good, so far as it goes. And I should
be a bad representative of our cause if I went to anybody to ask for
swaraj. I have had the hardihood to say that swaraj could not be
granted even by God. We would have to earn it ourselves. Swaraj from
its very nature is not in the giving of anybody.</p>

But we want the world with us in our battle for freedom, we want the
goodwill of everybody. Our cause, we claim, is based upon pure
justice. There are certain things we want Englishmen to surrender.
All these things need mutual discussion and mutual understanding.
Non- co- operation is the most potent instrument for creating world
opinion in our favour. So long as we protested and co-operated, the
world did not; understand us. The erstwhile lion of Bengal in his
early days used to relate the story of Englishmen who asked him how
many broken heads there were in India, if things were really so bad 
as  he represented them to be. That was the way John Bull understood
best. The others question the world has undoubtedly been asking is :
If things are really so bad, why do we co-operate with the Government
is so pauperizing and humiliating us? Now the world understands our
attitude, no mater how weakly we may enforce it in practice. The
world is now curious to know what ails us. The Viceroy represents a
big world. His Excellency wanted to know why I, with whom co-
operation was an articles of faith, had non-co-operated. There must
be something wrong with the Government or me.</p>

And so His Excellency mentioned to Pandit Malaviyaji and to Mr.
Andrews that he would like to see me and hear my views. I went to see
Panditji because he was anxious to meet me. I hold him in such high
regards that I would not think, even if he was well and I could help
it, of letting him come to me. As it was, he was too weak to travel
to me. It was my duty to go to him. And when I heard the purport of</p>

his conversation with His Excellency, I did not require any

wished to hear my views. I have devoted so much space to the reason

It is directed not against men but against measures. It is not
directed against the Governors, but against the system they
administer. The roots of non-co-operation lie not in hatred but in
justice, if not in love. Gladstone<font size="1">1 </font>used to draw
a sharp distinction between bad actions and bad men. He was accused
of discourtesy for using some very strong expressions about the acts<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

 his  opponents.  He  put  up  the defence that he would have failed
in his duty if he had  not characterizes their actions as they
deserved to be, but he did not therefore mean to convey that his
opponents deserved the epithets he had used about their acts. As a
youth, when I heard this defen-ce, I could not appreciate it. Now
with years of experience and use, I understand how true it was. I
have found some of the truest of my friends capable of indefensible
acts. For me there are we truer men than V. S. Srinivasa Sastriar,
but his actions confound me. I do not think he loves me less because
he believes that I am leading India down to the abyss.</p>

And so I hope this great movement of non-co-operation has made it
clear to thousands, as it has to me, that whilst we, may attack
measures and systems, we may not, must not, attack men. Imperfect
ourselves , we must be tender towards others and be slow to impute
motives.</p>

I therefore gladly seized the opportunity of waiting upon His

The reader must not be too curious. He must not believe the so-
called ‘reports’ in the Press. The veil must remain drawn over
the details of the conversation between the Viceroy and myself . But
I may assure him that I explained, as fully as I knew how, the three
claims—the Khilafat, the Punjab, and swaraj , and gave him the
genesis of non-co-operation. His Excellency heard me patiently,
courteously</p>

thing. We had a full discussion of the burning topics as between man

We must redouble our efforts to go through our programme. It is
clearly as follows: (1) removal of untouchability, (2) removal of the
drink curse, (3) ceaseless introduction of the spinning-wheel, and
the ceaseless production of khaddar, leading to an almost complete
boy- cott of foreign cloth, (4) registration of Congress members, and
(5) collection of Tilak Swaraj Fund.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
No fierce propaganda is necessary for solidifying Hindu-  Muslim
unity and producing a still more non-violent atmosphere.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I have put untouchability in the forefront because I observe a
certain remissness about it. Hindu non-co-operators may not be
indifferent about it. We may be able to right the Khilafat wrong but
we can never reach swaraj, with the poison of untouchability corro-
ding the Hindu part of the national body. Swaraj is a meaningless
term if we desire to keep a fifth of India under perpetual
subjection, and deliberately deny to them the fruits of national
culture. We are seeking the aid of God in this great purification
movement, but we deny to the most deserving among His creatures the
rights of huma- nity. In human ourselves, we may not plead before the
Throne for deliverance from the inhumanity of others.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I put drink second, as I feel that God has sent the movement to us
unsought. The greatest storm ragte round it. The drink movement is
fraught with the greatest danger of violence. But so long as this
Government persists in keeping the drink shops open, so long must we
persist in sleeplessly warning our erring countrymen against
polluting their lips with drink.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The third place is assigned to the spinning-wheel, though for me it
is equally important with the first two. If we produce an effective</p>

Membership of the Congress is essential for the immense orga-

and for the manufacture and distribution of khaddar, and for
dispelling the fear that membership of the Congress may be regarded
as a crime by the Government.</p>

The punjabis living on the Frontier<font size="1">1 </font>deserve the
sympathy of the whole of India. They are exposed to attacks from the
neighboring tribes, they are defenceless, and from all the accounts
received by me, the Government seem to give them little or no
protection, and now-a- days the rule for the officers, if anyone
complains, is to refer the complaint to the Ali Brothers and to me.
If we had charge of the Frontier, I know what we would have done. We
would certainly have died in the attempt to defend the unarmed
population of the districts. We would have, if necessary, armed the
population for self-defence. But what is more, we would have won over
the tribesmen and turned them from marauding bands into trustworthy
neighbours. But we have to take things as they are. I assume that the
Hindus and the Mussul- mans are friendly to one another, and that no
Mussulman traitorously helps the tribesmen against his Hindu brother.
The Mussulman popu- lation this side of the Frontier is in an
exceptionally strong position to help.</p>

We must not despair of the tribesmen. We have too often considered
them to be hopeless. In my opinion, they are amenable to reason. They
are godfearing. They do not loot merely for pleasure. I believe that
they are themselves coming under the influence of the</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I know that the process of reforming the tribesmen is slow and
tedious. It provides poor comfort to those that are robbed of their
possessions or their dear ones.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The difficulty is to be traced to the same cause—we fear
Englishmen, and we have becomes slaves. We fear the tribesmen and we
are satisfied with our slavery, we are thankful that we are protected
by the former against the latter. I cannot imagine  a  greater
humiliation for a self-respecting man [than] to be dependent, for the
safety of himself or his family, on those who he thinks prey upon
him. I would prefer total destruction of myself and my all to purcha-
sing safety at the cost of my manhood. This feeling of helplessness
in us has really arisen from our deliberate dismissal of God from our
common affairs. We have become atheists for all practical purposes.
And therefore, we believe that in the long run we must rely upon
physical form physical danger, we cast all our philosophy  to  the
winds. Our daily life is a negation of God. If then we would but have
a little trust in God, i.e., ourselves, we shall find no difficulty
with the tribesmen. Only in that case, we will have to be prepared at
times to surrender our possessions and, under certain circumstances ,
our lives rather than our honour. We must refuse to believe that our
neighbours are savages incapable of responding to the finer instincts
in man.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
Thus, consistently with our self-respect, there are but two courses

however weakly against robbery and plunder, or to believe in the
capacity of our neighbours to respond to the nobler instinct in man
and to endeavour to reform the tribesmen. I apprehend that the who
pro- cesses will go hand in hand. We must avoid the third at any
cost, that is, reliance on the British bullet to protect us from
harm. It is the surest way to national suicide.</p>

If my writings can reach the tribesmen, I would certainly urge them
to leave their predatory habits. In as much as they loot a single man
or woman, they belie the teaching of the prophet whose name they
prize above all others and whom they believe to be the messenger of
the God of mercy and justice. It is the duty of every Mussulman and
Ulema who has any influence with these simple men to tell them that,
if they will play their part in defending Islam from impending
danger, the least they can do is to refrain from molesting their
neigh- bours, who have done not only no harm to them but who, whether</p>

purely for spreading disaffection. There is practically nothing in
the charge, which has not been repeated during the past twelve months
from a thousand platforms. Indeed, it may be stated to be the creed
of the non-co-operator to give voice to the popular disaffection
towards the Govern-ment and to spread it. Disaffection is the very
essence of non-co-operation. It is the belief of every
non-co-operator that the Government, meaning always the system, is
wicked, it is one of exploi- tation of India's resources, it has
brought on unrecedented paupersim and consequently famine and
disease. The system is responsible for India's helplessness. The
British ministers have undoubtedly broken their pledges to the
Mus-sulmans. This and much more every non-co- operator does believe,
and therefore seeks by non-co-operation to destroy the evil. I
congratulate Mr. Sundarlal on the prosecution. Indeed, I envy the
position occupied by him. Let the C.P. Government remove all the
other leaders of the move-ment, and yet they will find that, as a
result, he disaffection, which they would crush, is all the deeper
and intenser for their mad and thoughtless repression. The duty of
the people is clear. They must go on with their programme of
construction and thus prepare or the final triumph. We must keep sane
in spite of the Government’s madness.</p>

I publish the foregoing with pleasure. I have only removed rhe
embellishments. I am sorry if I have done an injustice to any school.
It is my duty to publish well-authenticated complaints about public
institu-tions. No amount of misrepresentation about them can damage
honest national enterprises. As for the Governor of Bombay, I gave my
own im-pression. I am still inclined to think that His Excellency
does not know the high-handed character of the doings of the Sind
officials. But even if the charges against the Government can be
established, I am unable to agree that we may resort to hartal every
time an unpopular official visits a place. I should feel sincerely
sorry if the Governor passed the remarks attributed to him. I have
believed the Governor of Bombay to be tactful and sober, and it would
be a rude shock to me to find that he had made the tactless and hasty
remarks reported of him.</p>

	been conscious of the short-comings and agitating for their rights.
	The Brahmins, however fallen they may be, are still in the forefront

I am convinced that the Brahmins are known for their self-sacrifice

compare it with the British bureaucracy. The latter follows "the
divide and rule policy" and maintains its authority by the power
 of the sword, whereas the Brahmins have never resorted to the force
of arms and they have established their superiority by sheer force of
their intellect, self-sacrifice and penance. None need be jealous of
their superiority. I appeal to my non-Brahmin brethren not to hate
the Brahmin and not to be victims of the snares of the bureaucracy.</p>

The non-Brahmins are wealthy. Agriculture is in their hands; so also
commerce. If they hanker after the public services, the way is made
quite open to them by the non-co-operation movement. Non-

You say the advice to boycott schools and colleges may be acceptable
to the Brahmins who are educated but will be decidedly harmful to the
non-Brahmins who are still uneducated. You also say that I am a fine
product of the modern education. But I must tell you that the modern
education has made cowards of us all. Our helplessness and mutual
jealousies are due to this education. It has developed a slave
mentality in us. The qualities which you attribute to me are not
certainly the result of this education. I have long ago freed myself
from the hypnotic influence of the education. I am what I am, by the
study of my religious and eternal principles of life and such
religious and philosophical books as the <i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita,

The 30th of June is fast approaching. In Gujarat, we have not reached
even the figure of two lakhs for the Tilak Swaraj Fund. Even in this,
the contribution of the really wealthy class is very small indeed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Do not the wealthy people love doing their duty. And do they not wish
to see India able to stand up and face the world? Do they not wish to
make their contribution to filling the hungry stomachs of over three
crores of men in the country? Is not the good name of India dear to
them? Do they not like that India should throw off her slavery? Ary
they not in a position , if they so will, to take up Gujara's burden
in a day? Is it not possible for the mill-owners of Ahmedabad, by
themselves, to raise a contribution of Rs 10 lakhs in a day, if they
so decide? If they choose, they can do a lot. I hope they will make
their contribution to the movement which is progressing apace in the
country.</p>

“If we help, the government will make things difficult for us.” 
I wish that the wealthy classes would shed this fear from their
hearts. The days for such fear are gone. And, again, if only one rich
man had to give, he could be intimidated; when, however, all agree to
give, how can any of them be intimidated?</p>

However, fear is such a thing that, despite one's desire to give, one
cannot take courage to be the first to do so. Shedding fears of this
nature should also be one of the important results of this big fight.
It is my hope that the wealthy classes will be brave and take their
full share in the work of national regeneration.</p>

Even if, however, some among the wealthy classes find it diffi- cult
to follow the dharma of fearlessness, I hope that they will not give
up the dharma of compassion. They will certainly extend what- ever
help is possible to the famine-stricken. At the time of the viru-
lent outbreak of the plague an d when there was a famine some time
ago, the wealthy classes were not found wanting. If they do or can do
nothing else, I pray that they will, at any rate, take up the burden
of famine relief.</p>

Gujarat has not only to meet its share of the demand made at Bezwada,
but also to go to the help of the weaker Provinces, and it is for

Gujarat, however, has a third burden to bear. There is drought  in
some parts of it and help is needed there too. I wish to draw the
attention of Gujaratis living outside Gujarat to all these three
matters. Wherever they are settled, they must do their duty by those
regions— about this there can be no argument. But they owe a like
duty to Gujarat. If Gujarat is to contribute 10 lakhs, it can do so
only if all Gujaratis living elsewhere too keep Gujarat in mind. If
they do, Gujarat can contribute not only the full amount of 10 lakhs
but even more.</p>

I wish to lay greater stress on the drought in Gujarat. At the time
of the Orissa famine, Gujaratis had made an excellent conri- bution.
It will not be wrong, in fact, if we say that it was Gujarat which
met the needs of famine relief then. If so, will Gujarat be doing
anything special if it meets such needs nearer home?</p>

My appeal is also addressed to those who do not approve of the
prevailing wind in other matters. They can contribute to the famine-
relief fund in two ways: by contribution to the Tilak Swaraj Fund 
or,  if they object to doing this, by remitting contributions
exclusively for the Relief Fund. In fact they can adopt any one of
three different modes of contribution: (1) The money may be offered
uncon- ditionally—all such amounts will be credited to the Tilak
Swaraj Fund;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; line-height: 102%">
(2) it may be offered to the Tilak Swaraj Fund, but earmarked for
famine relief—such amounts will be included in the Tilak  Swaraj

A visit to the province in which Lokamanya Tilak Maharaj was born,
the province which has produced heroes in the modern age, which gave
Shivaji and in which Ramdas and Tukaram flourished, is for me nothing
less than a pilgrimage. I have always believed that Maharashtra, if
it wills, can do anything. Its scepticism, however, is every a cause
of grief to me. I always feel that he province in which the best work
can be done has done the least. I gather that the workers in
Maharashtra hold the same view. After leaving simla, I went to Kalka
and then to Ambala. From there I proceeded to Khandwa in the Central
Provinces and thence to Bhusaval, Sangamner and Yeola. I am writing
these notes on my way to Kurduwadi. For going there, one has to go
from Yeola to Dhond and change trains there. As our train arrived
late at Dhond and the connecting train had already left, I got some
experience of Dhond as well. I felt that the masses everywhere had
the same faith but there were not enough workers. people lack
capacity for organization, there is no end to noise and bustle and
they get crowds of people to fill station platforms. As for the
result, however, I found it poor in Bhusaval, Sangamner and Yeola at
any rate, though he people who had invited me to these places were
capable workers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Where have we now the time for all this fuss and shouts of victory
and bending to touch my feet in reverence? If we can spare time to go
to station platforms, why not spend it in plying the spinning-wheet?
Why not use it in collecting contributions to the National Fund? Do
we not have to enrol a large number of Congress members? The position
now is that we shall be able to complete the programme before the end
of June, as decided, only if we work round the clock. Though two
months have elapsed, we have not done even</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
two-thirds of the work, not even one-half.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
If we fail to complete the programme of work by the end of June, it
will only show that our will and capacity to win swaraj are not
great.</p>

The collections at Bhusaval and Sangamner could be taken as on the
whole satisfactory, but at Yeola, I must say, the collections came
almost to nothing. Yeola is a rich town. It has Gujarati business men
settled there for the last 200 years and yet the amount collected
there for the Tilak Swaraj Fund was the smallest. It is true, of
course, that one person alone in Yeola gave Rs. 20,000 for a national
school. But, then negotiations for the donation had been going on for
a long time. The donor, besides, is well known for his charitable
disposition. For the Tilak Fund, however, contributions were to be
collected from the general public. The total collections from all,
men and women, must have come hardly to Rs. 300, while a small
village near Yeola, which we passed on the way, gave the same amount.</p>

At Yeola I was in a serious dilemma. I was called there specially  to
receive the Rs. 20,000 mentioned above and to open the national
school. We arrived at Yeola at 10 p.m. A public meeting was held at
the dead of night, at 1 a.m. I was tired beyond words. After a whole
day’s journey by car, I had to keep awake. At the meeting, I talked
of the national school. While there, I heard that they were going to
teach English in the school even this year. To be sure, I was not
happy to have to inaugurate such a school but, after expressing my
views about teaching English, I said a few words about the starting
of the school. I swallowed this one bitter draught. The following day
was my sacred day of silence, but I had agreed, all the same, to go
and open the school with out speaking. And now I learnt that
untouchables were not to be admitted to the school. I have
inaugurated many schools but I had not, during this year at any rate,
inaugurated a single one like this. I had to send word to the
managers of the school that I could not go to inaugurate a school of
this type, and the result was that I did not.   I was faced, in
Karachi, with a similar difficulty about inaugurating a swadeshi
store. It was stocked with all manner of goods and so I had to refuse
to inaugurate it in the same way that I refused to inaugu- rate the
school. I should not be asked to associate myself with any activities
which obstruct the non-co-operation programme or anything else on
which I hold strong views.</p>

If women wanted foreign clothes, ornaments, French and Japanese
silks, Manchester calicoes, how could they get swaraj? Could they not
give up those things for the sake of their country and wear plain
khaddar? Many of their countrymen went without proper clothing, and
he wanted every one of them to be clothed decently. People,
therefore, must consider that Khaddar was the best and holiest of
cloth. They had to start a spinning-mill in each household, and how
was it possible to do this, except by introducing the charkha? He did
not want big mills to grind down their men and women. Indians must
consider it a sin to wear foreign clothes and that it was a most
improper things to do. Until they considered that khaddar was a holy
cloth they would never attain swaraj. As long as they could not
produce finer qualities of cloth, they had to be content with the
khaddar. There was nothing better, nothing pure and nothing more
beautiful than khadar made of yarn spun by thier sisters and
brothers. They had to do all these things to right their khilafat
wrongs and the worngs of Punjab.</font></font></p>

I wish to see how much you do. First of all, be fearless. If we are
not ready to sacrifice one crore of rupees in memory of Tilak Maharaj
if we do not have enough honest men to collect this sum, how can we

daughters’ marriages. Now you are called upon to put a crown on
India. This is, indeed, an occasion when none other than the country
is being married. Eighty lakhs still remain to be collected.  Women
should give away all ornaments except those symbolic of their married

Self-sufficiency in food and clothing—this is what swaraj means.
Our mills do not produce enough cloth. Mill-cloth should be available
to those who go without clothes at present. The real meaning of
swaraj is that every poor person in the counry must have food and
clothing, and for this we must understand the nobiliyt of khadi,
inroduce the sinning-wheel into every home and tell ourselves that it
is sacrilege to wear naything except khadi. When khadi spreads
everywhere, the religon of truth will be established in the country.
Even if the cloth woven from the yarn spun by our sisters is too
heavy, we should be happy wearing it. If you follow the advice I have
given, swaraj is not far off.</p>

love a pure and virtuous life. In conclusion, I shall only say: you,

Mr. Bipin Chandra Pal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

to Mr. Pal that we cannot establish swaraj in India, till we rid
ourselves of the feeling of helplessness Swaraj means our prepared-
ness to deal with the Afghan and every other menace in our country.
The whole scheme of non-co-operation is based on trusting other
people, and if they prove untrustworthy, on our being prepared to
meet their deceit by self-suffering. I remind Mr. Pal of what he

Pan-Islamism, which Mr. Pal fears, is an admirable doctrine in so far
as a Mussulman wishes the solidarity of all Muslim states. It would
be a dangerous doctrine. If it were to mean a combination of Islamic
powers for the purpose of exploiting the world or converting it to
Islam by force. No sane Mussulman of my acquaintance has ever
entertained the latter idea. The world is growing sick of the domi-
nation of brute force.</p>

I assure Mr. Pal that I do not believe in flirtation with any senti-
ment. I reject those that are bad, and hug those that are good. I do
not believe that serious Mussulmans will welcome Afghan rule any more
than serious Hindus would. In writing my article on “The Afghan
Bogey”, I was minded only to defend the correct position of a com-
rade, and to warn India against being frightened by the interested
cry.</p>

I totally dissent from Mr. Pal's view that the event of an Afghan
invasion, or even the mere circulation of a rumour of such invasion
will incite a very large part of our Muslim population to
lawlessness, if not to open “revolt”. On the contrary it is my
firm belief that the Mussulmans hav too much at stake today—the
honour of their religion—to do any such foolish act. As Maulana
Shaukat Ali has said so often, the Mussulmans are too shrewd to mix
up violence wih non- violence. Mr. Pal has done a grave injustice to
the Hindus by attribu- ting to a “very large proportion” of
Hindus “a desire to settle their own account with the Mohammedans”.
He has, I venture to assure him, entirely misread the Hindu mind. The
Hindus are as much in earnest about the cow, as the Mussulmans about
the Khilafat. And the former know that they cannot save the cow—the
cherished dream of every Hindu—without the goodwill of the latter.
I promise that the Hindus will forget every wrong done in the past by
every Mussulman when the latter helps them to save the cow as I know
every Mussulman will feel eternally grateful to the Hindus if he
finds that he has retrieved the honour of Islam by thier voluntary
aid.</p>

Mr. Pal suggest that if the Amir invades and if we do not aid the
Government, there can only be a revolution. I venture to suggest
another alternative. If India, as a non-co-operating, India does not
assist, the Government will make terms with the people. I do not
consider the British people to be so utterly devoid of common sense
or resourcefulness as to leave India, rather than come to terms with
her and heal the Khilafat and the Punjab wounds. That India does not
yet possess the power to command attention I know only too well. I

Elsewhere the reader will see  my  humble  endeavor  in  reply<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>to Dr.Tagore’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>criticism of non-co-operation. I have since read his
letter to the Manager of Shantiniketan. I am sorry to observe that
the latter is written in anger and in ignorance of facts. The Poet
was naturally incensed to find that certain students in London would
not give a hearing to Mr. Pearson,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
  </font></sup>one of the truest of Englishmen, and he became equally
incensed to learn that I had told our women to stop English studies.
The reasons for my advice the Poet evidently inferred for himself.</p>

If he, with a poet's imagination, had seen that I was incapable of
wishing to cramp the mind of the Indian woman, and I could not object
to English learning as such, and recalled the  fact  that throughout
my life I had fought for the fullest liberty for women, he would have
been saved the injustice which he has done me, and which, I know, he
would never knowingly do to an avowed enemy. The Poet does not know
perhaps that English is today studied because of its commercial and
so-called political value. Our boys think, and rightly in the present
circumstances, that without English they cannot get Government
service. Girls are taught English as a passport  to  marriage. I know
several instances of women wanting to learn English so that they may
be able to talk to Englishmen in English. I know husbands who are
sorry that their wives cannot talk to them and their friends in
English. I know families in which English is being <i>made </i>the
mother tongue. Hundreds of youths believe that without a knowledge of
English, freedom for India is practically impossible . The canker has
so eaten into the society that, in many cases, the only meaning of
education is a knowledge of English. All these are for me signs of
our slavery and degradation. It is unbearable to me that the
vernaculars should be crushed and starved as they have been. I cannot
tolerate the idea of parents writing to their children, or husbands
writing to their wives, not in their own vernaculars but in English.
I hope I am as great a believer in free air as the great Poet. I do

The brief statement made by the Ali Brothers about some of their
speeches will, I know, give rise to adverse criticism in whispers if
not in public. It is best therefore to understand the apology. I am
unable just now to go into the whole of the genesis, but I can safely
inform the public that, as soon as some friends brought passages in
some of their speeches to my notice, I felt that they sounded harsh
and seemed to be capable of being interpreted to mean incitement to
violence. The air was thick with rumours of their arrest. No non-co-
operator con afford to go to prison on a false issue, certainly not
on a denial of his faith, i.c., non-violence. I felt at once that I
should draw their attention to the passages, and advise them to make
a statement clearly defining their position. In the heat of the
moment once is likely to use language which may bear a meaning never
intended. When one disregards the fear of the law and fears only
one's own conscience, one has to be doubly careful. But all the care
in the world would sometimes fail to prevent a slip. The Ali Brothers
carry a big burden on their shoulders. The prestige of Islam, in so
far as they are responsible for it, will be measured by the credit
they acquire for the most scrupulous regard for truth and honesty in
their dealings, and humility and courage of the highest order in
their bearing. My ‘alliance’ with them, as our friendship has
been called, is based upon</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
my belief in their strict honesty, frankness, fearlessness, courage
and humility. I know that they are among much maligned men in India.
All kinds of motives are attributed to them. They are said to  be 
making me their easy tool. Time, I am sure, will disprove all these
charges. But it was necessary that no hasty expression of theirs was
used against them to damage their character or good faith. Nothing
can be more hurtful to an honourable man than that he should be
accused of bad faith. It was in order to safeguard them, in so far as
it lay in their power, against any such imputation, that I advised
them to make the statement now published. In my opinion, by making it
they have raised the tone and prestige of the Khilafat struggle they
are leading. They have set an example to other workers. We are not to
seek imprisonment out of bravado. The gaol is the gateway to liberty
and honour, when innocence finds itself in it. The statement is a
warning to all of us, that we who are fighting the battle for freedom
and truth, must be most exact in our language. It would not be a bad
thing to read our speeches or not to make any at all. One of the
noblest of Mussulmans has imposed this restraint on himself. Maulana
Abdul Bari<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>is highly sensitive, and can be betrayed into using
under excitement language which he would not use in cooler moments,
and which he often does not mean. At the suggestion of friends he has
therefore undertaken as a rule not to speak in public at all. I cite
this great example for all of us to follow. The Ali Brothers, by
their frank statement, have given the guidance. We must not speak,
but if we must weigh our words well, lest we say thoughtlessly what
we do not mean, and thereby hurt the cause we represent.</p>

The poet of Asia, as Lord Hardinge called Dr.Tagore, is fast
becoming, if he has not already become, the Poet of the world.
Increasing prestige has brought to him increasing responsibility. His
greatest service to India must be his poetic interpretation of
India’s message to the world. The Poet is therefore sincerely
anxious that India should deliver no false or feeble message in her
name. He is naturally jealous of his country’s reputation. He says
he has striven hard to find himself in tune with the present
movement. He confesses that he is baffled. He can find nothing for
his lyre in the din and the bustle of non-co-operation. In three
forceful letters<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>he  has   endea- voured to give expression to his
misgivings, and he has come to the conclusion that non-co-operation
is not dignified enough  for  the India of his vision, that it is a
doctrine of negation and despair. He fears that it is a doctrine of
separation, exclusiveness, narrowness and negation.</p>

In all humility I shall endeavour to answer the Poet’s doubts. I
may fail to convince him or the reader who may have been touched by
his eloquence, but I would like to assure him and India that non-
co-operation in conception is not any of the things he fears, and he
need have no cause to be ashamed of his country for having adopted
non-co-operation. If in actual application, it appears in the end to
have failed, it will be no more the fault of the doctrine than it
would be of Truth if those who claim to apply it in practice do not
appear to succeed. Non-co-operation may have come in advance of its
time. India and the world must then wait, but there is no choice for
India save between violence and non-co-operation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Nor need the poet fear that non-co-operation is intended to erect a
Chinese Wall between India and the West. On the contrary,
non-co-operation is intended to pave the way to real, honourable and
voluntary co-operation based on mutual respect and trust. The present
struggle is being waged against compulsory co-operaion, against one-
sided combination, against the armed imposition of modern methods of
exploitation masquerading under the name of civilization.</p>

The Poet’s concern is largely about the students. He is  of opinion
that they should not have been called upon to give up Government
schools before they had others schools to go to. Here I must differ
from him. I have never been able to make a fetish of literary
training. My experience has proved to my satisfaction that literary
training by itself adds not an inch to one's moral height and that
character-building is independent of literary training. I am firmly
of opinion that the government schools have unmanned us, rendered us
helpless and godless. They have filled us with discontent, and,
providing no remedy for the discontent, have made us despondent. They
have made us what we were intended to become—clerks and
interpreters. A government builds its prestige upon the apparently
voluntary association of the governed. And if it was wrong to co-
operate with the Government in keeping us slaves, we were bound to
begin with those institutions in which our association appeared to be
most voluntary. The Youth of a nation are its hope. I hold that as
soon as we discovered that the system of government was wholly, or
mainly, evil, it become sinful for us to associate our children with
it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
It is no argument against the soundness of the proposition laid down
by me, that the vast majority of the students went back after the
first flush of enthusiasm. Their recantation is proof rather of  the 
extent of our degradation than of the wrongness of the step.
Experience has shown that the establishment of national schools has
not resulted in drawing many more students. The strongest and the
truest of them came out without any national schools to fall back
upon, and I am convinced that these first withdrawals are rendering
service of the highest order.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
But the Poet’s protest against the calling out of the boys is
really a corollary to his objection to the very doctrine of
non-co-operation. He has a horror of everything negative. His whole
soul seems to rebel against the negative commandments of religion. I
must give his objec- tion in his own inimitable langugae. “R. in
support of the present movement has often said to me that passion for

acceptance of an ideal. Though I  know it to be a   fact   I  can

positive and <i>Nirvana </i>to the negative side of truth. Therefore
he emphasized the fact of <i>dukha</i>, misery which had to be
avoided and the <i>Brahmavidya </i>emphasized the fact of <i>ananda</i>,
joy which had to be attained.” In these and kindred passages the
reader will find the key to the Poet's mentality. In my humble
opinion rejection is as much an ideal as the acceptance of a thing.
It is an necessary to reject untruth as it is to accept truth. All
religions teach that two opposite forces act upon us and that the
human endeavour consists in a series of eternal rejections and
acceptances. Non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as
cooperation with good. I venture to suggest that the poet has done an
unconscious injustice to Buddhism in describing <i>Nirvana </i>as
merely a negative state. I make bold to say that <i>mukti</i>,
emancipation, is as much a negative state as <i>Nirvana </i>.
Emancipation from or extinction of the bondage of the flesh leads to
<i>ananda </i>(eternal bliss). Let me close this part of my argument
by drawing attention to the fact that the final word of the
<i>Upanishads </i>(<i>Brahmavidya</i>) in <i>Not</i>. <i>Neti </i>was
the best description the authors of the <i>Upanishads </i>were able
to find for <i>Brahman</i>.</p>

I therefore think that the Poet has been unnecessarily alarmed at the
negative aspect of non-co-operation. We had lost the power of saying
‘no’. It had  become  disloyal,  almost  sacrilegious,  to  says
‘no’ to the government. This deliberate refusal to co-operate is
like the necessary weeding process that  a  cultivator  has  to 
resort  to before he sows.  Weeding  is  an  necessary  to 
agriculture  as  sow-  ing Indeed, even whilst the crops are growing,
the weeding fork, as every husbandman knows, is an instrument, almost
of daily use. The nation's non-co-operation is an invitation to the
Government to co- operate with it on its own terms as is every
nation's right and every good government’s duty. Non-co-operation
is the nation's notice that it is no longer satisfied to be in
tutelage. The nation has taken to the harmless(for it),natural and
religious doctrine of non-co-operation in the place of the unnatural
and irreligious doctrine of violence. And if India is ever to attain
the swaraj of the poet’s dream, she will do so only by non-violent
non-co-operation. Let him deliver his message of peace to the world,
and feel confident that India through her non-co- operation, if she
remain true to her pledge, will have exemplified his message.
Non-co-operation is intended to give the very meaning to partiotism
that the Poet is yearning after. An India prostrate at the feet</p>

securing Hindu-Muslim unity, I compromised the Principle of non-

the Mussulman claim was just from every point of view that I plunged
myself into it. For me it was a chance of a life time. I felt that if
I could but show my loyalty to my Mussulman countrymen in the hour of

But argues Mr.Zacharias, the Khilafat is based on force. The Khilafat
is the earthly representative of Islam pledged o defend it even with
the sword. And how can I, a believer in non-violence, fight to

Mr.Zacharias is right in his description of the Khilafat. He is wrong
in his estimate of the function of a votary of non-violence. A
beli-ever in non-violence is pledged not to resort to violence  or
physical force either directly or indirectly in defense of anything,
but he is not precluded from helping men or institutions that are
themselves not based on non-violence. If the reverse were the case I
would, for instance, be precluded from helping India to attain swaraj
because the future Parliament of India under swaraj, I know  for
certain, will be having some military and police forces, or to take a
domestic illustration, I may not help a son to secure justice,
because forsooth he is not a believer in non-violence.</p>

Mr. Zacharias's proposition will reduce all commerce by a believer in

do believe that complete non-violence means complete cessation of all
activity.</p>

Not such, however, is my doctrine of non-violence. My business is to
refrain from doing any violence myself, and to induce by persua- sion
and service as many of God’s creatures as I can to join me in the
belief and practice. But I would be undrue to my faith if I refused
to assist in a just cause any men or measures that did not entirely
coin- cide with the principle of non-violence. I would be promoting
vio- lence, if finding the Mussulmans to be in the right, I did not
assist them by means strictly non-violent against those who had
treache- rously plotted the destruction of the dignity of Islam. Even
when both parties believe in violence, there is often such a thing as
justice on one side or the other. A robbed man has justice on his
side, even though he  may  be<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

it would be accounted as a triumph of non-violence if the injured
party could be persuaded to regain his property by methods of
satyagraha, i.e., love or soul-force rather than a free fight.</p>

This is a straightforward, simple resolution which even a child can
understand. On our success in implementing it will depend  whether or
not the country is to have swaraj, the Khilafat issue is to be
settled and we are to get justice in regard to the Punjab. I request
my sisters and brothers of Gujarat to remember the last year. We
passed then the non-co-operation resolution before the Congress had
done so. Even before there was any question of justice for the Punjab
or of swaraj, we, Hindus and Muslims of Gujarat, had decided that we
would seek a solution of the Khilafat issue through soul-force. Even
if the country as a whole did not realize that a satisfactory
Khilafat settlement implied a solution of the questions relating to
the Punjab and the demand for swaraj, we had decided that we
Gujaratis would sacrifice our all to get the Khilafat problem
settled. I want you to call to mind the faith which Gujarat showed on
thos occasions.</p>

lakh spinning-wheels within the time fixed, it will come down on its
knees. Our success in doing this will be a measure of our strength.
When you have done this, the world will have realized, and so will
have the Government, that you have faith in yourselves, that you
really mean to have swaraj. It will not be necessary for us then to
ask the army to lay down arms and the people to withhold taxes. So
long as the country has not acquired such faith in itself, it will
find that the spinning wheel programme is in fact as difficult to
carry out as it seems easy. When we have fully implemented it, no one
in the country will go hungry and no woman will be obliged to sell
her honour for getting work. India will then be enjoying <i>dharmarajya,
Ramarajya </i><i>or </i><i>Khudarajya. </i>It will be a test of
Gujarat’s strength whether it succeeds in starting one lakh
spinning-wheels, enrolling three lakh members and collecting 10 lakh
rupees. The question has also been asked why Gujarat should be
burdened with the responsibility of raising so much when its share
should be three lakhs and no more. We have made Gujarat the
foundation on which this struggle is to rest, and who does not know
that the foundation carries the heaviest weight ? Hence it is that
its quota is fixed at a relatively high figure. If all of us have
faith in ourselves, collecting 10 lakhs is no difficult task. If we
in Gujarat do not show such  faith,  with  what  face  can  I 
approach  business men in Bombay? We should even lay down our lives
to fulfil the programme decided upon at Bezwada. To be sure, we had
better die if the task is not completed by June 30. This is the key
to swaraj. As soon as this Empire discovers that India has mastered
this key, it will either quit or remain here as a servant of the
people.</p>

Someone told Maulana Mahomed Ali at Calcutta that people described
the idea of winning swaraj with the help of the spinning programme as
attempting a miracle. The Maulana answered that perhaps it was so,
but, he asked, which was a greater miracle, this one or the fact that
a handful  of whites  coming  from  six  thousand  miles away ruled
over 33 crores ? To get swaraj, we shall need faith in ourselves and
shall have to become united. If we can have priests, like Gujaratis,
who give 10 lakhs for the right to worship in the great temple that
is India, which includes mosques  for  Muslims, <i>Gurudwaras </i>for
Sikhs and temples for Hindus and for Parsis, that would mean that we
are fit for swaraj. It will serve our purpose even if Gujarat comes
forward alone to fight unaided. If we cannot show this capacity for
organization, if we are not ready to make this sacrifice, we had
better give up talking about swaraj. There is nothing in this which</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
means embracing beggary. If you, Gujarati sisters, decided by
yourselves to see to this, you can tomorrow produce 10 lakh rupees
from Gujarat. Today , when India is a helpless widow, what right have
we to adorn ourselves with jewellery or fine dresses? When thou-sands
are dying of hunger, how can we deck our selves in gold and silver?
If all of you, ladies, keep only as many articles of jewellery as are
custo- mary for a married woman to wear and give away the rest, we
should have the sum of 10 lakhs in an hour. The day women in Gujarat
show this spirit, the very gods in heaven will come down and watch.
The women should learn this holy secret of swaraj, of <i>swadharma</i>,
that at the present time they can preserve heir dignity only by
putting away their adornments.</p>

We lack faith in ourselves; some put excessive faith in me. They
think Gandhi will manage somehow to raise one crore before June 30.
Let me tell you, however, that this is an entirely groundless belief.
Even if Gandhi had such strength, the swaraj won through his strength
would be Gandhi’s rule and not swaraj, and be sure Gandhi’s rule
will be no better than a monster's rule. What Gandhi desires is that
everyone should have gandhi's strength and Gandhi's faith in himself,
and be free from his defects and weaknesses. I do not desire my rule,
I want swaraj. I want  you to have the courage which we three<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

I have also known men who gently reasoned with their wives and got
from them their jewellery for the country. Think over this, you men,
all of you. Form a resolution that you will plead with your sisters

the home. We shall be able to achieve nothing so long as we spare our

When we have secured swaraj, you may wear diamonds and pearls and all
else by way of adornment. I shall not grudge you those things then.
At present I do. Though I have risen above uncharitable thoughts to a
great extent , I do get such thoughts when I see anyone in fine dress
or jewellery while the country is in its present degraded state. I
ask myself what the reason could be that these persons do not
understand. Take up this work forth with today. It will be more than
enough if you return from the holy banks of the Narmada with this
spirit in you. Come what may, do not stop working to advance the good
of both Hindus and Muslims, do not give up working for the protection
of dharma. If you spend on the building of this great temple, if on
this cause, far more sacred than a marriage, you spend as much as you
do on building other temples and on the marriage of a son or
daughter, collecting 10 lakhs will be no difficult task. If any poor
persons happen to have no money to pay, give four annas on their
behalf and get their names enrolled on the Congress register. Even
the spinning-wheel programme will be child's play if we enlist the
services of carpenters and blacksmiths for the cause. I venture to
assert that, even if women alone go out and work all the thirty days
of the month, collecting 10 lakhs will be mere fun for them. I am
weary of making speeches. I have not, however, lost my faith in the
women of Gujarat. They are so pure, have such faith, that they are
moved the moment they hear anyone talk about <i>dharmarajya</i>. My
faith in them has come from the way they rain jewellery on me.</p>

well-baked if our petition to ourselves is well addressed. Money,
spinning-wheel and members are tangible things, but non-violence is a
matter of the heart. It is not something which can be seen by the
eye. The country should understand that non-violence is essential for
this movement as breath is essential for life. We have no use for the
non- violence of the stone, of one who would not be disturbed even
when kicked; no use, either, for the non-violence of the brute, of
the dog, who, when someone strikes it, barks or runs to bite the
person. We need non-violence such as was displayed by Lachhman singh
and Dulip Singh. If I may use friend Shaukat Ali's words, it  is 
cold strength we require. So long as we have not acquired it, we
shall not be onsidered fit for swaraj. If we hope to win swaraj with
the strength of aeroplanes, we shall not succeed even in a hundred
years. The Malegaon incident has put back the clock of swaraj. Though
it is true that the incident will not cost us swaraj altogether, the
cause has certainly received a set-back. We have not made
non-violence on our part conditional on the Government remaining
non-violent. That  would be, really speaking, co-operation with the
Government. We want to offer non-violent non-co-operation. Our
non-violence will be true non-violence only if, even under a shower
of bullets or with bombs</p>

dropping on us from aeroplanes, we go on working peacefully and do
not rush to kill a Collector or burn post-offices. When we have
cultivated such non-violence, we shall not fear that this Government
will be succeeded by Pathans. So long as we have the strength of non-

Besides this lesson of non-violence, we should learn another, that of
Hindu-Muslim unity. If we go on fighting among ourselves, our
movement will soon be over. We want non-violence not of the weak but
of the strong, the non-violence which proceeds from courage. Such
non-violence can be practised by one as weak as I am or by one who
will be a match for five others like me.When I was a boy of ten or
twelve, I used to be frightened of ghosts. At that time, my female
attendant Rambha told me that I should repeat Rama’s name every
time I thought about a ghost. Accordingly, I used to recite the
<i>Ramaraksha </i>and clear the room of ghosts and spirits. The non-
violence India needs is that of the Arab boy who chose death rather
than surrender, it is such non-violence as Prahlad displayed. I have
been asking Muslims to keep reminding themselves of that Arab boy,
and  the  Hindus  of Prahlad,  and  cultivate  non-violence, 
fortitude and courage like theirs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The reference to Malegaon is included in  the  Resolution because we
are to forget it and remember, instead, Lachhman Singh’s and Dulip
Singh’s non-violence, their self-sacrifice. Your raising  hands
here in support of such non violence will mean that, from today, you
have shed fear of men and learnt to fear only God.So long as we have
not done this, the world will bully us as it has always done. It is
through Gujarat that we are to help India cultivate such strength.
Non-payment of taxes is to be made possible through Gujarat. We can,
however, succeed in this only when we have acquired the strength of
non-violence. May God give such strength to everyone.</p>

I congratulate non-<i>Antyaj </i>friends who are present here, as I
hold that the Hindus have been cleansed through them. There was no
need at all to present me an address. These days, when asked by
anyone, I say I am an <i>Antyaj</i>. The <i>Antyaj’s </i>is a holy
profession and we cannot dispense with his services. If no one
undertook to clean lavatories, we would simply die of cholera. Forget
the idea of presenting an address to me and think of doing some hard
work. Improve your conditions, give up liquor and stop killing
animals for hide. You may skin dead ones. After doing your work, take
a bath and clean yourselves before stirring out. Do not go begging
for left-overs. Do not accept such things from anyone. Politely
decline them. Accept only what  is  offered with respect.</p>

The calico from Ahmedabad is for the very poor. You should have
khadi, the stamp of culture. Make cloth yourselves, and wear or sell
that. Giving up liquor and engaging yourselves in weaving—these are
the means of your uplift.</p>

I have read H.E. the Viceroy’s speech. I think it is all right,
though it has the flavour of Simla. We do not mind that however. If
he wants his record to be judged by the yardstick of “act as you
speak”, he must act up to his word.</p>

Making after-dinner speeches is a bad practice in itself. After
dinner, a man relaxes himself. One is not in a condition immediately
to apply one’s mind seriously to anything then, especially after a
dinner given with such pomp and splendour that newspapers would carry
special accounts of it. This explains why Viceregal speeches are not
as studied as they should be.</p>

Let His Excellency, again,not make light of the Ali Brothers’
letter. It was not written for his sake, but for the sake of friends.
One need not take exception to his having pointed to the Ali
Brothers' speeches. It is a sign of nobility to admit a mistake
pointed out even by an enemy. Some of the speeches of the Ali
brothers contained remarks which were ambiguous. All that the Ali
Brothers’ letter means is that no one who is struggling to defend
his country and his religion should say anything ambiguous, knowingly
or unknowingly. To show their nobility, they have respected the
advice given by friends like me and have made a sincere and solemn
promise to exercise still further restraint on themselves when
speaking.</p>

The Viceroy needs experience yet. He has to study a movement which
has had no parallel. His speech suggests a preliminary study. He has
tried to be cautious in his speech. The attempt has not wholly
succeeded. He has tried to win over non-co-operators, but they cannot
be won over by speeches. They will not put a wrong construction on
speeches, but they will judge only from action.</p>

I should like to write at length about the Conference held in Broach.
But, at midnight, and when thoroughly exhausted, I shall write in
brief.</p>

By the end of this month, 10 lakhs of rupees are to be collected,
three lakh members enrolled and one lakh spinning-wheels put into
commission. This is both easy and difficult for Gujarat.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It appears difficult for lack of workers. If a large number of
workers—men and women—come forward, the task is easy. In these
three things, even those can help who are not full-fledged non-co-
operators, who do not have faith in non-co-operation. Only those who
regard non-co-operation as a sin cannot help. I am sure that the
number of such persons is fewer than the fingers of a hand.</p>

How can we have this amount? This will be possible: (1) if women
surrender their ornaments, (2) if the wealthy give a certain
percentage of their earnings, (3) if all people give a certain
portion of their earnings, (4) if those who drink give a part of what
they spend on liquor, and (5) if some wealthy persons give all they
have—there are many such ifs. We have to succeed in our task by
satisfying these ifs. If the pledge taken at the Broach Conference is
not fulfilled, Gujarat will be put to shame and it will be difficult
to secure swaraj before the end of this year. Those who cannot give
money should work on the spinning-wheel. Those who cannot do this
should enrol members. Everyone should do his duty.</p>

Anyone who fulfills these conditions can become a members of the
congress, even though he believes in co-operating [with the
Government], is a title-holder or a [practicing] lawyer or wears
foreign cloth. The Congress is not the organ of a single party and so
there should be the minimum of restrictions on becoming its members.
Only such conditions as are acceptable to all have been laid down.
This is, however, merely what the Congress rules mean.</p>

Personally, I certainly expect that, since non-co-operation has
become as widespread as we know it has, everyone will be a non-co-
operator. But it may be that my reading of the country's mood is not
correct or that the country is not ready to do what it believes in. I
certainly want everyone professing to be a non-co-operator to abide
by the necessary conditions. If, however, the members of the Congress
become non-co-operators in greater numbers, they may even be able to
change the views of the Congress at its next session. Day to day, the
struggle is becoming purer, the end and the means are becoming
clearer. According to the saying “ He is a hero who in a crisis
stands up undaunted” we are looking for heroes in the country. The 
Congress is one means of discovering them.</p>

It will be nothing short of a tragedy if we do not fulfil the Bezwada
programme before the end of the month. Seven days of the month will
have gone before these notes are out. We have not a moment to spare.
We have hardly collected twenty lakhs of rupees as yet. To collect
eighty lakhs during the next three weeks may seem an impossibility.
But the seeming impossibility can be easily turned into a possibility
if we were ceaselessly to work for the collection. Twenty- one
provinces, if they will respond according to their ability,  can
easily furnish the balance. The Bezwada programme is the most
concrete ever placed before the nation. If the people are with us and
if we have enough workers, one crore of rupees is a mere nothing for
thirty crores of people to find for a cause so great as that of
swaraj, and for perpetuating a memory so great as that of the
Lokamanya. If they choose, the women of India can give the money out
of their jewellery, the liquor drinkers can give it out of their
drinks. The mill- owners, who have derived the greatest benefit from
the swadeshi movement, can find the eighty lakhs in a day. The
Marwadis can, without any strain on their resources, find the amount,
and so could the <i>Bhatias</i>, the <i>Memons</i>, the Parsis or the
banias. They are all a prosperous community, and have before now more
or less supported public movements. If they wish, the Sindhis can
also find the amount. The labourers of India could pay the whole
amount, if they sacrificed one-twelfth of their yearly earnings. I
have consulted many friends as to the amount that can be easily paid
by the respective classes mentioned by me. The following may serve as
a working basis :</p>

Questions have been persistently asked as to why this large sum is
required. The answer is simple. It is a profitable investment, not
for purely personal but for public good. The amount will be devoted
chiefly to distributing spinning-wheels and conducting national
schools. We have, say, six crore homes, if broken down families may
deserve so sweet a name. We must provide thes families with spinning-
wheels, and enable them to become real homes. One crore of rupees is
surely the least amount required for establishing home-spinning on
such a basis as to become self propagating. Similarly, if we are to
reconstruct our educational system, we shall need more than one crore
of rupees for the purpose.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The second question that has been asked is—what security is there
for honest accountancy ? In the first place, we have in Messrs.
Chhotani<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1       </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and   Jamnalal   treasurers   of    unimpeachable   
integrity. Secondly, we have in Pandit Motilal Nehru a working
secretary of great ability, experience and equally unimpeachable
integrity. Thirdly, we have a vigilant working committee composed of
fifteen representative Indians, who meet at least once a month in
order to be able to exercise effective control over Congress affairs.
So much for the all-India finance. The All-India Congress Committee
is directly liable for the expenditure of one-fourth of the fund. The
remaining three fourths are to be retained by the Provincial
Committees for local needs. Each Province is expected to keep
efficient watch over its own finance. Finally, the whole income and
expenditure, both provincial and central, is subject to be audited by
auditors to be appointed by the All India Congress Committee.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
As with finance, so with the registration of members, and manu-
facture and introduction of spinning-wheels. These three are simple
and effective tests of our constructive capacity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I suggest to all Congress and Khilafat workers that they should set
apart the last ten days as special Congress days to be solely devoted
by them to finishing the Bezwada programme. No speeches are required,
no meetings are necessary. Quiet house to house visits and personal
canvassing are more effective than meetings for the class of work
before us.</p>

Gujarat has held its Provincial Conference and its Khilafat Con-
ference at the historic town of Broach. The Conferences met on the
banks of the beautiful Narmada. It had also a khaddar and charkha
exhibition. The great variety of charkha showed that India's
inventive genius was being profitably utilized. Let not the reader,
however, imagine that there was among these specimens a charkha with
more spindles, yielding a correspondingly larger outturn of yarn.
Addresses of the Chairman of the Reception Committee and the
President of the Conference were both brief and to the point. The
Chairman, Mr.Haribhai Amin, took no more than fifteen minutes to read
his simple address. The President, Mr.Vallabhbhai Patel, took no more
than thirty minutes to read the whole of his address. I commend the
latter to the reader for its simplicity, terseness, relevancy and
courtesy. It has not one bitter word for the opponents of
non-co-operation. Its criticism of the Government is most restrained.
The major part of it deals with the constructive part of
non-co-operation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
But the importance of the Conference lies in the resolution allo-
cating to Gujarat its portion of the Bezwada programme. It calls upon
Gujarat to furnish more than three times its quota of subscription to
the Tilak Swaraj Fund, i.e,. ten lakhs, its almost exact quota of
members, i.e., three lakhs, and one lakh of charkhas, i.e., a little
less than double its quota. I do not say it will be a proud record if
it is fulfilled. It will not be bad, if it is accomplished before the
30th June. The ten lakhs of rupees have been further allocated to the
respective districts so as to systematize the collection. The
Congress membership in Gujarat stands at 40,514. The Fund stands at
Rs.1,40,149 of which Rs.35,000 have been forwarded to the All-India
Congress Committee. The total number of spinning-wheels is 20,058.</p>

Gujarat is perhaps the strongest in the matter of nationalizing
education, as it is the weakest, perhaps, of all the provinces in the
suspension of practice by lawyers—not more than half a dozen having
suspended practice. Its progress in national education I must give in
the words of the report before me.</p>

I have just seen a copy of the report of non-co-operation work in the
Punjab, as submitted to the General Secretary,  All-India Congress
Committee, from which I extract the following interesting figures. To
the times of writing the report, i.e., the end of April, the total
collections stood at Rs.2,09,081-As. 13. I have already remarked on
the business like character of this collection. The Punjab deserves
congratulations for heading the list among all the Provinces. I am
not aware that even to-day, any single province can boast of having
collected over two lakhs. But on the principle that more is always
expected of those who give much, I hope that during this last month
of privilege, the Punjab will make still greater effort, and if
possible, even beat her own record and retain the first place. I say
if possible, because, although Bombay has been practically asleep all
this time, I cannot conceive the possibility of any province beating
Bombay. But  I know that the Punjab has the capacity, and if she adds
to it the will, she can certainly come up a close second, if she is
not easily the first. Next to Pandit Malaviyaji, I know no one who is
so  efficient  in begging as Lalaji. The Arya Samaj activity has used
the middle class to contributing to political movements. The
merchants of Amritsar can alone find the balance needed. There is
certainly every reason for Amritsar to find the balance. But
Jullundhar, Lyallpur, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujranwala, Sialkot,
Hafizabad are all places that can afford to pay handsomely. Lahore
itself has many wealthy merchants, and, but for the unfortunate fact
that we have no faith in ourselves, the Punjab can certainly share
with Bombay the honour of making up the deficiency. At any rate let
us hope that she will.</p>

The Punjab's records in point of education is also not bad, though,
seeing what  the  college  students  and  the  schoolboys  had  to go
through in  the  Martial  Law  days,  her  record  might  have  been
better. Over 350 students are  reported  to  have  left  their
colleges permanently. Of these, 85, being among the most brilliant
students, have joined the Indian  national  service.  A  board  of
national education has been established. The Guru Nanak Khalsa
College,  Gujranwala,  has  disaffiliated  itself  from  the  
university. The Provincial Committee has opened a national college at
Lahore. Eight old schools, some of them of high standing, have become
nationalized, and fifteen new national schools have been started. I

Mr.Santanam, the secretary , had furnished the exact number of pupils
studying in these national institutions. From what I know of some of
these schools myself, the figure is not likely to be under five
thousand. Nearly 25 teachers have left Government institutions.
Forty- one lawyers have suspended practice, of whom only  thirteen 
are getting subsistence allowance from the Provincial Committee.
Pancha- yats have been established in nearly 80 places. The Punjab
had, at the end of April, 258 Congress Committees. The average
member-ship is about 75. The Rohtak District comes easily first with
47 Committees.</p>

No part of India can beat the Punjab for spinning-wheels. The report
states with pride that there are very few Punjabi homes in which
there is not a charkha. “Till recently, they have remained idle,
but during the last two months everyone has come back to the habit of
spinning.” The sad fact, in spite of almost universal hand-spinning
in the Punjab, remains that the Punjabis had taken to the tawdry,
starchy calico, so uncomfortable in the Indian weather for personal
wear, in the place of the beautiful, soft, durable and absorbent
khaddar. I read with pleasure, therefore, that <font size="2">“</font>the
habit of wearing khaddar clothes amongst the well-to-do classes is
growing daily”. The Punjab is experiencing difficulty in finding
the number of weavers required. Most people do not know that the
weavers yielding to the temptations offered by unscrupulous
recruiting agents, exchange the honourable calling of weaving for
that of murdering. The Punjab, at one time, had probably the largest
number of weavers in proportion to her population in all India. I
hope, now that weaving is daily becoming more and more honourable and
paying, the Punjabis will prefer it to the, at the present moment at
any rate, dishonourable calling of so- called soldiering.</p>

I have purposely refrained from dealing with this  trouble,  though I
have remained  in  touch  with  Mr.  Andrews  and  others, who are on
the spot dealing with it. I refer to the trouble only to state that I
knew nothing of its coming. I should be sorry if anybody used my name
 to  lead  the  men  to  desert  their  employers.  It  is clear
enough that it is purely a labour trouble. It  is  admitted  that 
the employers reduced the wages. Both Mr. Das and Mr. Andrews report
that the trouble is purely economic, and that the coolies have a
substantial grievance. It is evident that the reformed Government has
failed to cope with it. I observe that <i>The </i><i>Times </i><i>of
</i><i>India </i>has made</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the most illegitimate use of the trouble to impute enmity to English
com-mercial interests in India. It has become the fashion to
attribute hatred to non-co-operators. I make bold to say that
non-co-operation has alone prevented racial feuds and disturbances,
and directed the anger of the people in the proper channel. The aim
of non-co- operation is to hurt no interest whatsoever by reason only
of its belonging to a race. Its aim is to purge every interest of its
injurious or impure character. Every English or Indian interest that
is based on injustice or brute force, or is antagonistic to the
growth of India as a whole, is undoubtedly in peril. No interest that
is supported merely by brute force but not by people’s goodwill can
possibly survive the fire of non-co-operation. If the Assam planters
are not sustained by the exploitation of Indian labour, they have
nothing to fear. A time is certainly coming when there will be no
more unconscionable dividends. The profits of big concerns must bear
relation to the wages of the workers. I lay down these categorical
propositions, because I know that non-co-operation is beyond the
reach of the bayonet. It has found an abiding place in the Indian
heart. Workers like me will go when the hour has struck, but
non-co-operation will remain. I am aware, too, that the labouring
class in India has not yet become enlightened enough to have the
ability to regulate  the  relations between capital and labour on a
just basis. But that time is coming soon—faster than we may
imagine. I am hoping that the capitalists, be they European or
Indian, will appreciate the new awakening, and the new force that has
arisen in our midst.</p>

Some newspapers, mistaking the apology of the Ali Brothers as of weak
men seeking to avoid the discomfort of the prison life, have
suggested that the Government should take similar undertakings from
those undergoing imprisonment for political offences, and discharge
them. No non-co-operator worthy of his creed can possibly purchase
his discharge by giving any undertaking to the Government. Every one
of them has probably protested his innocence of violent intent. The
Ali Brothers, had they been prosecuted, would still have made the
statement now made. That would not have prevented their imprison-
ment. The makers of the unacceptable suggestion even know that many
have been sentenced for disaffection, or for refusing to give
security that they will not speak. It is the duty of a
non-co-operator to preach disaffection to the existing system of
government, to prepare the country for <i>civil</i><i> </i>disobedience,
to refuse to give security of the</p>

kind just referred to. The Ali Brothers have given no undertaking to
refrain from any of the first two things. If, therefore, the
Government desire to punish only incitement to violence, almost all
the  men recently imprisoned are entitled to be discharged without
any under- taking on their part. So far as non-co-operators are
concerned, they are or ought to be totally indifferent. Prison life
must be the normal life of the majority of them. And it delights me
to read the names of the people who cheerfully prefer imprisonment to
giving under- takings to buy their freedom. When every care is taken
to avoid a breach of his own faith, a non-co-operator may not give
any pledge of any kind whatsoever to anybody.</p>

<i>The </i><i>Leader </i>has blessed me with undeserved compliment
for this programme, and laughed at me for having ever advised the

correspondent of that journal appeals to me definitely to withdraw

even if I wished. The Congress and the Central Khilafat Committee are
the only bodies that possess the power. And my faith in the
destructive part being  as green as ever, I personally could not
abandon it, even if the Congress  and  the Central Khilafat Committee
did so. With them non-violence may not be, with one body it is not,
the final creed. For me, I have nothing beyond non-violence as a
remedy for all ills. Therefore I cannot be party to advising lawyers
to return to their practice, or students to Government schools. Nor
can I be party to lawyers and Government school and college boys
becoming holders of office under the Congress, so long as it retains
its non-co-operationist character.</p>

The Vocal propaganda of the destructive part in the first step in
non-co-operation is over. We know exactly where we  are  re- garding
the titles, the law courts, the schools and  the  councils.  I
believe non-co-operators  are  satisfied  that  these  institutions 
have lost  their  former  prestige.  The  opponents  are  entitled 
to  comfort in the knowledge that the numerical response has not been
large enough to be striking. Those that have responded to the call
consti- tute the most effective, though silent, propaganda in the
direction. But one thing is clear. There can be no resumption of
co-operation till the three conditions laid down by the Congress are
satisfied.</p>

establish swaraj. But I do hold that it is a very substantial step
towards it. The fulfilment of the programme will inspire the nation
with self- confidence, and enable it to take the other steps, if
necessary. One crore electors—for, to become Congress members is to
become  electors for national representatives, for various bodies—is
to find the nucleus for a real electorate under swaraj. To have
twenty lacs of spinning-wheels in working order is to know that India
is determined to drive out poverty, to become self-reliant and to
achieve her  economic independence. The collection of one crore of
rupees is a tangible token of the nation's determination to achieve
her destiny.</p>

We have so fed ourselves with the history of other nations that we
find it impossible to believe that we can attain our end without a
repetition of thirty years' or a hundred years' war, and therefore
without military training and huge armament. We do not care to read
our own history and remember that whilst kings have come and kings
have gone, whilst dynasties have been formed and destroyed, India has
remained unmoved and unaffected. We will not read the lesson of the
late War, that it is not so much military preparation we want as a
change of our own outlook upon India's future. Habit has forced the
conviciton upon us that we, the countless millions, are nothing
before one hundred thousand Englishmen, not all of whom are even
administrators. As soon as we have discarded the awe of the British
rule, and ceased to consider ourselves as cheap as dirt, we shall be
free.   I know that it is possible to perform this revolution of
thought during the year, and it is my hope that India will be ready
for it during the time. Hitherto we have promised ourselves many
things and fulfilled little. If we were to turn up even two-year-old
resolutions of the Congress, we shall find that we have failed even
to send petitions we had resolved upon. Hitherto, we have looked up
to the Government to do everything for us, and we have found it
almost wholly irresponsive in everything that matters. We have
therefore been filled with blank despair. We have ceased to believe
in ourselves or the Government. The present movement is an attempt to
change this winter of our despair ino the summer of hope and
confidence. When we begin to believe in ourselves, Englishmen will, I
promise, begin to believe in us. Then, and not till then, is there
any hope of co-operation between the Government and us. The existing
system of Government, it will be found upon analysis, is based upon a
scientific study of our weak- nesses, which have rather been promoted
by it than reduced. Non-co- operation is, therefore, as much a
protest against our own weaknesses,</p>

as against the inherent corruption of the existing system. British
and Indian, we become impure by belonging to it. The withdrawal from
it of one party purifies both. I invite even the sceptics to follow
the programme of non-co-operation as a trial, and I promise that
there will be swaraj in India during the year, if the programme is
carried out in its-fulness.</p>

question of swaraj; and India's swaraj means the death of the Empire.

Whilst I do not agree with the writer that the interviews were a

concern is not with what British statesmen will or will not do. Our
business is always of endeavour to keep ourselves on the right track.
Our aloofness must not be a sign of our haughtiness or disinclination
to explain our view-points to our opponents. We must be prepared to
approach the world, if we are firm in our own purpose. But I 
recognize, too, the force of the objection that there is danger in
these interviews. Not being in the habit of having always a reserve
of minimum on which there can be no surrender, we may easily slip.</p>

<i>THE VICEROY SPEAKS</i></h1>

What the Viceroy said with reference to Mr. Shafi’s speech is
perhaps equally true of is own. For His Excellency described Mr.
Shafi’s speech as postprandial oratory. I have been, in my early
days, a student more or less accurate of the so-called historic
speeches delivered by various Prime Ministers at the Mansion-house.
They seemed to me to have always an air of unreality about them. And
it grieves me, after having studied the speech of His Excellency the
Viceroy, to have to say that this one also has the same air of
unreality about it. Not that Lord Reading had intended to clothe his
speech with any such air. On the contrary there are in it evident
traces of his having laboured to deliver a true message to an
expectant India. But the speech has failed, in my humble opinion, in
doing so, because of the many limitations that the office of a
Viceroy carries with it. He could not, for instance, override the
tradition of claiming infallibility for British rule. He laid it down
as a proposition’ “beyond the possibility of a doubt”, that
“here in India there can be no trace and must be no trace of racial
inequality”. There is no more unreal proposition to the ear of the
Indian than this, because his experience, be he ever so tall, belies
it. Superiority of race is a passion, has become almost a religion
with the average Englishman. Nor does he strive to conceal it from
view. It obtrudes itself upon you in India as it does in the
Colonies. It is written in the statute-book. One misses in the
Viceregal speech a frank recognition of the many failures of the past
and, therefore, a sincere desire for opening a new page.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">If
His Excellency, in my humble opinion, was hardly happy in</p>

his statement of the ‘fundamental principle of British rule’, he
was, I fear, even less so in his reference to Maulanas Shaukat Ali
and Mahomed Ali. I recognize that he has been exceedingly cautious in
his speech. He has attempted not to wound susceptibilities. As a
matter of fact, there was no question of wounding susceptibilities.
He need not have spared the Maulanas where they might have erred. The
statement made by the Brothers was instigated by me and me along.  It
is an apology tendered to friends, and not to the Government. It is
made not to evade prosecution, but to put themselves right with their
own conscience and with their friends. The assurance to them,
therefore, that there would be no prosecution so long as they abided
by their undertaking was gratuitous, if not offensive. Lord Reading’s
Government is free to take up prosecution against the Brothers at any
moment they choose.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
This campaign of non-co-operation has no reference to diplo- macy,
secret or open. The only diplomacy it admits of is the statement and
pursuance of truth at any cost. The Viceroy showed me the speeches; I
realized that some passages in them did not read well. They were
capable to being interpreted as an incitement to violence, and I
realized that, prosecution or no prosecution, there was no doubt in
my mind as to the advice I should tender to the Brothers. I venture
to suggest to His Excellency that, if he is anxious to disarm non-co-
operators, he will do so only by becoming undiplomatic and abso-
lutely frank. The latter seek and need no shelter or protection, and
I invite His Excellency to reciprocate by not shielding the
offen-ders amongst the governing class.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Indeed, there is no room in the India of to-day and of tomorrow for a
governing class. His Excellency will therefore find out his mistake,
if he clings to the belief that “Indians will respond whole-
heartedly to the just rule which we (British) intend to carry on.”
I venture to prophesy that it is not what the British intend that
will count for the future destiny of India, but what the Indians
themselves intend. And they are claiming more and more insistingly to
 govern themselves, anyhow. Good govern-ment, they are coming to see,
is no substitute for self-government.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The fear, then, is not about His Excellency’s intentions, which I
am convinced are good, but the fear is as to the ideal he is working
for. He thinks of a high destiny which is in store for India at some
indefinable period, whereas non-co-operators at any rate are of 
opinion that India’s high destiny is even now being frustrated by
the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
existing system, which appears to them to be devised for her pro-
longed, if no perpetual, subjection. Sometimes a difference of degree
itself constitutes a difference of ideals. And I hold it to be an
ideal totally different from India’s, when anybody considers that,
whilst the distant goal must be one of freedom for India, its present
state must be that of tutelage. Swaraj is India’s birthright, as
the late Lokamanya Tilak truly said. And India throughout these long,
long years, has been balked of her birthright. No wonder that she has
become impatient.</p>

Lord Reading will, perhaps, now better appreciate the truth of the
proposiiton he has read and heard, viz., that any action of the
Government that falls short of the fullest reparation, however good
it may appear in itself, will, by non-co-operators at least, be
charged with   a bad motive, that of prolonging India’s agony in
her slave-state. British rule, today, lies under a shadow. It is
tainted with the blood of the innocent victims of Jallianwala, and
with treachery towards Islam. And even as the purest milk poured into
a poisonbowl will be counted by every sane man as poison, so will
every act of the British Government be judged in the light of its
immediate past. The unrest of India can only be cured by dealing with
the causes which have brought it about, never by covering the
bitterness thereof by sweets of office or other privileges, no matter
how tempting they may be, if they are not capable of dealing
effectively with the causes themselves.</p>

unable to see that you love your country less than the Nationalists.
I refuse to believe that you are less willing to sacrifice yourselves

I will not weary you with a discussion of the different ideals. I or
the moment, I will simply invite your attention to some of the items
in the constructive programme in the movement of non-co-operation.
You may not like the word itself. You may intensely dislike, as I
know you do, many items in the programme. But if you concede to the
non-co-operators the same credit for love of the land that you will
claim for yourselves, will you not view with favour those parts of
the programme on which there cannot be two opinions? I refer to the
drink evil. I ask you to accept my evidence that the country as a
whole is sick of the drink curse. Those unfortunate men who have
become slaves to the habit require to be helped against themselves.
Some of them even ask to be helped. I invite you to take advantage of
the wave of feeling that has been roused against the drink traffic.
The agitation arose spontaneously. Believe me, the deprivation of the
Government of the drink revenue is of the least importance in the
campaign. The country is simply impatient of the evil itself. In no
country in the world will it be possible to carry on this traffic in
the face of the united and the enlightened opposition of a people,
such as is now to be witnessed in India. Whatever the errors or
excesses that were committed by the mob in Nagpur, the cause was
just. The people were determined to do away with the drink curse that
was sapping their vitality. You will not be deceived by the specious
argument that India must not be made sober by compulsion, and that
those who wish to drink must have facilities provided for them.The
State does not cater for the vices of its people. We do not regulate
or license houses of ill fame. We do no provide facilities for
thieves to indulge their pro- pensity for thieving I hold drink to be
more damnable than thieving and perhaps even prostitution. Is it not
often the parent of both? I ask you to join the country in sweeping
outof existence the drink revenue and abolishing the liquor-shops.

to suggest to you that it is a matter of deep</p>

humiliation for the country to find its children educated from the
drink revenue. We shall deserve the curse of posterity if we do not
wisely decide to stop the drink evil, even though we may have to
sacrifice the education of our children. But we need not. I know many
to you have laughed at the idea of making education self-supporting
by introducing spinning in our schools and colleges. I assure you
that it solves the problem of education as nothing else can. The
country cannot bear fresh taxation. Even the existing taxation is
unbearable. Not only must we do away with the opium and the drink
revenue, but the other revenue has also to be very considerably
reduced if the ever- growing poverty of the masses is to be combated
in the near future.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
And that brings me to the existing system of government. The country
is the  poorer  for  the  Reforms.  The  annual  expenditure  has
grown. A  deeper  study  of  the  system  has  convinced  me  that no
tinkering with it will do. A complete revolution is the greatest need
of the time. The word revolution displeases you. What I plead for,
however, is not a bloody revolution, but a revolution in the thought-
world, such as would compel a radical revision of the standard of
life in the higher services of the country. I must frankly confess to
you that the ever-increasing rate of salaries paid to the higher
branches of the Civil Service fairly frightens me, as I hope it would
frighten you. Is there any correspondence between the life of the
governors and of the governed millions who are groaning under their
heels?  The  bruised bodies of the latter are a standing testimony to
the truth of my statement. You now belong to the governing class. Let
it not be said that your heels are no softer than your  predecessors’
or your associates’. Must you also rule from Simla? Must you also
follow the policy that, only a year ago, you criticized adversely? It
is under your regime that a man has been sentenced to transportation
for life for holding certain opinions. You may not plead that he was
inciting to violence, for not very long ago you dismissed such pleas.
The Ali Brothers have apologized for even a suspicion of violence in
their speeches. You will be doing a cruel injustice to the country if
you allow yourselves to believe that any fear of prosecution has
prompted the apology. A new spirit has been born in the country. The
fear of the judge within is more terrible than that of the one
without. Do you know that during the past six months several
high-souled youths, your</p>

give securiy which, in their opinion, was dishonourable for them to
do? It is under you <i>regime </i>that the patience of utterly 
innocent  Moplas <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>has
been put to a severe test and has as yet not been found wanting. I
would gladly think, as I really believe, that you are not responsible
for the atrocities that are at present being perpetrated in the name
of peace and justice. But you will not let the public or me say that
you are helpless where you are not hoodwinked. That, however, would
bring me to a discussion of our ideals, which I must no enter upon at
the present moment. If the country can only get your assistance in
stopping the drink traffic, you will certainly add to the many
services that you have rendered it in the past, and, maybe, that one
step will open your eyes to many another possibility.</p>

Cow-protection is the dearest possession of the Hindu heart. It is
the one concrete belief common to all Hindus. No one who does not
believe in cow-protection can possibly be a Hindu. It is a noble
belief. I endorse every word of what Professor Vaswani has said in
praise of the cow. Cow-worship means to me worship of innocence. For
me the cow is the personification of innocence. Cow-protection means
the protection of the weak and the helpless. As Professor Vaswani
truly remarks, cow-protection means brotherhood between man and
beast. It is a noble sentiment that must grow by patient toil and
<i>tapasya</i>. It cannot be imposed upon anyone. To carry cow-
protection at the point of the sword is a contradiction in terms.
<i>Rishis </i>of old are said to have performed penance for the sake
of the cow. Let us follow in the footsteps of the <i>rishis</i>, and
ourselves do penance, so that we may be pure enough to protect the
cow and all that  the doctrine means and implies.</p>

take this opportunity of stating that a few months ago I was a
sceptic about the possibilities of the charkha. Being quite
unacquainted with village economics, I doubted as many
paper-economists still do, whether two annas or even three were
enough for a single person’s subsistence, and therefore whether
hand-spinning was a practical proposition. Now, when I see in every
khadi-producing centre scores of women being daily turned back, as I
have to restrict my operations for want of weavers in the areas
concerned, I see all the advantages you advocate as following from
the introduction of hand-spinning on a large scale. But I wish you
would lay some, if not equal emphasis, on the importance of weaving,
as you do on spinning by hand. The loom is not less important than
the wheel for clothing India, as for proving a supplementary industry
for our semi-starved peasantry.</font></font></p>

I do not think there is any danger of hand-weaving not keeping pace
with hand-spinning. Moreover, the existing looms which are weaving
foreign yarn have to be freed. The fact is that we have not as yet
been able to reach the requisite strength in our hand-spun yarn. The
problem now is to improve the quality of hand-spun yarn, so that it
can be easily woven by the ordinary weavers. For the surplus yarn,  I
suggest its use for making ropes, tape, straps and countless other
things that can be easily made. Hand-weaving is not so easily learnt
by all as hand-spinning is. At the same time, I do not wish to be
understood to imply that no special effort needs to be made for hand-
weaving. My point is that it is going on as fast as possible. The
weaver’s wage has increased because of the appreciation of
swadeshi. It ought to have increased. A weaver is any day equal, say,
to a carpenter who gets more than the former.</p>

If Gujarat wills it, it can on its own collect 80 lakhs of rupees by
the end of this month. But Gujarat does not have so much faith in
itself and, therefore, acting like a miser, it has set the limit of
its capacity at Rs. 10 lakhs. In a conference at Broach,
representatives of gujarat pledged themselves after full
deliberation, that they should , as Gujarat's share of the country’s

At the Amritsar session of the Congress, I had pleaded for co-

proclamation. I read in it the Government’s regret [for what had
happened]. I had noted Lord Sinha’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>language. Even Mr. Montagu’s eagerness [that we
should accept the Reforms] was evident. But, afterwards, experience
showed that to co-operate with the Government was to participate in
sin; to non-co-operate is to dissociate oneself from evil, to refuse
to be a traitor and refuse to do injustice. There is no equal justice
for all under this Government. Only on rare occasions does an Indian
get justice. There is a great deal of discrimination between white
and black.</p>

It may be a mark of wisdom not to embark upon a task in the first
instance, but, having undertaken one, it is very necessary that we
see it through. The Gujarat (Political) Conference resolved, on the
holy banks of the Narmada, to collect by the end of this month 10
lakhs of rupees for the Tilak Swaraj Fund, to enrol  three  lakh
Congress members and to make a lakh of spinning-wheels available. If
the Conference doubted its capacity to accomplish all this, it could
have rejected he resolution, but, actually, it embraced the
resolution with enthusiasm. The Conference means the delegates from
Gujarat and Kathiawad. In all seriousness they pledged themselves to
complete these three tasks before June 30. If we fail to make good
the pledge, we shall prove ourselves unfit for swaraj and it will be
difficult for Gujarat to carry on the struggle for it. I believe what
I said at the Conference, namely, that even if only one province in
the country came forward of adopt complete non-co-operation, we would
win swaraj. By its very nature, such action has the property of a
right angle. As, in a quadrangle with equal sides, if one angle is a
right angle the other three are bound to be right angles, so also if
one province comes forward, the others are bound to follow suit. All
that is necessary is to help people overcome their fear. If a few
persons discover the truth about a creature known to be a tiger and,
shedding their fear start playing with it, the others will
immediately join them. One person’s experience serves to teach
others. This is so about swaraj too. What is necessary is for one
large group of people to demonstrate their strength.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
If, however, Gujarat fails in its effort even to learn the letters of
the alphabet, how can it pass the final examination? The Programme
laid down by the Conference is merely a test of one’s abilily to
write the letters. If we fail in this elementary test, we shall only
lose faith in ourselves.</p>

number contribute small sums according to their means or a few,

On the basis of its capacity to pay, Gujarat’s share cannot be just
10 lakhs. If it has not contributed towards public work in the past,
the reason is that it did not want to. It has had its eyes always
fixed on Bombay and, therefore, lacks faith in itself. How can
Viramgam rest satisfied with a contribution of Rs. 12,000? And
Wadhwan with six or seven thousand? These figures are indications of
our apathy towards public work. There was, however, a time when it
wold have been difficult to collect even these amounts in Viramgam or
Wadhwan. If it has been possible to collect them, it should be
possible to collect even more in these two places and so too in other
towns. Every big town should estimate its capacity and collect the
amount falling to its share. In any case, the standards for
collectiong which, after consulting friends, I have recommended to
the public  must  be  applied.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1	</font></sup>No
person wih a fixed salary should give less than 10 per cent of his
monthly pay. People getting big salaries should of themselves give
more and thus cover others whose salaries are low. Business men,
lawyers, doctors and others like them should pay not less than 12 per
cent. For top men among lawyers and doctors, though, how can there be
a fixed percentage?</p>

Can the lawyer, who earns Rs. 60,000 a year contribute only Rs. 5,000

to hand over a hlaf of his earnings. In this way, lawyers of his

I wanted to write at greater length about my tour in the South, but I
have so much to write concerning my later experiences that I must be
content with a brief recital of some important memories only.  I
observe that, wherever there is even a small measure of faith,
wherever there are workers, people give with a generous heart. I have
no time to describe specific instances from my experience in the 
course of this tour. I realized the truth of this from what I saw at
Barsi, Kurduwadi, Pandharpur and Sholapur. There is only one mill at
Barsi. The owner is Shri Yashwantprasad Hariprasad of the Desai
family in Bhavnagar. Though a mill-owner he takes part in every
public acti- vity of the town and makes his conribution. His way of
living deserves to be adopted by other mill-owners. He has built for
himself a small hut like the ones in which the workers live. He, the
mill-workers and the officers joined in contributing to the Tilak
Swaraj Fund. His workers appeared to be contented. Yashwantprasad has
profound faith in the spinning-wheel and himself works to promote its
 use.  He teaches even the children of the mill-workers how to spin.
He wears khadi himself and exhorts ohers to do the same. There is a
good number of other business men in Barsi but, as they did not
contribute their full share, the total amount collected turned out to
be less than expected.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Kurduwadi is merely a railway junction. The population is merely
2,000 and yet nearly 2,000 rupees were collected there. This,
however, was due to the enthusiasm of a single friend from Kutch,
Seth Raymal. Pandharpur is the Kashi of the South but, relatively,
the experience there was disappointing. However, it requries a

From Sholapur we proceeded to Karnatak. We visited Bagalkot and
Bijapur. There was great enthusiasm at both places. The collec- tions
were also good, despite the famine conditions prevailing there. Shri
Kaujalgi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>holds sway in these parts. Recently, the local maistrate
has even done him the kindness to serve a notice upon him. Bijapur is
famous in the history of Muslim rule. It has a number of historic
buildings, mosques and mausoleums. I could go and see Sultan
Mahomed’s tomb and the Jamma Masjid. Nobody in the world is likely
to have spent on tombs as much as Muslim rulers did. The Taj Mahal is
no more than a jewelled tomb, I was told that the “Round Dome”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
the mausoleum is   world-famous.  The  dome  rises  to  a height of
200 feet. There is a gallery running along the vault. One has to go
up 150 steps to reach it. The diameter of the vault must be about 125
feet. Two persons standing at opposite points and talking in
whispers, with their faces towards the wall, can hear each other. The
Jamma Masjid at Bijapur is also an impressive structure. I saw there
a hand-written Koran-e-Sharif which had it leaves beautifully orna-
mented with drawings of creepers. It is, however, the rusty guns and
the ruined forts about which I wish to write. I saw these guns, once
the symbols of imerial glory and objects of terror to the people,
covered with rust and Hindu and Muslim children sitting on them and
playing a horse-riding. The encircling wall,too, I saw,was a heap of
ruins and I was reminded of what I had said about the guns in Colaba.
I believe that, if India fully implements the non-violent
non-co-operation programme, the British guns will rust, wild grass
will grow where they lie buried and our children will play <i>gedi-dada
</i>over the spot and in the forts built by the British Government
through- out the country. Very few have put their faith in what I
said.Some ridiculed it, and</p>

some pitied me for my naivete. But I become more convinced of its
truth as days pass. Would anyone, looking at the Delhi Fort, ever say
that he could have imagined that the Mogul Empire would one day
perish? In the days of that Empire, there must have been persons who
were ridiculed by the people for thinking so. I believe, regardless
of all this, that there is a greater possibility of this Empire
coming down than there might have appeared in the case of the Mogul
Empire. No empire can last in the face of the people’s unfeigned
resentment. It is the cravenhearted whom others seek to frighten. In
this country I often see cripples lying full length on public
pathways. Nobody threatens them because they have banished all fear
from their heart as they lie there. There are quite sure that nobody
will harass them in any way. Their presence causes inconvenience to
thousands of passers-by but the latter endure it. In the same way, if
we become as fearless as these cripples, the guns at Colaba and the
fort will no longer seem ferocious beasts growling at us but appear
as harmless snakes.</p>

As I write these notes, I read in the papers that Shri Kaujalgi
appeared in a court with a white cap and was, therefore, ordered to
remove it. On his refusing to comply, he was fined Rs.200 and was
ordered out of the court for an hour. At the end of the hour, he
again entered the court with the same; unoffending cap. He was,
therefore, again ordered to remove it. He repeated his refusal and
was fined Rs.200 a second time. The magistrate then ordered him to be
produced before another magistrate. Lawyers do not mind practising in
courts in which such lawiessness prevails ! Let the lawyers do what
they will; if the people cling to the foreign cap even after hearing
this, what can be more shameful than that ? When innocent persons are
treated as guilty, one way be sure, trumpets will soon be heralding
the coming of swaraj.But the shackles of slavery will shine more
brightly if, on innocent persons being punished as guilty, people
come to be afraid of doing lawful things. I have seen with my own
eyes long- terms prisoners polishing their chains clean and being
pleased with the shine. The only way to break the bonds of slavery is
to be more determined in our non-co-operation the more they subject
non-co- operators to repression. If in all the courts of Bijapur they
see only white caps, how many persons will the magistrate fine and
how will he</p>

I must be brief in giving my impressions of this conference also. The
conference should be taken as a preparation for the forthcoming
session of the Congress and from that point of view it should be
considered to have done commendable work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The decorations at the Conference were in simple style and only
swadeshi materials had been used in putting them up. Seating arrange-
ments for all were on the ground, the president and a few others
sitting on a cushioned mattress. The buntings were mostly of Khadi. A
swaraj flag was fluttering at the entrance to the <i>pandal</i>.
People refrained from talking noisily and there was no pressure on
space. Seating arrangements for women must be counted very good. The
speech by the Chairman of the Reception Committee was short and
couched in excellent Gujarati. He took only 15 minutes to read it
out. The Presi- dent’s speech, too, was short, simple and framed in
 courteous language. It breathed as much courage as courtesy. We
often assume that bluntness and fiery language are inseparable from
courage and fighting spirit. Shri Vallabhbhai Patel has proved that
pure strength can go with utmost civility. It took him exactly 30
minutes to read out his speech. The brevity of the wo speeches saved
the people much time, imposed no strain on anyone and made it
possible for a great deal of work to be done in two days. The idea of
morning and  evening sessions saved the people from heat. This idea
of holding our meetings in the early morning needs to be popularized
among us. In summer, especially, all meetings should be held in the
early For an ailing man like me, they provided a chair. We should
give up this practice and, in place of the chair, introduce the
old-style <i>bajath</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>One solitary chair in the midst of others squatting on
the ground or on the dais presents an unbecoming sight. We must
convince people that a chair is not necessary for showing respect to
a man. At one meeting, the provision of chairs led to an embarrassing
situation. Only two chairs were provided, one to enable me to speak
sitting and the others for the President. Then came a gentleman, a
stranger, a little after the meeting had already started. Though all
others sat squatting, the gentleman felt that he would be inviting
loss of dignity of he did the same. I took in the situation. I did
not think it would be proper to explain to him that no loss of
dignity was involved in the matter.</p>

Immediately, therefore, I vacated the chair for him and I myself sat
on the President’s table. Had only a <i>bajath </i>been provided
for me, the embrrassing situation would not have arisen. The incident
was of no consequence in itself, but it holds a useful lesson.</p>

The volunteers must be given credit for rendering good service. The
results of the training given by Shri Purani were quite evident. All
the same, I felt that there was room for greater efficiency. I saw
that they did not quite know how to stop people from making noise.
They were also wont to collect in small groups. They were perhaps
lacking in courtesy to children. A nation which denies respect to its
children, women and domestic servants loses its culture. Those,
especially, who would serve the public should protect the weak as a
part of their duty, address them wih respect and make things easy for
them.</p>

Volunteers at any rate must wear nothing but khadi. Most of the
delegates attending the Conference were dressed in foreign cloth.
This was a painful sight. It is nine months now since the pledge of
swadeshi was taken and, if even delegates do not put away the love of
foreign cloth, are frightened by the heavincess of khadi clothes  or
feel ashamed of such clothes, it would be like the sea catching fire.
Where shall we find the man who will put our such a fire? I know that
the turban and the dhoti present serious difficulties. If we try,
however, we can think of and adopt some changes in regard to both
these matters. One requires five yards’ lengh for a dhoti of fine
count. But three and a half yards should suffice if the cloth is
coarse. If we require a width of 54 inches for a dhoti of fine count,
we should be able to manage with 45 inches for one of coarse cloth.
There should be no difficulty at all in getting a piece of white
khadi dyed and then set as a turban. Should a turban of this type be
felt too heavy, one ought to carry on with a khadi cap till such time
as fine khadi can be produced.</p>

It would be a very good thing if, at the forthcoming session of the
Congress, we let people see nothing but khadi in Gujarat. Will
Gujarat lose anything thereby? On the contrary, it will have filled
with plenty the homes of some poor people. Anyone who buys one yard
of khadi adds not less than three annas to a poor man’s resources.
I but one yard of khadi has so much power in it, how will anybody
refuse to wear it? Only the man who wears khadi with a clear purpose
knows what intense patriotism it symbolizes.</p>

funds is unforgettable. There was a regular stream of them,</p>

one following another. They rained jewellery and coins in profusion.
The men also caught the infection and, it must be said, gave
handsomely. While, on the one hand, so much generosity was shown by
both men and women, on the other I heard that two men were angry with
their wives who had offered some articles of jewellery. Jewellery is
the wife’s property and the husband has no right of any kind with
regard to it. It is my humble opinion that men should not object if
women use their jewellery to help a good cause.</p>

But I must declare myself to have been as much disappointed in regard
to the women’s clothes as I felt happy over. their generosity.
Perhaps in no other part of India has the use of English, Japanese

This matter deserves the serious attention of women. For the sake of
India, for safeguarding the virtue of the women of the Poorer classes
in the country, the women of Gujarat should voluntarily put up with
he heaviness of khadi saris. An exhibition of khadi, spinning- wheels
and hand-ginning tools was organized as part of the Con- ference.
There was no special novelty about the spinning-wheels, but they
displayed a number of ingenious devices. While some were light and
portable, so that one could carry them about on a journey, some were
attractive in appearance or deserved praise for their strength.
Perhaps there is nothing on which so much skill is being employed as
what artisans at innumerable places are spending these days on the
spinning-wheel. It is my prayer that we may succeed in making the
forthcoming session of the Congress and the attendant exhibition
models for such affairs.</p>

The difference between two places, one in which preparatory work has
been done and which has a few sincere workers at least and another in
which no such work has been done, was clearly seen at Sarkhej and
Sanand. At Sarkhej, 1,200 rupees could be collected in one hour from
a population of about 2,000, while at Sanand, which has 5,000
residents and enjoys a good trade, the collection came to a mere 500.
There is a national school in Sarkhej. There was complete quiet and
order in the meeting at Sarkhej, men and women attended in equal
numbers and a joint meeting served the purose. At Sanand, separate
meetings for men and women were held and at both there was no end of
noise and disorder. The meeting at Sarkhej was open to <i>Antyajas
</i>also. From among the 20 families of <i>Antyajas </i>there, they</p>

I do not wish to run down Sanand by this criticism. I am cerain that,
if a few men of character work as volunteers in Sanand and induce
some local gentleman to take interest in their work, the place can
stand alongside of Sarkhej. I hope that some volunteer or other will
go and post himself in Sanand and the needed awakening will follow. I
suggest to the residents of Sanand that they should, without delay,
put the public work there on an organized basis and see that the
place gets the credit it deserves.</p>

Referring to my statement that I would never be guilty of seek- ing
India’s good at the expense to any other country,a young man asks
me what I have to say about the great harm to England which is bound
to follow from the spinning-wheel movement and non-co- operation.
Such question are asked again and again. Questions which spin very
fine sound good; however, if the questioners give up spin- ning with
their mind and take to spinning with the wheel, their mental knots
will get unravelled by themselves. I do not at all believe that any
harm can come to Engalnd from the spinning-wheel movement or
non-co-operation. They are both menas of self-purification. They will
purify us and England as well. Just as we may think that the closing
of liquor-booths will harm the proprietors and the customers, so may
we take a like view of non-co-operation and the spinning-wheel. I do
not, besides, believe in setting fire to my house so that I might go
on a pilgrimage. As I would not think of harming a foreign country,
so would I not permit harm to my own. Just as trade with Manchester
harms India and, therefore, deserves to be given up, so Inida’s
opium trade with China harms the latter and I, therefore, believe
that it must be given up. If anybody has been exploiting us and if we
seek by non-violent efforts to end the exploitation, no harm can come
to the other party.</p>

This same friend is still sceptical about Hindu-Muslim unity. He
writes: “So long as Muslims kill even one mute creature in  the
country or follow the practice of suspending chameleons in their
<i>taboots</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Crores of Hindus kill other animals and, in the name of religion,
suspend creatures as the Muslims do the chameleon and yet we do not
fight with them. Why, then, should we quarrel with the Muslims?
Tolerance is also one of the virtues of Hinduism as it is of other
faiths. Out of regard and love for the Hindus, Muslims refrain these
days from killing the cow. I give them my thanks for this, and I
think everybody should do the same.</p>

This is Maulana Mahomed Ali’s first visit to Ahmedabad. You have
given him a cordial welcome and are naturally eager to hear him. I
did not wish to stand between you and him for long but, when I
arrived here, I felt as if stabbed with a dagger. I cannot now finish
in a few minutes. When, at Sabarmati, I learnt that the Maulana Saheb
had already arrived, I felt really glad and I forthwith came over
here. But what was the first thing I heard on arriving here? That the
workers had not reported themselves for duty today. They went to the
mills and came away. By acting in this way, they have brought shame
on themselves, on Anasuyabehn and on Banker. How you have brought
shame on these two, you may reason out for yourselves. In any case,
you have most certainly put me to shame.</p>

Mill-workers will not succeed in exploiting me. To tell the truth,  I
believe that nobody in the country can exploit me. I, who am striv-
ing for the freedom of the country shall not be a slave of workers.
Perhaps you imagine that Anasuyabehn is only a woman and she can be
hoodwinked; and Gandhi is an old man, a withering leaf, all the time
out touring the country and he too can be fooled. But you will not
succeed. Just now you heard the poem about a tyrant sung by our
friend Akhtar. One who wishes to be free from the tyranny of the
oppressor will not seek to ensalve others. You would have honoured
Maulanas Shaukat Ali and Mahomed Ali best by remaining in the mills
and working. You took three holidays to celebrate the  <i>Id</i>.

You seem to think that Gandhi really wants violence to break out but,
being a 'big' man, he cannot say so openly and, therefore, when he
asks you to avoid violence, you must understand him to mean that you
should resort to it. It is not right for you to draw such a
wrong-headed conclusion. YOu did that in April 1919, and killed two
innocent persons. Do not persuade yourselves that Gandhi is a big man
and, therefore, when he urges you not to set fire to buildings or
draw the sword, your duty is to do the opposite. Le me warn you that,
if you commit a similar mistake again, you will find that your knife
has cut Gandhi’s throat. If you think that Gandhi, who loves you
like his kith and kin, means just the opposite of what he openly
says, you will be cutting his throat with your knife. I tremble at
the very thought of your committing such mistakes. I ask you: what
business had you to leave your mills? A few men shouted at you and
you walked out ! It is not manliness that you have exhibited by
running away in this way. If Muslims want to save the Khilafat and
Hindus their Hinduism and both their motherland, then they will have
to be brave as lions. They cannot afford to be lambs. We do not want
to follow the ways of lawless men. We do not seek to save Islam and
Hinduism in that way. We are out to show that we are brave men. We do
not want to meet deceit with deceit. We do not want to kill the man
who comes to kill us, but have decied to lay down our own lives
instead. Understand this very clearly. By their conduct today, the
workers have disgraced me, have insulted the Maulana Saheb and
obstructed the work for swaraj, the Khilafat andIndia. They have
checked the rising moon of swaraj, have eclipsed it. How can you do
anything which may make me lose heart— one who am wholly engrossed
in one single task? I had such faith in the workers. I thought the
noble workers who, sitting daily under a tree for 23 days<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, took a pledge with God as witness, would never forget
Him. But today you did not think about the Khilafat, about Hinduism
and about India.</p>

that the mill-owners will trample you down. Such fear becomes lambs.
The strong will not feel afraid in this way. They cannot be crushed

If you want us to work for you, do not understand us to mean the

have earned millions, they will say, they have also given. something
to the workers, and they must, in return, make good use of the money
they give them. If the workers go on spending money the way they do
at present, these mill-owners will tell me, India will forget all
self-control.  I do not wish this to happen but that is the path you
seem to have taken. Had I been a mill-owner myself, I would have
shown you that you could never succeed in making me your slave. They
are lambs before you at present. The mill-owners and you are both

other. And so you do not want that, as a result of your seeking their

I wish to tell you about the regret expressed by the Ali Brothers. Do
you think they have done so to escape imprisonment? They are in no
way afraid of it. All three of us are working so that we may be
hanged during this year. Have they, then, expressed regret for your
sake? Not at all. They have done so for the sake of others who are
working sincerely to secure justice on the Khilafat issue. I told
them that their speeches were much to vehement and some persons might
conclude from them that they wished to incite them to violence. They
accepted my humble advice and declared frankly  to  the  whole
country that they did not want violence. The Borhters know that peace
and the sword are no friends of each other. They have declared that,
if non-co-operation fails to solve the Khilafat issue, they will take
up the sword and kill the enemy or be killed themselves and thus
force a soluiton. My own religion forbids me to take up arms. I would
not kill anybody. I would lay down my own life to save Hinduism
rather than kill another. Despite this difference between the Ali
Brothers and myself, I have been able to convince them that, at the
present time, it would be best for us not to take up arms. They have
not expressed regret in order to save themselves from being
imprisoned. It is,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
however, wrong to invite imprisonment by losing control over our
emotions. If we try to purify ourselves and make sacrifices, and if
the tyrant arrests us for doing so, the world will spit upon him. If
a sincere, holy man is sent to the gallows, the oppressor will invite
upon himself the contempt of the entire world. We wish that the
Govern- ment lays its hands on us and hangs us. If Ahmedabad, if
Inida, views in a different light the regret expressed by the Ali
Brothers, they are wrong. Day by day, we are growing stronger in our
nobility. You should cultivate discipline and be men of nobility. If
you do not like a particular thing and, having expressed your
disapproval, you resist it, one can understand that; but how can it
be tolerated if you take the law into your own hands? If you learn
this truth, you will have it in your hands to secure justice on the
Punjab and the Khilafat issues and win swaraj.</p>

I wish to tell you a word or two as regards my relations with the Ali
Brothers. I do not think we are any the less close to each other than
brothers born of the same mother. I have known them from the time of
my visit to Delhi in 1915. I have no left them, nor they me, since
that day. They are orthodox Muslims, and I claim to be a strict
Hindu. They do not wish that I should compromise my religion, nor I
that they should compromise theirs. Though adhering to our respec-
tive faiths, we have developed such relations that we are ready to
mount the gallows together and be reduced to ashes. Both Hinduism and
Islam possess this nobility.</p>

No other class of people in the country has shown evidence of as much
awakening as the women. In the past they never attended national
meetings in any great number. But now they go in their thousands to
meetings everywhere. To a man of faith like me, this very fact is an
auspicious sign. It tells me that we are nearing the day when we
shall have the rule of dharma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
Even if other classes of people in the country do nothing to uphold
its honour, women by themselves can uphold it. They have at all times
preserved dharma, have laid down their lives for its sake. Women like
Sita and Damayanti have endured untold hardships in following dharma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
Women, in their large-heartedness, even keep alive hundreds of
superstitions and senseless practices. If these same women realize
the importance of national work, is there anything they can not do ?
The naitonal treasury would not remain unfilled after that.</p>

The late Lokamanya Tilak’s name is not unknown to women, nor is his
memory less dear to them. His strength of character sheds lusture on
India and his self-sacrifice is a sustaining memory for the country.
Gujarat has been called upon to contirbute 10 lakhs to a fund for
perpetuating his memory and establishing swaraj. Women can give cash
and jewellery to this Fund. What should women have to do with
jewellery in these times ? How can have the heart to wear ornaments
when crores of Indians go hungry and tyranny stalks the land? Was
Sitaji in Ashok vatika decked in jewellery? Were there any ornaments
on Damayanti’s person when she went crying in a frenzy of grief in
the fores? Was Taramati bedecked in necklaces of pearls and dismonds
when she accomanied Harishchandra in his wander- ings? To me at any
rate it seems an unworthy thing to wear jewellery in these times when
<i>adharma</i><i> </i>prevails.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
To those women who keep jewellery as provision against a rainy day, I
will only say this: “If you trust God, that trust will help you
more han your jewellery. Remember that there are crores of women in
India who do not own even a small rin of gold weighin no more han a
few grains and who have no where to lay heir heads on. God provides
food even to these. If you, too, feel no shame in doing physical
work, your sacred hands and feet will serve you better than your
jewellery will. God will assuredly give food to those to whom He has
given</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
teeth. No honest person who is prepared to work has at any time gone
without food. It is only the lazy who feel compelled to depend on
jewellery. Let women shake off laziness and also discard jewellery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
The money which women contribute will be so used that it will serve
the same purpose as jewellery for it will be spent for supplying
spinning-wheels to poor women and imparting the right kind of
education to our children. In other words, the money and  the
jewellery donated by women will profit none else but women. The man
who keeps his earnings and spends them for his own pleasures is
regarded as a selfish fellow and a traitor to the family, while the
man who puts his earnings in the family safe gets the same benefit
from their use as the former from his, but is looked upon as a
selfless man and a servant of the family. Serving the country means
looking upon the country as one’s family. Of the money which we
contribute the naitonal treasury, too, we get the full advantage.
Just as our fellow- countrymen get the benefit of the money we put
into this treasury, so do we have the benefit of the money which they
put into it. Thus, the women who give any money or jewellery to the
naitonal fund will lose nothing at all.</p>

their families to help in this matter. It often happens that, owing
to the extravagant habits of their womenfolk, men are not able to
contribute to naional causes as much as they would like to. At times,
women actually stop their husbands from contributing. I appeal to
them to desist from this and to encourage the men to give something.
I am also not ignorant of the fact that there are many women who even
urge their menfolk to give more rather than less and succeed in their
attemts. Let other women follow the example of these.</p>

It is my prayer to those women who read this leaflet to persuade
others to read it. I hope that women will not be content with giving
something themselves but will also induce thier friends to do so.</p>

The Ali Borthers’ apology still continues to tax people’s minds.
I continue to receive letters expostulationg with me for having gone
to the Viceroy at all. Some consider that I have bungled the whole
affair; others blame the Brothers for having for once weakened, and
that in defernce to me. I know that in a short while the storm will
blow over. For, in spite of all I have heard and read, I feel that I
did the right thing in responding to the Viceroy’s wish to know my
views. It would have been wrong on my part to have waited for a
formal written inviation from His Excellency. I feel, too, that I
gave the best advice possible in the interests of Islam and India,
when I asked the Brothers to make the statement issued by them. The
Ali Brothers have showed humility and courage of a high order in
making the statement. They have shown that they are capable of
sacrificing their pride and their all for the sake of their faith and
country. They have served the cause by making the statement, as they
would have injured it by declining to make it.</p>

In spite of all that conviction in me, I am not surprised at the
remonstrances I am receiving. They but show that the methods now
being pursued are new, that the country will not surrender a little
of its just demands, and for their satisfaction, it wishes to purely
rely upon is own strength.</p>

I give below the relevant parts of the strongest argument in
condemnation of my advice and its acceptance by the Brothers. The
letter, moreover, is written by one of the greatest among the non-co-
operators. It is not written for publication at all. But I know the
writer will not mind my sharing it with the reader. For I have no
doubt that he represents the sentiments of several thoughtful
non-co-operators. It is my humble duty to discuss the issues arising
from the incident, and the implications of non-co-operation. It is
only by patient reasoning that I hope to be able to demonstrate the
truth, the beauty and the reasonableness of non-co-operation. Here
then are the extracts:</p>

The apology of the Brothers is not made to the Government. It is
addressed and tendered to friends, who drew their attention to their</p>

speeches. It was certainly not given ‘at the bidding of the
Viceroy’. I betray no confidence when I say that it was not even
sugg-ested by him. As soon as I saw the speeches, I stated, in order
to prove the <i>bona </i><i>fides </i>of the Brothers and the
entirely non-violent character of the Movement, that I would invite
them to make a statement. There was no question of bargaining for
their freedom. Having had my attention drawn to their speeches, I
could not possibly allow them to go to gaol (if I could prevent it)
<i>on </i><i>the </i><i>ground </i><i>of </i><i>proved incitement </i><i>to
</i><i>violence</i>.  I have given same advice to all the accused,
and told them that, if their speeches were violent, they should
certainly express regret. A non-co- operator could not do otherwise.
Had the Brothers been charged before a court of law, I would have
advised them to apologize to the court for some of the passages in
their speeches which, in my opinion, were capable of being
interpreted to mean incitement to violence. It is not enough for a
non-co-operator not to mean violence, it is necessary that his speech
must not be capable of a contrary interpretation by reasonable men.
We must be above suspicion. The success of the Movement depends upon
its retaining its absolute purity. I therefore suggest to the writer
and to those who may think like him that the whole principle of
non-co-operation has not only not been ‘given away’ as the writer
contends, but its non-violent character has been completely
vindicated by the Brothers’ apology, and  the  case therefore
greatly strengthened.</p>

That very fact shows the real character of non-co-operation. A
non-co-operator may not bargain for personal safety. It was open to
me to bargain for the liberty of the others. <i>Then </i>I would have
given away the whole case for non-co-operation. I did not bargain
even for the Brothers’ liberty. I stated in the clearest possible
terms that, no matter what the Government did, it would be my duty on
meeting the Brothers to advise them to make the statement to save
their honour.</p>

We must ‘play the game’, whether the Government reci- pro- cate

may wish, does wish to do right and justice. But he will not be
permitted to. If the Government were honourable, they would have set
free all the prisoners as soon as they decided not to prosecute the
Ali Brothers. If the Government were honourable, they would not have
caught youths and put them in prison, whilst they left Pandit Motilal
Nehru the arch-offender free. If the Government were honourable, they
would not countenance bogus Leagues of Peace. If the Government were
honourable, they would have long ago repented for their heinous
deeds, even as we have for every crime committed by our people in
Amritsar, kasur, Viramgam, Ahmedabad, and recently in Malegaon. I
entertain no false hopes or misgivings about the Gover- rnment. If
the Government were tomorrow to arrest the Ali Brothers, I would
still justify the apology. They have acted in the square, and we must
all do likewise. Indeed, inasmuch as the Government are still
arresting people for disaffection, they are arresting the Ali
Brothers.</p>

The writer is, again, not taking a correct view of non-co- operation
in thinking that non-co-operators, who are in gaol, are less
fortunate than we who are outside. For me, solitary confinment in a
prison cell, without any breach on my part of the code of non-co-
operation, or private or public morals, will be freedom. For me, the
whole of India is a prison, even as the master’s house is to his
slave. A slave, to be free, must continuously rise against his
slavery and be locked up in his master’s cell for his rebellion.
The cell-door is the door to freedom. I feel no pity for those who
are suffering hardships in the gaols of the Government. Innocence
under an evil Government must ever rejoice on the scaffold. It was
the easiest thing for the Brothers to have rejected my advice, and
embraced the opportunity of joining their comrades in the gaols. I
may inform the reader that, when during the last stage of the South
African struggle I was arrested,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

was in the prisons of South Africa that I had leisure and peace from

summons from Madras to answer the charge of disaffection in
connection with a speech delivered two months ago at Bezwada. There
is no question of incitement to violence, as the charge itself would
show. Section 124A, under which Mr. Gidwani is charged, run: “Whoever
        attempts to bring into hatred to contempt, or excites</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; line-height: 102%">

No one preaches hatred or disaffection towards the King. The
disaffection which Mr. Gidwani must have preached, the Ali Brothers
are preaching ceaselessly. No one, perhaps, excels me in harbouring
and promoting disaffection towards it. Indeed, I hold it to be the
duty of every good man to be disaffected towards the existing
Government, if he considers it, as non-co-operators consider it, to
be evil. Having decided not to prosecute the Ali Brothers, the
Government should have stopped all prosecutions exept for violence.
But under  the existing system of Government, even an ex-Lord Chief
Justice of England cannot prevent a divorce between profession and
practice, unless he tears himself from his environment, and
supersedes the corrupt traditions of a corrupt system.</p>

The lase sentence is evidently a friendly hit at me. It is to remind
me that I have said some complimentary things about Lord Reading and
Sir George Lloyd. My compliments stand notwithstanding these
revelations. They prove the essence of my charge against the system,
that it makes the best of administrators powerless for  good.  Sir
George, probably, has as much influence over the Commissioner of Sind
as he has over a street urchin. He has to fear the former, and can,
if he wishes, even frighten the latter. The great feat of Lord
Reading’s is to invite Mr. Thompson of the Punjab fame to accept a
higher post, and succeed in inducing him to condescend to do so. Sir
George Lloyed, where he can personally supervise, shows himself to be
tactful and yielding as a rule. Lord Reading can procure palliatives,
as in the case just mentioned. But Sir George will not resign,
because the Commissioner of Sind says he is as good as Governor
Lloyd. Nor would Lord Reading resign, because the officials in the
plains laugh at his intentions to do justice. Both honestly believe
that, without them, theings might at least have been worse.
Non-co-operation has stepped in to show to all who care that they may
not flirt with evil and hope to do good. When the basis is evil, a
superstructure of good adds strength to evil. It would be wrong to
blame such administrators because they fail, for they fail in spite
of themselves. Our non-co-operation will open their eyes to the depth
of the evil that is in the system if we will</p>

But all this academic discussion about the merits and demerits of
administrators can bring little comfort to the Sindhi sufferers; I
tender my congratulations to them for their courage and patience
under very trying circumstances. If they continue to suffer patiently
and bravely, the end will be brought nearer by this unbridled and
unscrupulous repression. We must try, by patient endurance, to win
over to us our misguided countrymen who become easy tools in the
hands of unprincipled officials. Gradually, as in other parts of
India, so in Sind, the villagers will shed the fear of the officials,
and welcome Congress and Khilafat men as their real friends and
deliverers. If we have faith, presently it will become impossible to
play the Mohammedans against the Hindus and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

Foreign cloth has made such encroachments upon our life that we use
it even for sacred purposes. Thus I noticed the use of foreign cloth
for the decoration of idols in Puri and Ayodhya, and, indeed, in
almost all the temples I have visited. Even the sacred thread is not
always handmade. It refreshes me, threfore, to find a correspondent
from Sind sending the news that Acharya Gidwani of the Gujarat
Vidyapith was the first, when he recently visited Sind, to present a
khadi cover for the Granth Saheb instead of foreign silk which is
usually presented. I hope the good example will be followed by all
devotees and foreign cloth replaced in all temples by khadi.</p>

This is a typical letter. And it is the universality, almost of the
attitude, that set me against the present system of education years
ago,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="127. THE LESSON OF ASSAM"></a>
and made me change the course of the education of all my boys and
others with (in my opinion) excellent results. The hunt after
position and status has ruined many a family, and has made many
depart from the path of rectitude. Who does not know what
questionable things fathers of families in need of money for their
children’s education have considered it their duty to do ? I am
convinced that we are in for far worse times, unless we change the
whole system of our education. We have only touched the fringe of an
ocean of children. The vast mass of them remain without education,
not for want of will but of ability and knowledge on the part of the
partents. There is something radically wrong, especially for a nation
so poor as ours, when parents have to support so many grown-up
children, and give them a highly expensive education without the
children making any immediate return. I can see nothing wrong in the
children, from the  very  threshold of their education, paying for it
in work. The simplest handicraft suitable for all, required for the
whole of India, is undoubtedly spinning along with the previous
processes. If we introduced this in our educational institutions, we
should fulfil three purposes: make education self-supporting, train
the bodies of the children as well as their minds, and pave the way
for a complete boycott of foreign yarn and cloth. Moreover, the
children thus equipped will become self-reliant and independent. I
would suggest to the correspondent that he should invite all the
membes of his family to contribute to its upkeep by spinning or
weaving. Under my scheme, no child is entitled to education who does
not spin a minimm quantity of yarn. Such amilies will acquire a
prestige for self-respet and independence not hitherto dreamt of.
This scheme does not exclude a liberal education, but on the contrary
brings it within the easy reach of every boy or girl, and restores
literary training to its original dignity by making it primarily a
means of mental and moral culture, and only secondarily and
indirectly a means of livelihood.</p>

and wept over the considered written address of Mr. Andrews,
delivered in Calcutta just after his return from the scene of the
Assam tragedy, which is as yet by no means over. Mr. Andrews writes
and says what he thinks. He does not hide the truth from himself or
others. He wears himself out in ceaselessly serving humanity. He is
as ready to confess his errors as he is to bring charges against the
highest in the land, if he finds them to be true. And just because he
is true, staunch and godfearing, some newspapers dismiss him with
contempt when they do not abuse him. Yet his statements about Fiji,
South Africa, East Africa, Ceylon, the Punjab, remain as true today
as when they were made. Most of them have been admitted by the

But the purpose of writing these lines is not to defned Mr. Andrews.
My object in referring to the Assam tragedy is to save my own
conscience, and draw a moral from it. As soon as the coolies struck
work, I received a wire asking me to go to the scene of what has
developed into a national affiction. But I telegraphed and wrote to
all  I could think of. I had not the courage to leave the work in
hand. No man dare leave the service to which he is called, however
humble it may be, for answering a call to another, however high it
may be, unless there is a clear way open to it. I found none. I could
not leave the task in hand. The dumb labourers and God will forgive
me if I have erred. For I feel that I am fully serving the labourers
whilst I am occupied with the ceaseless prosecution of the Bezwada
programme. My grief over my helplessness is all the greater because,
somehow or other, the labourers have come to think that they will
find me by their side, wherever and whenever they may be in trouble.
I am humble enough to know that, in the vast majority of cases, I can
send them nothing but my heartfelt prayers and sympathy. The spirit
is indeed willing, but the flesh is incapable. I hear, I feel and
fret over the hopeless incapacity to help.</p>

The Assam tragedy has enabled Mr. Andrews to draw up a terrible
indictment against the Indian Government. The callous indifference,
in the name of impartiality, shown to the immediate watns of the
labourers, even assuming that they were in the wrong, the charge of
the Gurkhas and the hackenyed defence of the necessity of using force
against a perfectly helpless people, mark out the Government as
barbarous and utterly unworthy of respect. Why were the Gurkhas let
loose upon the coolies ? Everyone knows that the army contains some
men simply trained to be brutal and inhuman. When the soldiery is
sent in the midst of an unarmed civil population, people know what
that means. Everyone knows that the recruits for the army contain
some of the worst specimens of humanity. They</p>

may be good for war, but to employ them for dealing with coolies on
strike is to side with the rich and the powerful. In every vital
matter the Reforms are hopelessly breaking down. There is no doubt
that the next few months will witness either a transformation in the
sys-tem of Government so that the meanest will count as much as the
lofti-est, or a conflict with it such as the world has never seen
before. The refusal to take the rice offered in name of the
Government was a refusal to live by the hand that humbled. And when
that spirit of quiet courage and resignation pervades India, the fate
of the Government is sealed. We need to learn, not the art of doing
violence but that of suffering violence, of dying. Success by methods
of violence will replace one monster of Government by another, and
the poor and the innocent will certainly continue to be ground down
just as they are today.</p>

Mr. Andrews deplored the sympathetic strike of the steamship
employees. Whosoever instigated it did an ill service to the
labourers. In India we want no political strikes. We are not yet
instructed enough for them. Not to have politcal strikes is to
forward the cause  of freedom. We do not need an atmosphere of
unsettled unrest. It hampers our progress towards the final stages of
our programme. A soldier who runs amok is unfit to be in an army. We
must gain control voer all the unruly and distrubing elements, or
isolate them even as we are isolating the Government. The only way,
therefore, we can help strikers is to give them help and relief when
they have struck for their own <i>bona-fide </i>grievances. We must
sedulously prevent all  other strikes. We seek not to destroy capital
or capitalists, but to regulate the relations between capital and
labour. We want to harness capital to our side. It would be folly to
encourage sympathetic strikes.</p>

The District Magistrate of Lahore has been prohibiting  a meeting of
the Lahore City Congress Committee. Under the Seditious Meetings Act,
public meetings are understood to be meetings to which  a member of
the public can demand entrance on com- pliance with the rules of
admission. All other meetings are private. The Lahore Committee
meeting was advertised to be only for members of the Committee. But
the Magistrate was not satisfied. He asked the Secretary to wait on
him and give him satisfaction. Lala Amirchand naturally declined to
dance attendance on the Magistrate, and politely informed him that
the meeting was private and had a definite object. The Magistrate
nevertheless prohibited the meeting. The Secretary protested that the
order was illegal, but informed the Magistrate that he would for the
time being obey the order. It is quite evident that the officials are
challenging and provoking non-co-operators  to  offer civil
disobedience. A few more such orders, and I promise that the
challenge will be heartily taken up. Hitherto, we have obeyed such
orders out of our weakness. Now we are obeying out of strength which
is daily growing. All over the country, wherever such orders are
given, the desire is keen for civil disobedience. It is the exemplary
self-restraint and self-imposed discipline which are keeping those
who receive such orders from civilly disobeying them. The country
will gain fro having undergone still more discipline and exercise
still more self-restraint. We shall need much more of both these
qualities, before we can regard ourselves as fit for the privileged
exercise of civil disobedience. Disobedience to be civil excludes all
bluster, all vio- lence. It excludes lawlessness. A civil resister
<i>courts </i>imprisonment. It is, therefore, wrong to demonstrate
against his arrest. There must be real rejoicing, as there is when
one has one’s  heart’s desire fulfilled.There could be civil
disobedience tomorrow, if we could ensure its restriction strictly to
approved laws and orders, if we could be sure that the people would
not resort to violence on the arrest of prominent leaders. Civility
is to dis-obedience what non-violence is to non-co-operation.
Disobedience is the acutest form of non-co- operation—more so than
non-payment of taxes. A civil resister becomes law unto himself.
Courage and discrimination of a  high  order are needed for the
practice of the virtue of civil disobedience. It is a total denial of
the authority of the State, and is permissible only</p>

when the State has proved itself currupt beyond redemption. I may be
stupid, but I see not only no sign of repentance about this Govern-
ment of ours, but I notice a determination on its part to provoke
people to vio-lence, and, then, to justify a repetition of Dyerism.
The refusal to right the Punjab wrong in the only way possible means
that on the people go-ing mad as in Amritsar, their sins will be
visited upon the innocent and the guilty alike, and that, in the
words of one of the Amritsar officers, the future generations must be
made to pay for the sins of the present.</p>

A forced imposition of the British yoke is intolerable and
humiliating. A nation awakened to a sense of its self-respect will
and must go through the fire of suffering, and bear all the hardships
that may be entailed in throwing off the yoke. The English can remain
in India only as friends and equals, and if they serve, they must
become real servants, scrupulously carrying out the wishes of their
employers. There can be no exploitation of Indian labour, and no
concessions to British capitalists. They must compete with the
meanest of us on equal terms. Their organizing talent, their
industry, their resourcefulness must command a market which none can
dispute. But the menace of their rifle and their whip must cease for
ever. The refusal to redress the Punjab wrong, the refusal to placate
Mussulman opinion means that the menace is not to cease. On our part,
there must be no compromise with that attitude. Weak or strong, we
must fight it to the bitter end, cost what it may. As soon,
therefore, as we have secured a reasonably safe atmosphere for the
working of civil disobedience, we must launch out into it. <i>Meanwhile</i>,
let us submit even to the preposterous orders such as the Lahore
District Magistrate’s. The power of rightful disobedience will come
tomorrow, from willing obedience today.</p>

the struggle, I would gladly wait on him. I waited on him, not for
the sake of securing a reversal of the decision to arrest the Ali
Brothers, but to tell the Viceroy why I had become a non-co-operator.
The first and the longest interview did not turn upon the then
impending prosecution of the Brothers at all. The question of the Ali
Brothers came up quite in the natural course, and arose out of our
discussion of non-violence and how far it was carried out in
practice. When His Excellency showed me some of the extracts from the
speeches, I recognized that they were capable of bearing the
interpretation sought to be put upon them. I therefore told His
Excellency that as soon as I met them, I would advise the Brothers to
make a clearing statement, irrespective of what the Government may do
regarding their prosecution. The statement was not conditional upon a
revision of the Government’s decision. That the Government revised
the decision on the strength of the statement was a wise and natural
act on their part. I admit that it has given me relief. But I do</p>

not believe with Mr. Pal that the arrest of the Brothers would
necessarily have led to bloodshed. The Brothers, like me, continue
wilfully to break the law of sedition, and, therefore court arrest. 
Sooner or later, and that during this year if we can carry the
country with us, we must bring about a situation when the Government
must arrest us or grant the people’s demands. The Brothers’
statement avoids arrest on a false issue, an issue that cannot be
defended.</p>

Whilst, therefore, I was anxious to avoid the prosecution of the
Brothers on the ground of incitement to violence, I would welcome a
prosecution of them and myself for promoting disaffection towards the
Government established by law. We all felt that, having known what
was taking place, not to make the statement would be to wrong the
cause, and to play into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 110%">
Mr. Pal is right in thinking that I expect a settlement by discussion
and compromise in matters not of vital intrest. But I did not discuss
the terms of settlement with the Viceroy. It is for the accredited
representatives of the people to do so. There is no fear, I assure
Mr. Pal, of my arriving at any settlement over the heads of the
people. Nor will there be any confidence when, if ever, the terms of
a settlement are discussed. Confidence there must be, when two
strangers meet for a friendly intercourse and wish to know each
other. We only met to know each other. I wish, however, at once to
ease the mind of the reader by telling him, that as an outcome of the
interview he need not expect any settlement at an early date, if only
because the people have not yet sufficiently prepared themselves for
it; and the Viceroy appears to me to be anxious to reconcile the
irreconcilable. He cannot pour new wines into old bottles. He cannot
keep  the Khilafat and the Punjab sores open, and still make India
happy and contented.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.19cm; line-height: 110%">
Mr. Pal is quite right when he says that, if the Punjab and the
Khilafat wrongs are redressed, I should leave it to the other leaders
to carry on the agitation about swaraj, for the simple reason that
when India has made her power sufficiently felt in connection with
the two great questions, she can have swaraj for the asking. Swaraj
is not for me something apart from the people’s power to right
every wrong, to prevent O’Dwyerism and Lloyd Georgism. The cult of
Sir Michael</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
O’Dwyer stands for terrorism, and that of Mr. Lloyd George for
treachery. When we have dealt with these two demons, I suggest to Mr.
Pal that we are ready to govern ourselves. If my followers in Bengal
do not resent my interview with the Viceroy, they know that for me
there is no settlement without a settlement of the two wrongs, they
know that time for discussing swaraj schemes will come only after the
two obstacles to any scheme of settlement are removed. Without their
removal, there is nothing for India save complete independence. the
Bengalis who attended the Barisal conference resented Mr. Pal’s
discussion because, as I apprehend, they considered it to be
premature and calculated to interfere with the evolution of the
proper swaraj spirit. Mr. Pal’s performance was like that of a
mason trying to tackle the topmost storey before the foundation was
solidly laid. I would humbly urge Mr. Pal not to land the country in
an untimely dis- cussion of swaraj schemes, and ask him to accept my
assurance, that so far as I am concerned, I would not do a single
thing about any swaraj scheme without an open consultation with the
representatives of the people. There is no question of consultation
about the Khilafat and the Punjab, because the minimum terms are
fairly well understood.</p>

Parsi gentleman said he wanted to know why they should confine their
energies to making khaddar only and not in making other things like
silk and other useful articles. In Japan, where he had been, the
cottagers did small articles in homes and made a profitable living
thereby. They also made the finest silk on handlooms. He asked
whether it was not possible to get their people to do that with the
help of societies and committees established in every town, who
should meet the losses and thus encourage rising industries.</font></font></p>

mulls, for which Dacca was famous, and fine silks. At the present
time, the unfortunate thing was that they had to import all fine yarn
for making finer kinds of cloth. It was only a question of time when
they would be able to manufacture finer counts of yarn and until then

Gandhi said the British had come to India only some 150 years ago and
before that the Parsis were living with Mohammedans and Hindus and
they should be able to judge for themselves whether they were better
or worse off. They were talking of Hindu-Muslim unity because there
was no such unity before and in that unity the unity of all other
smaller communities was also included, for instance, the Jews,
Christians, Parsis, etc. It did not mean that the other communities
were to be excluded from their friendship and that the Hindus and
Muslims alone were to be friends. The Parsis were ruling the Congress
for so many years and they had occupied very many important positions
in it. The Congress was looking after the rights of all the
communities equally and he did not think that, in the future, the
Parsis would be crushed between the two great communities—Hindus
and Muslims. If the Parsis thought that they would not benefit by
joining the non-co-operation movement, it was open to them to keep
themselves aloof from it. He asked them to join hands with them only
if they came to the conclusion that it would be to their good,
otherwise not.</font></font></p>

had been asked there. He said he would explain several points more

look after them, and that was the first principle of swaraj which
they had to keep in view. The majorities should not neglect the
interest of the minorities. Then one </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><i>Bohar

	I hear from Shri Vallabhbhai that the contribution  expected from
	the mills has not yet been received. How can we carry  on  national
	work in this way? Either this movement is good and should be
	supported, or it is bad and deserves to be smashed. But you merely
	let things take their time. Isn’t even Gujarat’s honour dear to
	the mill- owners? Should they not help Gujarat to raise its modest
	contribution without having to work hard for doing so? I hope you
	will permit no further delay. You may give anything you choose but I
	should like you to make a definite commitment. It will not matter if
	you do not give the whole sum in a lump, but the mills should credit
	the full amount to the Committee in their books, also provide that
	the interest on it will accrue to the Provincial [Congress]
	Committee. The Committee should also be entitled to issue cheques 
	whenever necessary. I certainly expect not less than five lakhs.
	Everywhere they ask me what the mills have done, the mills which
	have earned so much through the movement.</p>

controversy that has raged round it, it remains, an object-lesson in
the practice of non-co-operation. It is the one act which will stand
as a guiding-star to the straying non-co-operators.They must
continually purify themselves even in front of their opponents, and
at the risk of their action being mistaken for weakness. In the
process of putting themselves in the right, they must not count the
cost. That is the implication of following truth for truth’s sake.
The immediate prospect may appear ever so black, a seeker must
relentlessly pursue what he knows to be truth. The Prophet would have
lost his hold many  a time had he not thus treated truth as his
absolute and final sheet- anchor. Assuming that I gave my advice to
the Ali Brothers out of my strength, and they understood and accepted
it in their strength, the apology will be found to have done, as I

expression I betray so often. I am not by any means an indifferent

succeeded in leaving the impression in a critic’ in the <i>Servant
</i><i>of </i><i>India</i>, that I expect the Moderates to join he
non-co-operators in picketing. I do nothing of the kind. Picketing
might appear to the co- operators to be too clumsy and too incomplete
to commend itself to them. But I thought that they would help the
temperance cause <i>in </i><i>their </i><i>own way</i>, i.e., by
immediately abolishing the drink-shops. It is the least they owe to
the country. Daily, as the heat of the picketing is increasing, the
pickets come in for the attentions of the keepers of liquor shops and
of their customers. I understand that two pickets were struck by some
ruffians and had their heads broken in Ahmedabad. These brave men now
daily appear at their post with bandaged heads. A volunteer was
slapped in the presence of a crowd in Bombay, and he stood his ground
firmly but did not retaliate. Such instances must multiply, as the
effect of picketing is felt by the sellers of spirituous liquors. It
is impossible to stop this reform, even though pickets lose their
lives in the performance of their duty. The work</p>

ready to take up picketing, and so long as they are ready to risk
their lives without retaliating. It was because I was aware of the
danger that I appealed to the patriotism of the Moderates with a view
to abolishing at a stroke all drink-shops, and thus saving young men
and young women from injury to limb or life. It grieves me,
therefore, to find that I failed in my letter to carry the point
home. I am aware that, at some future date, temperance reform will

speciality with the Parsis, if indeed they will not care to join the
national service. They and the nation will be the better for the able
Parsi lawyers’ renunciation. No one, certainly no Parsi, is
expected to give up any lucrative calling not calculated to uphold
the prestige of this Government, and to take up spinning instead. But
every Parsi with leisure is expected to devote his or her leisure
hours to spinning for the sake of the nation. Thus, there is no
question of the Parsis giving up their soda. But those who take
intoxicating drinks will benefit themselves and the nation by total
abstinence. Parsis need not give up their present style of dress, so
long as the cloth is handspun and hand- woven. But they will lose
nothing by reverting to the  ancient simplicity of their
forefathers.The old Parsi dress was designed to fit the Indian
climate. The European style is ugly and utterly unsuitable for Indian
conditions. Only their insularity and unimaginativeness  have made
the English retain their English style in India, even though they
admit that it is most uncomfortable for this climate. I venture to
think that thoughtless imitation is no sign of progress. Nor is every
reversion to old habits tantamount to ‘setting back the hand of
time’. Retracing a hasty or erroneous step is surely a sign of
progress. And it is contended that during the past hundred years, we
have taken many a faulty step. Before, therefore, we can move
forward, we must go many steps back to find ourselves on the right
track. We lost the way, and I invite ‘Observer’ and all other
Parsis to hasten back to the point where we strayed from the right
path.</p>

As I have already said, unfortunately the races and gambling in
connection therewith are fashionable. They do not excite the same
feeling of shame that drinking does. Race-going, therefore, is more
difficult to deal with than drinking. Satya’ knows the evils of
race- going in a special manner. I invite him to come out in the open
and personally tackle the vice which is slowly but surely undermining
the morals of society.</p>

Truly to revere the memory of a person is to achieve his life’s
purpose. Truly to revere the memory of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, whom
India delighted and still delights to call Lokamanya, must be to
establish swaraj, and thus for ever to perpetuate his memory. How
fine, how noble, if we could establish swaraj on the anniversary of
his death? Nor is it impossible to do so during the forty days that
remain at our disposal. But my sanguine temperament cannot, visualize
swaraj by the the first of August next. By strenuous work, it is
certainly possible to establish swaraj on the first day of October
next. It must be death to the Congress, if swaraj cannot be
established on or before the 31st December next. But it cannot be, if
we do not carry out our Bezwada undertaking to raise one crore of
rupees. These lines will be published on the 22nd instant. The reader
has therefore to think how to complete the crore in eight days.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Let us know how we stand. If all goes well, it may safely be assumed
that forty lakhs will have been collected by that date outside
Bombay. That menas, let me further state, at least three lakhs  in
Bengal, four in the Punjab, three in Sind, three in Andhra, three in
the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; line-height: 102%">
C. P., four in Bihar and ten in Gujarat. That makes thirty lakhs. Ten
lakhs for the remaining provinces is not an extravagant estimate. Let
us assume that all the Provinces but Bombay succeed in collecting all</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 5%"><br/>

<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
together forty lakhs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
How to collect sixty lakhs in and through Bombay, that is the
question. If we are to reach the total of one crore before the 30th
June, the amount must be raised chiefly from the available rich men
of Bombay and Calcutta, i.e., those who feel for the movement and
believe in it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
There should be not only only no bother about collecting the crore,
but there should be certainty of swaraj in a month, if all the rich
men of India could realize that their safety lies, not in fearing the
existing Government, but in fearlessly helping the movement. Today,
if they are making millions, they are sending billions out of the
country, i.e., they are taking the millions and assisting to take the
billions out of the mouths of thier poor and, in many cases, starving
countrymen. Today, they, more than the other classes, are supporting
a top-heavy administration, which is keeping up a ruinous military
expenditure in order to be able to hold India in the last resort by
Dyerism and O’Dwyerism.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But we must take the facts as they are. The richest men are afraid to
incur the displeasure of Collectors and Commissioners. Some of them
honestly fear the success of non-co-operation. They believe that its
success means chaos and destruction of life and property at least for
the time being. We must win these over by patiently persever- ing to
impregnate the atmosphere with the spirit of non-violence in thought,
word and deed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Meanwhile, let us realize that the few rich men and the many
well-to-do men and women we have with us have to sacrifice more than
they are ordinarily used to, if we are to make up the deficiency. A
happy beginning has already been made in Bombay. Earnest wor- kers,
themselves endowed with riches, are working night and day to make
large collections. They are meeting with ups and downs. But they are
dauntlessly pursuing their even course.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
We must get rid of the habit of waiting to be coaxed. Why should not
the moneyed men of Bombay volunteer their assistance and send their
gifts? Why should they wait till some one else has begun?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
And what of those who cannot give lakhs or thousands each? They can
still do much to reduce the burden of the few rich. Let them not wait
for a summons from any society. Let each group, each caste, each
trade-guild automatically set about collecting and sending to the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.65cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
provincial centres. The remaining days must be utilized for that
purpose and no other by those who have any ability for collection.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
It is a shame that the total possible collection of the provinces
cannot be more than forty lakhs. There is still time to wipe out the
reproach, by each province producing selfless workers for the Week of
Grace and Privilege, who would concentrate their energies on
collections.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
Seeing that so many of the moneyed men are abstaining, and seeing
that we have not succeeded in organizing collections among the
masses, it follows that some must give their all. I know four
Gujaratis, themselves workers of standing and ability, who have given
their all. One has died, leaving over Rs. 25,000, the whole of his
sav- ings, to the Swaraj Fund. I hope the example of the four workers
will prove infectious. One loses nothing by giving in  the  cause  of
freedom.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
If we are to achieve swaraj during this year, the least we can do is
to complete the Bezwada programme by the time fixed. The collection
of the crore will be a most visible token of its fulfilment.</p>

Membership and the charkha are no less important. I suggest two
meetings, one on Sunday the 26th and the other on the 30th June at
every possible village or centre, merely for the purpose of
explaining the Congress creed, and inviting all of the age of twenty-
one and over, men and women, to become members of any one original
Congress Committee. At these meetings, no  other  work  should be
done save that of enrolling members and collecting sub- scriptions
for membership. Forms can also be deposited during these days at all
places where responsible men will undertake the work of canvassing.</p>

received, the spinning-wheel has so far penetrated the masses that it
is likely that there are already twenty lakhs of spinning-wheels

I have received Dr. John Pollen’s open letter. I do not print it
here, as it has already appeared in the Press. It is quite like him.
He has hardly taken the trouble of studying the non-co-operation
movement. Yet he has seen no harm in condemning what he does not
know. He asks me to rely upon his own <i>ipse dixit </i>in preference
to my own experience. The pity of it is that Dr. Pollen’s letter
represents the average English attitude—laziness to study the other
side, and arrogation of omniscience and consequent self-satisfaction.
With a people so constituted, either non-co-operation or violence is
the only thing that answers. If you murder, they are shocked into
action; if you cease to speak to them, they are moved to inquire. The
shock  produced by murder provokes action, but rarely enlightenment.
It creates bad blood, not excluding terrorism. The relief is partial
and often proves more dangerous than the disease itself. Whereas the 
refusal to speak, to participate in the evil, to assist one’s own
degradation, to co-operate with the wrongdoer, gives strength to
oneself, and awakens and purifies the wrongdoer. India, I hope, has
chosen the better way for all time. Dr. Pollen is too lazy to see
that non-co-operation, being an insurance against violence,
necessarily involves the possibility of violence. It is an attempt to
supplant violence. The least that non-co-operation has done is to
postpone violence, and if it is tried long enough, it will give such
strength to the people as would enable them to see that violence is
totally unnece- ssary. Non-co-operation is a spetic treatment. It
heals without killing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
Dr. Pollen should have known that I remain just as opposed to boycott
of <i>British </i><i>goods </i>as ever. I have always advocated, as I
 advocate today, boycott of <i>all </i><i>foreign </i><i>cloth for
all time</i>, and boycott of such other foreign goods as India can
profitably manufacture. The swadeshi that I have conceived excludes
the idea of punishment or revenge. It means self-help and recognition
of the natural law that the best service to humanity is to help that
part of it which is nearest to you. An India self-dependent will help
the whole world, an India helpless and clothed by Manchester and
Japan harms both herself and the latter.</p>

Let me further inform Dr. Pollen that, whilst I am a determined enemy
of the system of government, to which in my ignorance I was once
friendly, I still count myself a friend of the British people. My
religion forbids me to have friends and foes. I therefore assure him
that I shall for ever be actuated by the same feelings towards the
British people as towards brothers, and am now acting towards them as
I have acted towards my blood-brothers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I must adhere to the adjectives I have felt it my duty to use
regarding the system, and my business is, whilst calling an evil
thing evil, to restrain an outburst of evil passions against
wrongdoers. It would be foolish to ignore or hide a disease for fear
of the patient running amok in panic. He must be warned of the
disease, and provided with a tolerably safe remedy.</p>

Not only does Dr. Pollen deny these truths known to us all, but he
asserts that the administration is cheaper than  elsewhere,  and

Dr. Pollen asserts that India is ‘really a  marvellously  rich
country inhabited for the most part by a comparatively poor and

of five will suffice for its support. I suggest to him that Rs. 2-4-0

the poor, and that I should still further reduce the average for the
masses of poor men, because it is reached by including the millions

 Bull’s’  letter   shows  that   the   writer   has   attempted
to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
understand the movement. Much of his criticism is not wholly
undeserved. ‘John Bull’ has given the experience of the average
Englishman. His generalizations, in my opinion, cannot be sustained.
His experience is confined to a microscopic minority of Indians,
drawn to the cantonments from ambitious motives, and by no means
representing the mass of the people. In my opinion, based upon an
extensive experience of both the races, man for man the Indian is in
no way inferior, in all that matters, to any other race in the world.
That as animals we are inferior to Englishmen must be admitted. But
that is due more largely to the climate than to anything else. The
charge of indifference to the welfare of our animals can also, I
think, be easily sustained. I do not believe that, except in large
towns, WE suffer more from venereal diseases than the other races.
Dedication of girls to prostitution is certainly a serious blot on
our culture. If Indians were trained in the same manner as
Englishmen, and if India was similarly situated as England, she would
give quite a good account of herself. But we have a different culture
which, I hope, we will retain to the end of time. India’s
temperament is not warlike. She would refuse to see any greatness in
sending her millions to the trenches for the purpose of killing
fellow-men, even though the latter might be in error. India including
her Mussulman population, is in my opinion more fitted for
self-suffering than for inflicting suffering upon others. It is in
this belief that I have ventured to offer to her non-co-operation as
a remedy for her many ills. Whether she will really respond or not
remains to be seen. If it has been taken up purely from revengeful
motives, it will fail. If it has been taken up, as I believe it has
been, for the purpose of self-purification and self-sacrifice, it is
bound to succeed. That Indians are not a nation of cowards is proved
by the personal bravery and daring of her martial races, whether
Hindu, Mussul-man, Sikh or Gurkha. My point is that the spirit of
fighting is</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
foreign to India’s soil, and that probably she has a higher part to
play in the evolution of the world. Time alone can show what is to be
her destiny.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
But ‘John Bull’ is entitled to treat all I have said in answer as
so much special pleading. I would far rather that we took such
criticism as a friendly warning, and that we began to rid ourselves
of all our impurities. I agree with ‘John Bull’ that it is better
to command respect than to grumble about the want of it. And that is
exactly the reason why India has taken up non-co-operation. The
writer does not like the word. I would reject it today if I could
find a better. But it is the only word that meets the case. We have
co-operated long enough in our own degradation. It is our duty to
refuse to do so any longer. One need not even apportion the blame.
The fact stands, as ‘Jonh Bull’ has properly admitted, that the
average Englishman has little respect for us. We must therefore stand
aside till we and they <i>feel </i>as equals.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
But there is the other side to ‘John Bull’s’ argument. His 
attitude betrays race-repugnance. Assuming the shortcomings to exist,
just as they are described by the writer, is that a reason for
looking down upon Indians as inferior beings? Or, does not the
doctrine of equality require mutual regard, irrespective of the
possession of the same qualities? Does not ‘John Bull’ commit the
same error  that many Hidnus do regarding the ‘untouchables’? If
I am right in  calling the spirit of untouchability Satanic, am I
less right in calling the cult of English superiority also by the
same name? Do  Englishmen behave towards their less fortunate
brethren in the same way as they behave towards Indians? Do they not
consider themselves to be born to rule, and Indians born to obey,
even as Hinduism is said to have consigned the ‘untouchables’ to
perpetual subjection? My whole soul has risen against the existing
system of Government, because I believe that there is no real freedom
for India under the British connection if Englishmen cannot give up
the fetish of their predestined superiority. This attitude of
Englishmen has deprived the tallest Indian of any chance of rising to
his full height and, therefore, in spite of all the good intentions
of individual English administrators, we have really lost in our own
estimation, so much so that many of us have come to believe that we
require a long course of training under the English, whereas it is my
conviction that we are today quite fit to govern ourselves, and
therefore we must resolutely refuse to co- operate with them in the
administration of reforms that fall short of</p>

	I have often thought of writing about H.E.’s speech and the
	<i>communique </i>about the Ali Brothers. But I have purposely
	delayed writing in order that I may not take a hasty step or write a
	thoughtless word. I want to tell H.E. that I was deeply grieved over
	the <i>commun- ique </i>and the speech. In my opinion neither
	represents a correct statement of the situation as I understood it
	when I left Simla. I am deluged with the inquiries about the
	interviews. I suggest that either an agreed statement giving the
	purport of the interviews should be published or I should be
	absolved from the obligation to observe confidence regarding the
	interviews. I need hardly say that so far as I am concerned I have
	no desire to treat anything I have said to H.E. as confidential.</p>

Someone said that you should perform purificatory rites. But there

regarded as an untouchable for that reason, though even so you must
give up these things. I would not visit a Brahmin if he drinks or

I do not know of any great sacrifice made by Gujarat for a public
cause. I do not regard the sacrifice made at the time of the Broach
Conference as a sacrifice by Gujarat. It was merely a sacrifice made
in Gujarat. We can speak of sacrifice by Gujarat only when a large
number of Gujarati men and women give up their all for the cause for
the country.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Nevertheless, we shall never know to what extent the spirit of
self-sacrifice shown by the friends who resolved, during the con-
ference at Broach, to offer their all will have helped Gujarat to
fulfil its pledge. But a person like me, who has faith, will, if
Gujarat passes the test on June 30, believe that the chief reason for
this was the sacrifice made at Broach.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
However that be, if Gujarat wishes to make a supreme effort to win
swaraj this very year, it urgently needs voluntary workers who will
dedicate their all to the cause. Look at any other province in the
country, and we shall find that till now Gujarat has made fewer
sacrifices than it. Maharashtra stands at the top. I would describe
Bengal’s sacrifices as reckless, but it has certainly not shrunk
from any. In the Punjab, too, the people’s sacrifice has been of no
order. The very conception of the Arya Samaj has been inspired by a
spirit of self-denial. The Sikhs’ sacri-fices have also been no
less.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
We cannot claim say such thing for Gujarat. When two young men from
Gujarat joined the Servants of India Society, the people were filled
with surprise. We took it to be a great act of self-sacrifice when
two gentlemen from Surat gave up working for earning money and
started running Ashrams. When I spoke of this sacrifice to a
professor in the Punjab, he merely smiled and said: “I don’t call
it a sacrifice at all. Have they given up their all? What hardships
do they bear? Do they have to worry for their meals the next day?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Many years have passed since this conversation and, meanwhile, the
professor has even been on a pilgrimage to jail. He didn’t have a
farthing with him.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Gujarat can hold its head high only when a large number of young men
come forward to sacrifice their all; only then will it be fit to make
its contribution to the cause of swaraj. It is the duty of each and
every province to do all it can for winning swaraj. Every province
will be equally disgraced if we fail in securing swaraj before the
end of this year. No province can blame another. The province which
first</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
acquires comp-lete fitness for swaraj will win it for itself and will
instantaneously make others ready for it. Winning swaraj means
helping the country to over-come its lack of faith in itself and to
inspire self-confidence in it. From among some lions which believe
themselves to be lambs, if even one re-alizes the truth about itself,
very soon the others will also know themsel-ves to be lions. If even
one province demonstrates the complete success of non-co-operation,
other provinces will not be slow in following. One may also be sure
that the solutions of the Punjab and the Khilafat proble-ms will
follow as a matter of course as soon as even one person has ac-quired
the necessary strength. I shall explain some other time in what that 
strength consists. At the moment, I only want to suggest that, even
in working to acquire the needed strength for non-co-operation, large
numb-ers of young men and women will have to make the heaviest
sacrifices.</p>

If a man offers up his all, how is he to maintain himself? It is
cer-tainly better to give up the idea of service and follow some
avocation to maintain oneself and one’s family than to live on alms
and serve [the country]. The fear expressed in the foregoing question
is certainly justi-fied if the idea is that one should live on alms
so that one may be free to serve others. But every worker is entitled
to what his labour is worth. The kind of service I have in view is
not one of leading others, but one which consists in labouring for
them. He is the true volunteer who works harder, is more honest, more
efficient, more humble and has a better sense of discipline than a
paid employee. Such a voluntary worker is paid just enough for
living. He does not, thus, live upon alms, but gives true service to
the country. He gives more than he receives. The man who reserves
something for himself and then claims to give his free services to
the country is less worthy than another who has offered up his all.
If the common experience is different from this, it means that in
actual fact the worker giving up his all has been stealing. That is,
he has given away all his wealth but not his mind and his body. Not
only that; claiming to give his all, he takes more than he has given.
If, after giving away the lakh of rupees which I had, I in-volve the
country in an expenditure of lakhs and refuse to give all of my time
and myself to work, I shall have certainly become a beggar living on
alms, nay, more despicable even than a beggar. It is not of sacrifice
like this that I have been speaking. The sacrifice which I call for
has simply no room in it for behaving like a beggar. Do what one
will, such sacrifice cannot be hidden from</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
others. So long as this state of things does not exist in the
country, it is vain to think of having swaraj. A swaraj army will
come into existence only when some men and women are ready to
sacrifice their all; only then will many others come forward to make
ordinary sacrifices, and their sacrifices will be to good effect.</p>

The time has come for such sacrifices. The [Gujarat] Provincial
Congress Committee has issued an appeal for  volunteers.  In-
competent persons and those who do not know what vocation to take up
may offer themselves, if they wish to, but the applicants I am
looking for are such as will be prepared to give up their all, live
on what the country can give them and feel honoured in doing so. We
shall never win this great war for a holy cause with the help of
those who offer themselves as swaraj workers because they can think
of nothing else to do. I hope, therefore, that the sacrifice which
the  friends have made [at Broach] will infect others and I shall
have the good fortune to speak of Gujarat’s sacrifice as distinct
from sacrifice made in Gujarat.</p>

Madhuri and Pushpa are girls of six or seven. It was my greedy hunt

While I sat surrounded by the men and women members of the family,
all full of love for me, Madhuri came up, walking with slow, hesitant
steps. I called her to me. Unfortunately, they had given me a chair,
tables and chairs being the normal thing in the family. Seated in a

head on my lap.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.44cm">“I

“What should kids have to do with ornaments? We appear handsome

to help some good cause. And you seem to be a good girl! You confess
your error too. You should willingly give your orna- ments. I shall
utilize them to supply spinning-wheels to the homes of the poor, and

There were two little ruby pendants on Madhuri’s ears and on her
wrists a pair of bangles with strips of gold and another pair of
glass bangles. She whispered :</p>

“I can get money even for your bangles. But I want all your

She ran away, returning in a minute. While she was removing the
pendants, I said : “But have you obtained mother’s permission?”</p>

<p align="RIGHT" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 105%">
Do what I might, though, I could not overcome my greed. My eyes would
not turn away from the bangles. I did not yet know the girl’s name,
nor whose daughter she was. I now asked and learnt her name,
recognized the worthy gentleman who was her father, and said :
“Really, Madhuri, what do you see in these bangles that you</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 102%">love them so much? What
should an innocent girl like you do with ornaments? Won’t you give
your bangles too?”</p>

Madhuri softened. With her own hands, she removed a bangle and put it
into my hand. This was a victory for me, I thought.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
But the victory was on Madhuri’s side. That little girl had stolen
my heart. I envied her parents. “May all parents have such
children,” I prayed from my heart. My faith in the success of our
struggle for swaraj grew stronger. I said to Madhuri :</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
“You have been so wonderful. I will not accept the other bangle
even if you give it. But is it willingly that you have given me what
you have? You can take them back, if you wish to.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">As
I said this, I held out the ornaments before her.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 1.54cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">

As the end of June approaches, my eyes turn more often to Kathiawar.
At the moment, I propose to discuss where  Kathiawar stands with
regard to contributions. I intend to deal with other matters later.</p>

The work for swaraj concerns the whole of India. Indian States stand
to gain in no small way through swaraj. Rulers of Indian States know
that the swaraj movement has increased their strength and the
subjects know that it has increased theirs.</p>

This movement is not for the liquidation of kingship, pwoer or
wealth, but for their purification. To the degree that duplicity
disappears from us, to that degree will the swaraj barometer register

irreligion.</p>

What will be the contribution of the Princes in Kathiawar, and their
subjects, to this movement? So far there has been none. If it wills,
Kathiawar can raise the balance necessary to complete the figure of
one crore. The enterprising people of Kathiawar have gone to a great
many places for business. They are certainly contributing to the
local funds wherever they reside. I should like them to give more
than they do. But, then, these are their contributions as Indians. As
Kathiawari Gujaratis, however, what will they send from Kathiawar?
What will they contribute towards Gujarat’s quota of 10 lakhs? Or,
rather, cannot they exert themselves and raise Gujarat’s quota to
double that figure?</p>

The <i>Memons </i>of Porbandar, Ranavav, Kutiana, Jetpur and Dhoraji

inclined.</p>

Those who do not believe that India is suffering from tuberculosis or

India of the disease, certainly need not contribute anything. I have

The people of Wadhwan and Viramgam raised my hopes. Zalawad has had
an ill-name on account of its poverty and narrow- mindedness. That
same Zalawad has given me a surprise. If Zalawad by itself can
contribute more than Rs. 25,000, what must Halar and Sorath and
Gohilwad give? And what Bhavnagar? The last is, at present, the
biggest port in Kathiawar, with a thriving business. The people are
relatively well off. Where is the share it ought to have contributed?</p>

The women of Zalawad, I must admit, disappointed me. I saw a good
number of them [at the meeting]. But I was pained to find that the
contribution by the women who attended the two meetings at Wadhwan
was the lowest I had known at any place in the whole of India. Could
it be that they had not heard about swaraj, about <i>dharmarajya</i>?
Or did the fault the lie with the men? Was it that they had done
nothing to educate the women about this holy cause? Let the reason be
what it is. I for one have great hopes of my sisters in Kathiawar.
They have taken well to the spinning-wheel. Hundreds of poor women
among them are earning their livelihood through it and serving Mother
India at the same time. Will not the well-to-do women give their
jewellery or contribute in cash?</p>

Kathiawaris claim me as one of themselves. That love of theirs will
now be tested. If, despite their love for me, I fail in convincing
them, how can I ever hope to win over other Indians? If Kathiawar has
understood my message, I shall certainly expect its contribution to
be the biggest.</p>

The Viceroy’s reply to the Ahmadiyya community shows that he has
passed into the hands of a bureaucracy that is clever, united and
utterly unscrupulous.His defence of officers and officials supplies
the meaning of racial equality. The Viceroy sees no inequality in the
impunity with which Europeans may commit crimes against Indian
humanity. I recall the extraordinary judgment of a Punjab magistrate,
who considers that justice is satisfied when he draws upon his
imagination for extenuating causes, and fines a young Irish soldier
fifty rupees for interfering with the liberty of an innocent Indian
woman.</p>

His Excellency does not care to study the daily Press which is
replete with instances of insults hurled against Indians by
Europeans. He seems to be unaware of the fact that British officers 
will  not  tolerate the presence of Indian judges in their railway
compartment. The Viceroy says : There is no foundation, I verily
believe, for any suggestion that the British official is anxious to
assert racial superi- ority over the Indian with whom he comes in
contact.’ I assure Lord Reading that his observation is so contrary
to the everyday experience of the average Indian that it must
prejudice the people against the soundness of his judgment or even
the honesty of his purpose. They will see in his certificates of
character to officials and officers  a  studied refusal to see the
truth and do justice. They will not give him the benefit of the doubt
and think, as I do, that the Viceroy is not wilfully blind but is not
permitted to see things, except so much as the</p>

The fact is that it is impossible for any Viceroy to see the truth,
living as he does on the mountain-tops seven months in the year, and
in complete isolation even when he lives on the plains. Imagine a
business man in Bombay conducting his business from top-floor, with
only lifts and ’phones between him and his clerks and salesmen. The
people of Bombay are hardly satisfied with the condition wherein at
least there is an unbroken chain of inhabited floors between the top
and the ground floors. But with the big business house in Simla and
the groaning millions on the plains, there is solid, dead rock, and
even the piercing cry of the feeble millions is broken into
nothingness, as it heaves up to the mountain-top from the plains.
Prince Siddhartha was kept in such isolation that he did not know
what misery, want and death were. He was an honest lad. But for an
accident, he would have been lost to the world. Well, he was living
not much above his people. He had the same coloured pigment as his
father’s subjects. Whilst Siddhartha was living hardly thirty feet
above the people, the Viceroy lives seven thousand five hundred feet<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>above them. It would be no fault in him, if he did not
willingly cut himself from the people, that he could not understand
the people’s hopes and fears. So long as he lives both physically
and mentally in Simla, so long will he be kept in ignorance of the
truth, even as Siddhartha was. But there is an accident in store for
him, as there was for the renowned young prince, whom the world
worships as Buddha the enlightened. Non-co-operation is the accident.
And if Lord Reading has open eyes and open ears, it will not be long
before he sees and hears the truth.</p>

‘Ditcher’ of the <i>Capital </i>has thrown mud at these brave
brothers. He has charged one of them with having, during 
imprisonment, abused the wireless and plotted with the enemy. He has
entered into details, as if the writer had been officially prompted
to write the paragraph. If the charge is true, the Government should
publish the facts. As it is, it stands, and must have discredited the
brothers in the eyes of the public. They are, I understand,  not

There are still people, even in advanced circles, who doubt the
efficacy of imprisonment for securing India’s freedom. They think
that imprisonment deprives the people of the services of brave men.
It is as much as to say that the bravest soldiers should not run any
risk for fear of their guidance being lost to the cause they espouse.
Such sceptics forget that the Lokamanya owed his immense popularity
and influence to his having suffered imprisonment.Jesus’s death on
Calvary was his crowing achievement. The passion of Imam Hasan on the
field of Karbala made Islam a power in the world. Harishchandra is
remembered for his endless sufferings. India cannot attain freedom
until lakhs upon lakhs have become fearless and are ready to seek
imprisonment in their innocence. And if lakhs are  not  ready,
thousands must be actually imprisoned before India attains freedom.
Non-co-operation is intended to evoke the truest  bravery  of the
nation. We must be prepared to defy sufferings even unto death if we
will be free. He who saves himself shall perish.</p>

legitimately opposing the will of this Government, it follows that we
cannot defend ourselves before a British court of law, much less can
we engage counsel. I know, it is possible to imagine hard cases as,
say, of the Savarkar brothers. If I knew them to be convinced non-co-

action for damages against their persecutors, even though they may be

more to the resolution of the boycott of British courts, it will be

Nothing has caused so much waste of time as the Simla interview and
the Apology. From among the many letters before me, I wish to deal  
with  only   one.   A   respected   friend<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  who   is  jealous   of   my reputation for honesty
and fairplay, tells me that the talk in Simla is, that I have been
unfair to the Viceroy, that I have almost accused him of breach of
honour and that I have possibly and unconsciously swerved from the
truth in saying that the apology is not made to the Government. I
still hold that the apology was not tendered to the Government. If it
was, I would not have hesitated to make it clear in the wording
itself. It was meant not to be ambiguous. There was no occasion for
concealing anything for saving the face of the Ali Brothers. I hasten
to assure everyone, not excluding His Excellency, that if I find that
I have strayed from truth by a hair’s breadth, I shall apologize to
him and to the world. I hold truth above my in-fluence in my country
or anywhere else. I am not conscious  of  having accused Lord Reading
of breach of honour. A rapid conver-sation is a mental cinematograph.
The mind takes in the word-pictures as fast as they come, but it does
not retain them all fully or in their exact order in memory. It is
possible that we both have carried different impressions of the
various interviews. I have given mine with the utmost accuracy, and
as much as I could, without being guilty of a breach of confidence.
But I see quite clearly that the public is befogged. It will not be
satisfied without a fairly full report of the interviews. I am
anxious to satisfy its curiosity. To that end I have already entered
into correspondence with H. E. the  Viceroy,  and asked that either
an agreed version may be published, or I may be absolved from the
promise of confidence. So far as I am concerned, I</p>

position of a Viceroy is totally different from that of a public
worker like myself. I must ask those who are eager to know the whole
story to be  a little patient. Meanwhile, I wish to acknowledge one
serious mistake, I see, I have made. I ought to have asked to be
shown the <i>commun- </i><i>ique </i>that was to be issued. I was
anxious not to go back to Simla and further interrupt my tour, and I
was so certain that everything would pass off nicely and creditably
to both parties. With all experience of honest misunderstandings and
worse, I should have done better. But that was not to be. I am,
however, quite certain that although it is unfortunate that a great
deal of bitterness has been generated by the controversy, the
country’s cause will be found to have gained rather than suffered.
Meanwhile, I must accept the verdict of the good Maulana Abdul Bari
that the harm in the shape of the drooping of the spirits of
non-co-operators is apparent, the gain is in the womb of the future.

Mr. Godrej of the safe fame has eclipsed all donations to the Tilak
Swaraj Fund with his announcement of three lakhs of rupees. His
dona-tions to public purposes have been hitherto quite unknown. But
he was induced to appreciate the necessity this time of a public
announcement.I tender my congratulations to Mr. Godrej and the whole
Parsi community. I wish also to testify that,  during  the collection
week in Bombay, not a day has passed without Parsi donations. Parsi
ladies and gentlemen are also making door to door collections. Parsis
are also working as pickets. Among the  news- papers, too, not all
the Parsi papers are hostile to the movement. But Mr. Godrej’s
generosity puts the Parsis easily first in all India. Parsi
Rustomji’s [Rs.] 52,000 would in any case have put the Parsis in a
respectable position. Mr. Godrej has secured the first place.</p>

The liquor-shop picketing has an intimate relation to Parsis. We will
have to exercise great forbearance towards our Parsi countrymen.
While we cannot stop picketing altogether, we must meet the liquor-
dealers in conference, understand their difficulties and explain our
own. Mr. Godrej has earmarked his donation for liquor prohibition and
the uplift of the suppressed classes. Let us not, therefore, think
that all Parsis are necessarily hostile to the great temperance
movement. At the present moment, an outbreak of violence is most to</p>

take their courage in both hands, refund all auction bids and close
liquor-shops. I assure them that the movement can only be regulated,
it cannot be checked. The people are bent on ending liquor-shops, and
treating as a crime all liquor-selling except as a medicine by
chemists. It is a matter that brooks no delay.</p>

The election naturally took place by propor-tional representation. I
would not have troubled the reader with the names but for the lesson
the election carries with it. The reader will observe that there are
three Mussulmans elected and they are first on the list, showing that
the electors were determined to ensure their election. Numerically,
not more than two need have been elected, but the electors wisely
decided to elect all the Mussulman candidates. They next wanted to
ensure the election of at least one lady, and so Shrimati Anasuyabai
comes next. The most noteworthy feature of the election, however, is
that, whilst all good workers have been elected, many equally good
and able workers have simply stood aside. They did not stand for
election. I commend this spirit of self-effacement to all whom it may
concern. There should be no rivalry among workers for offices of
honour. All must aim at becoming the most efficient workers. But all
cannot possibly be elected to offices of honour, if they also carry
heavy responsibility with it. The best way is for everyone to be
ready to stand aside, and let the others be elected. Thus is it
possible to avoid bitterness, unhealthy rivalry and heart-burnings.
The best service is certainly possible, even though one may never
hold any office. Indeed, the best workers all the world over are
generally the most silent.</p>

Several complaints have been received regarding the advisory
resolution of the Working Committee about the Lucknow compact. The
only section of the new Constitution bearing on Muslim representation
is the one regarding the rights of minorities. As it was brought to
the notice of the Working Committee that Mussulmans were getting
nervous about their representation and desired obser- vance of the
Lucknow compact in the Congress, it was thought advisable to give the
guidance in that direction. Attempts are certainly being made to
divide us. Mussulmans have only now begum to come in. And it is the
duty of the Hindus to hold out every lawful inducement to them to
join the Congress. It must be the common meeting ground for all races
and religions. Where Mussulmans do not come forward at all in spite
of entreaty, the seats can be left vacant for want of candidates, or
filled in by others pending the appearance of suitable Muslim
candidates. Some friends urge that we should just now think not of
special claims, but only of efficiency. Efficiency is</p>

Apropos of Hindu-Muslim unity, I would once more revert to
cow-protection. No Hindu has this more at heart than I have, but I
refuse to be impatient. We will never succeed in stampeding our
Mussulman countrymen into stopping cow-slaughter. They cannot  feel
for the cow in the same sense and measure as we Hindus do. We can
only put them on their honour by being honourable ourselves. Bihar
still continues to be the storm centre. I would urge both Hindu and
Mussulman leaders to take time by the forelock and nip the evil in
the bud. Nor must the Hindus of Bihar mix up vegetarianism with
cow-killing. The two stand on a different footing. Cow-protection is
the creed of twenty million Hindus, vegetarianism is confined to a
small minority. The latter cannot be permitted to force its views
upon others.</p>

has to evolve a programme that would ensure the esta- blishment of

If we mean really well by our Mussulman brethren, we must sympathize
with them over the movement going on in Europe to destroy Turkish
nationalism. It is a thousand pities that the British Government is
secretly or openly leading the movement. Let Hindus not be frigtened
by Pan-Islamism. It is not—it need not be—anti- Indian or
anti-Hindu. Mussulmans must wish well to every Mussul- man state, and
even assist any such state, if it is undeservedly in peril. And
Hindus, if they are true friends of Mussulmans, cannot but share the
latter’s feelings. We must therefore co-operate with our Mussul-
man brethren in their attempt to save the Turkish Empire in Europe
from extinction.</p>

Hindus may not then be agitated when Mussulmans become alarm-ed at
the slightest hint that the British  Government  might openly join
the Greeks against the Turkish Government in Angora. If Britain

England has her choice. She can no longer hold the awakened Hindus
and Mussulmans as slaves. If India is to remain equal partner with
every other member of the Empire, India’s voting strength must be
infinitely superior to that of any other member. In a free
commonwealth, every partner has as much right to retire if the rest
go wrong, as it is his duty to remain so long as the rest are
faithful to certain common principles. If India votes wrong, England
can retire from partnership, as every other partner can. Thus, the
centre of equilibrium must shift to India rather than to England,
when India has come into her own. That is my meaning of swaraj within
the Empire. Brute force must be ruled out of account in all
deliberations. Reference must be had always to reason and never to
the sword.</p>

And as with England, so with India. The latter, too, has her choice.

destroy Turkey, India’s only choice must be independence. For
Mussulmans, when Turkey’s existence, such as it is, is threatened,
there is no looking back. They would draw the sword if they could,
and perish or rise victorious with the brave Turks. But if, as is
certain, thanks to the policy of the Government of India, they cannot
declare war against the British Government, they can at least
forswear allegiance to a Govern-ment which wickedly goes to war
against Turkey. The duty of the Hindus is no less clear. If we still
fear and distrust the Mussulmans, we must side with the British and
prolong our slavery. If we are brave and religi-ous enough not to
fear the Mussulmans, our countrymen, and if we have the wisdom to
trust them, we must make common cause with the Muss-ulmans in every
peaceful and truthful method to secure Indian indepen-dence. For a
Hindu, as I conceive Hinduism to be, whether for indepen-dence or for
swaraj within the Empire, there is no road but non-violent non-co-
operation. India can have dominion or independent status today if
India learns and assimilates the secret and the invincible power of
non-violence. When she has learnt that lesson, she is ready to take
up all the stages of non-co-operation including non-payment of taxes.
India is not ready today, but if we would be prepared to frustrate
every plot that may be hatched for the destruction of Turkey or for
prolonging our subjection, we must secure an atmosphere of
enlightened non-violence as fast as pos-sible, not the non-violence
of the weak but the non-violence of the strong, who would disdain to
kill but would gladly die for the vindication of truth.</p>

The resolutions of the Working Committee have come in for some

devised as to tax and prove the nation’s capacity for
self-government. It undoubtedly sets up a system of voluntary
government, in which the only force available is public opinion and
the goodwill of the people. And seeing that the Congress is today
engaged in opposing and, if need be, destroying the existing system,
it follows that the greater the authority of the Congress, the less
must be that of the Government. When the Con-gress commands complete
confidence and <i>willing </i><i>obedience </i>to its instructions,
there is full swaraj. For, then the Government must respect popular
opinion ex-pressed through the Congress, or it must commit suicide.
The Con-gress must, therefore, become the most united, the strongest
in charac-ter and the largest organization in the land. The Congress
policy, therefore, must command the readiest acceptance.</p>

The Congress meets in session only once a year. It lays down
poli-cies. The All-India Congress Committee is designed to carry out
the Con-gress policy as embodied in its resolutions. It must
interpret all resolu-tions, and attend to all new matters, with the
same authority as the Con-gress. The members may debate upon
different propositions and inter-pretations as much as they choose,
but except on matters of vital prin-ciple, the dissenters must
conform to, and faithfully carry out, the reso-lutions of the
majority. The discussions in the Committee are not open for
re-discussion in public. In order to make the All-India Congress
Com-mittee an efficient body, the Con- stitution has provided for a
Working Committee of fifteen, which must meet often and must be able
to deal with all the matters delegated to it by the All-India
Congress Committee. It is designed to exercise all the functions of
the All-India Congress Committee when the latter is not sitting. It
must watch and guide public opinion, it must interpret it, it must
keep all the subsidiary organizations in working order, it must
attend to all-India finance, it must distribute it, and whenever
decision on matters of grave importance has to be taken, it must
summon a meeting of the All-India Congress Committee for direc-tion.
The Working Committee is to the Congress what a Cabinet is to a
Parliament. Its decisions must command respect if we are to evolve
con-stitutional government during this year. Naturally, therefore,
its members must be those who command the greatest respect of the
All- India Con-gress Committee and of the nation. It dare not take
any hasty decisions, and it must be a homogeneous body. It cannot
have two policies or two parties within itself. Whilst the Congress
represents the whole nation, and may, therefore, have every type and
all parties,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="160. THE MESSAGE OF THE CHARKHA"></a>
the Working Committee must consist of men representing the policy and
the party that have the confidence of the majority of the delegates.
Its decisions have largely to be unanimous. When a member cannot pull
on with the rest, he can resign, but he may not obstruct or affect
the deliberations of the Committee by an open discussion of its
deliberations in the Press. Whilst, therefore, the decisions of the
Working Committee should be carried out by Congressmen, it is not an
irresponsible body. It can be dismissed by the All-India Congress
Committee by a vote of no-confidence. Its decisions are subject to be
reviewed by the All-India Congress Committee, and even set aside for
grave reasons. In my humble opinion, unless the Working Committee
carries weight with people, it is hardly possible to attain swaraj
during this year. Every one of us must, therefore, work to make the
Congress an irresistible body by its resolutions being carried out in
every little detail. What the Government does in the last resort by
force of arms the Congress expects to do by force of affection. The
Government has rendered itself irresistible by striking terror in the
hearts of the people, the Congress must make itself felt by securing
the free-will acceptance of its doctrines and policies. Non-violence
thus runs through everything connected with the people’s programme.
But each organization ex-pects to succeed by reason of people’s
co-operation. Loyalty to the Congress decisions is a <i>sine qua non
</i>of success of the Nagpur determination to achieve swaraj during
the year.</p>

children. I expect the greatest results from the experiment of
introducing the charkha in the national schools. If it is conducted
on scientifice lines by teachers who believe in the charkha as the
most efficient means of making education available to the seven and a
half lakhs of villages in India, there is not only no danger of
weariness, but every prospect of the nation being able to solve the
problem of financing mass education without any extra taxation and
without having to fall back upon immoral sources of revenue.</p>

The writer in the <i>Indian </i><i>Social </i><i>Reformer </i>suggests
that  an attempt should be made to produce finer counts on the
spinning- wheel. I may assure him that the process has already begun,
but it will be some time before we arrive at the finish of the Dacca
muslin or even twenty counts. Seeing that hand-spinning was only
revived last September, and India began to believe in it somewhat
only in December, the progress it has made may be regarded as
phenomenal.</p>

The writer’s complaint that hand-spun yarn is not being woven as
fast as it is spun is partly true. But the remedy is not so much to
increase the number of looms as to persuade the existing weavers to
use hand-spun yarn. Weaving is a much more complex process than
spinning. It is not, like spinning, only a supplementary industry,
but a complete means of livelihood. It therefore never died out.
There are <i>enough weavers </i><i>and </i><i>enough looms </i><i>in
</i><i>India </i><i>to </i><i>replace </i><i>the </i><i>whole </i><i>of
</i><i>the </i><i>foreign import </i><i>of </i><i>cloth</i>. It
should be understood that our looms— thousands of them in Madras,
Maharashtra and Bengal—are engaged in weaving the fine yarn
imported from Japan and Manchester. We <i>must </i>utilize these for
weaving hand-spun yarn. And for that purpose, the nation has to
revise its taste for the thin, tawdry and useless  muslins. I see no
art in weaving muslins that do not cover but only expose the body.
Our ideas of art must undergo a change. But even if the universal
weaving of thin fabric be considered desirable in normal conditions,
at the present moment whilst we are making a mighty effort to become
free and self-supporting, we must be content to wear the cloth that
our hand-spun yarn may yield. We have therefore to ask the
fashionable on the one hand to be satisfied with coarser garments; we
must educate the spinners on the other hand to spin finer and more
even yarn.</p>

The writer pleads for a reduction in the prices charged by mill-
owners for their manufactures. When lovers of swadeshi begin to
consi-der it their duty to wear khaddar, when the required number of
spinning-wheels are working and the weavers are weaving hand-spun</p>

yarn, the mill-owners will be bound to reduce prices. It seems almost
hopeless merely to appeal to the patriotism of those whose chief aim
is to increase their own profits.</p>

Incongruities pointed out by the writer such as the wearing of
khaddar on public occasions and at other times of the most
fashionable English suits, and the smoking of most expensive cigars
by wearers of khaddar must disappear in course of time, as the new
fashion gains strength. It is my claim that as soon as we have
completed the boycott of foreign cloth, we shall have evolved so far
that we shall necessarily give up the present absurdities and remodel
national life in keeping with the ideal of simplicity and domesticity
implanted in the bosom of the masses. We will not then be dragged
into an imperialism which is built upon exploitation of the weaker
races of the earth, and the acceptance of a giddy materialistic
civilization protected by naval and air forces that have made
peaceful living almost impossible. On the contrary, we shall then
refine that imperialism into a commonwealth of nations which will
combine, if they do, for the purpose of giving their best to the
world and of protecting, not by brute force but by self-suffering,
the weaker nations or races of the earth. Non-co-operation aims at
nothing less than this revolution in the thought-world. Such a
transformation can come only after the complete success of the
spinning-wheel. India can become fit for delivering such a message
when she has become proof against temptation and, therefore, attacks
from outside, by becoming self- contained regarding two of her chief
needs—food and clothing.</p>

I publish this letter without any alteration. The writer has sent me
his name, but wishes to remain anonymous. I have seen, both in Natal
and Champaran, the writer’s prototypes. He means well, but does not
know that he is no more than a kind cattle-keeper. Once admit that
men may be treated like cattle, many a European manager would earn a
certi-ficate of merit from a Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
Society. I know from experience that free medicine, free medical
attendance, free hous-ing accommodation and free grazing- ground are
so many tricks of the trade, designed to keep the ‘coolie’  a
serf for ever. He would be a freer man for being paid full wages and
charged for housing and medicine. Free grazing-ground is to
him,almost like breathing, indis-pensable. Eurasian children tell on
every estate the story of man’s and woman’s shame. If I had the
power, I would stop all the estates where the crime against Indian
womanhood is proved by the presence of Eurasian children. I know the
problem is difficult. But if the European learnt to respect the
chastity of the Indian’s woman as his sister’s, there would be no
Eurasian children born out of wedlock. I am no believer in ‘free’
intercourse. The subject is too painful, the chastity of man and
woman too sacred for me, to enable me to write with restraint on what
I have seen on such estates, and heard. I do not for one moment wish
to suggest that Indian managers would not commit the same crimes that
European managers do. I know that their colour hides the shame in the
faces of their crimes’ creation. But I do  maintain  that  the
European manager does with impunity what the Indian dare not. But I
must close this chapter here. The disingenuous suggestion that the
manager should be the president of panchayat gives  away  the
planters’ case. The corres-pondent’s advice regarding non-co-
operation proceeds from igno-rance. I can assure him that I never
advised a single coolie in Assam to strike. I do not profess to know
the problem of labour there. He should, more-over, know that there is
no non-co-operation going on with capital or capitalists. Non-co-
operation is going on with the existing Govern-ment as a system. But
there is bound to be non-co-operation wherever there is evil,
oppression and injustice, whether anybody wishes it or not. The
people, having found the remedy, will resort to it. If they do so
stu- pidly or unjustifiably, they alone will be the real losers. I do
not believe that legislation or debates in the Councils can do much
good. Not until em-ployers begain to look upon labourers as members
of their own family, or until the latter are educated to understand
their</p>

own rights and know the method of securing them, will labourers be
able to better their position. Legislation in advance of public
opinion is often worse than useless. Non-co-operation is the quickest
method of creating public opinion, in the present case a change of
manners, or as I have often put it, of heart.</p>

	I am writing these notes on the day prior to the day of our test.
	Whether the product will be a perfect, full-sized pot or only a
	tumbler, the workers alone know, and God. The result corresponds to
	the sin- cerity behind the effort. If those engaged in collection
	work  are sincere enough, the result is bound to follow. There is no
	doubt now about 10 lakhs being collected from Gujarat. The
	expectation, rather, is that the actual collection will exceed this
	figure. And why not? We have plenty, relatively. The mills in
	Gujarat can by themselves fulfil our expectation. The enterprising
	business men engaged in trade outside Gujarat can give something.
	The Princes can give if they but shed fear. We have never, in the
	past, attempted such tasks as a people, never tested our strength.
	In our timidity, therefore we put the figure rather low. As we
	gradually shed our fear, we shall go forward.</p>

However, with more money, more members and more spinning- wheels, our
responsibility also increases.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>It
is not enough that we have secured the crore. We should know to keep
clear and complete accounts. We are not going to put the crore out at
interest. We have collected it for our <i>immediate needs</i>. We
have to elevate national life by means of it. We must boycott foreign
cloth. We must introduce a system of national education. We must
ameliorate the wretched condition of the suppressed classes. We must
free the nation from the clutches of drink. We must banish for ever
the spectre of famine from our country. The crore could be used up
for all these things. For this, we need honest workers. Our accounts
should be open for inspection even to a child. All hopes for
assistance in the future must naturally depend upon a proper
adminis-tration of the present trust. We have got in our collections
the priceless ornaments of sinless sisters. Many girls have given up
all such jewellery as was so dear to them. I know the names of some,
but I do not care to publish them. They have not cared for publicity.
I think them to be so holy that I would not like to take their names
in vain. They have given only for the joy of giving. One widowed
sister gave me all the pearls and rubies that  still  remained with
her. My heart wept within me, as I accepted them. Are we fit
recipients of gifts like these? A widow never likes to part with her
ornaments; she holds them with all the greater tenacity. I put this
sister on her guard. I asked her to have them back, if there was the
least hesitation or bashfulness in the act of giving. She did not
withdraw; she was already fully determined on the step she took. What
if we use money thus obtained negligently, foolishly or dis-honestly?
We should not only be disappointed in our hope of swaraj. We should
become the ever hopeless denizens of the darkest hell. I trust that
the purity of these sisters—their religious fervour—will keep us
on the straight path, will not allow our honour to be tarnished, and
will lead to the fulfilment of all our desires and aspirations.</p>

movement. I have merely smiled. The Parsi population in the country
totals one lakh. On the basis only of numbers, their  contribution
would be full if they gave Rs. 4,120, provided the same number of
members and accounted for 824 spinning-wheels. As a matter of fact,
Rs.. 4,120 have come from them just by way of petty contributions.
The sums which Parsi friends sent anonymously must have come to this
total. I also include in this Fund Parsi Rustomjee’s contribution
of Rs. 52,000. The Parsis must have, I believe, provided 4,120
members too. Some Parsi volunteers have been enrolling members of the
Congress and doing excellent work in Bombay. There has been a Parsi
lawyer, too, who gave up practice. One gentleman has resolved to
utilize his scientific knowledge for the service of the people. It is
true that the number of spinning-wheels among them is small, but even
so Parsi women, and some men too, have taken up the work. Some Parsis
also go out to picket liquor-booths. How can one say, in the face of
this, that they in any way done less than others? Not all papers run
by them are opposed to the movement. The services of <i>Sanj </i><i>Vartman
</i>are known to all. Who has not heard of Shri Bharucha’s hard
work? As for the work being done by some Parsi ladies, I shall give
my experiences some other time, but there is one name I must mention.
The grand-daughter of India’s “Grand Old Man” has been working
tirelessly. She has, actually, adopted a com-pletely khadi dress.
Even if the Parsi community had done no more than what they have, we
would have reason to be grateful to them, would have no reason for
pointing a finger at them.</p>

But the fact is that Shri Godrej has done something which far exceeds
any other performances. He has contributed three lakhs. No other
single individual has given so much. True, the entire amount is not
available in cash today, but it is as secure as if offered in gold.
He has earmarked the sum for two of the purest items in our
programme, banishing liquor and <i>Antyaj </i>uplift. Money was
earmarked for the latter cause on his insistence. For myself, I would
have preferred to employ only Hindus’ money for this work. It is
for them to carry out this particular reform. But how could I stand
in the way of this friend who offered what he did in utter sincerity
of heart? With the receipt of this amount, I believe the total
contribution by Parsis, so far as my information goes, will easily
come to not less than four lakhs, leaving out the value of the gifts
promised by some of them. We cannot thank Shri Godrej and the Parsi
community sufficiently.</p>

Some persons seem to be under the impression that, after June, they
should not collect or send contributions without permission. This is
altogether wrong. All these days we concentrated our attention on the
three aims laid down at Bezwada. This does not mean that, after June,
we may not enrol new members of get new spinning-wheels made or
collect further contributions. After completing the figure of one
crore, we may, if we like, stop collections for the Tilak Swaraj
Fund, but we are bound to continue them till that time. Our pledge
has two aspects, collecting an amount of one crore and doing this
before June 30. Even if we fail to collect the required amount before
this date but, continuing our efforts, succeed in doing so later, we
shall have done our duty. We may feel shame at our failure to do the
thing within the time-limit, but we should certainly not prove
shameless by refusing contributions altogether or offering less after
the time-limit has expired. I hope, therefore, that those who ar
still to give their contributions to this Fund will do so even
afterwards. As for Gujarat, it will have no need to make any such
efforts since it will have fulfilled its self-imposed obligation.</p>

So much about the Tilak Swaraj Fund. What about members and
spinning-wheels? Only this, that before June 30 Gujarat should enrol
not less than three lakh members and put into commission not less
than one lakh spinning-wheels. Our duty, however, is to see  that
Gujarat enrols every man and woman of 21 years and over, that every
home in the province has a spinning-wheel and that everyone, from
ripe old men to mere children, is persuaded to learn spinning. If we
put the population of Gujarat at 90 lakhs and count the number of
homes at the rate of one for every five persons, we get 18 lakh
homes. We should not, therefore, rest satisfied till we have  put 
into commission 18 lakh spinning-wheels. There can be no upper limit
for the enrolment of members and the spread of spinning-wheels. The
more of them we have the greater will be our strength, the brighter
the swaraj flag, the stronger the wind filling the sails of the
swaraj ship and the faster the speed. From the number of members and

Gandhi then referred to the liquor shops. He said there was a great
respon- sibility on the shoulders of the Parsis in Bombay. There were
about nine hundred country liquor shops in the town and the majority
of them were owned by the Parsis. Many Parsis had approached him and
told him that they had already given a year’s purchase price to
Government and that if their shops were picketed they would be ruined
and they would lose all their money. He had considered over these
things, and he felt very sorry for the shopkeepers. He was not sorry
at all for the Parsis if they were co-operating with Government or if
they had not given up their titles. But the liquor shops were a more
serious matter. He was sorry that Hindus and Mohammedans were the
only pickets. He wished his Parsi brothers and sisters would also
picket. He wanted no force to be used because he did not wish any
objectionable methods in [the achievement of] the holy object they
had. When Parsi women stood in the path of Parsis going to these
drink shops they would be ashamed to enter the shops and they would
be ashamed to abuse them and they would not beat them. He asked the
Parsis to give up drink, and to help their people who had to shut up
their shops on account of picketing. He asked them to help the
shopkeepers to get a refund of their [licence] fees from the
Government and to help them in every possible way. In Ahmedabad a
Parsi contractor had complained to him that he had been assaulted by
the pickets and he found this statement on investigation to be false.
It was the volunteers on the other hand who had been assaulted, and
they were now picketing with their heads bandaged and they had not
raised their hands to retaliate.</font></font></p>

The paragraph in the papers about your jewels takes away all the
grace from<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>your
gift. I had hoped that it was a silent act of<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

more than you have. They have not wished to advertise themselves. A
sister gave me two days ago all her rich jewels—pearl necklaces and
ruby bracelets and ear-rings. She gave them with such humility and
grace. Her name she does not want. She gave them for the sake of God.
I am sorry for you. Pray forgive me for this bitter truth. . . .</p>

India has succeeded in raising, by the end of June, a sum of
approximately 80 lakhs for perpetuating the memory of the Lokamanya
and establishing swaraj. I hope that the people will raise the
balance of 20 lakhs without delay. Though the Bezwada programme
cannot be considered to have been literally fulfilled, people’s
response to the Congress appeal may be said to have been excellent.
Bombay’s gene-rosity on this occasion has eclipsed its past record.
It should now join hands with the other provinces to raise the
balance as soon as possible. However, the main effort should be
directed to bringing about total boycott of foreign cloth and
completing the enrolment of one crore Con-gress members.</p>

God is great. He sends help from unexpected quarters. It was but a
few days ago that Mr. Das telegraphed saying Bengal had collected no
more than three lakhs. It was no small thing for me to announce that
India had not given the full crore on the due date. I struggled with
friends for getting the deficit underwritten. They were ready to give
it to me, but they would not disclose their names to the world as, in
their opinion, it looked like seeking notoriety. They thought that it
was better to leave the figure where it was and try to collect the
balance before the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee. I
capitulated but I was sore at heart that God had not answered my
prayer. And yet I knew Him to be an unfailing God. He sent Bengal to
the rescue and ratified the nation’s undertaking at Bezwada. Let us
be humble and praise Him. But we dare not tarry on the road to make
merry. We must march forward. Each Province should at least make up
its numerical proportion of the crore, although the total collection
amounts now to one crore and five lakhs<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

But our next inevitable step is to bring about a complete boycott of
foreign cloth. On the first of August, we celebrate the anniversary
of Lokamanya’s death. We can, if we make a definite special effort,
bring about an almost complete boycott of foreign cloth before that
date. I know it requires the consensus of an over-whelming majority.
But it is not impossible to reach it if we would work with the same
zeal as we have for the collections. Then and not till then will
India have attained the power to establish swaraj. I cannot conceive
any better celebration of the anniversary of Lokamanya’s death than
a ccomplete boycott of foreign cloth.</p>

You will not hear me speak about money any more. We have now to think
only of what we should do next. If money comes, it is welcome. It
would be no great sacrifice to spend even 10 crores for the sake of
Tilak Maharaj, let alone one crore. For swaraj, we may spend even as
much as that, if necessary. But 10 crores will certainly not be
required. He is no man of practical wisdom who spends a pie more than
necessary. You should now think of only one thing. On August 1 comes
the death anniversary of Tilak Maharaj; what shall we do on that day,
something which will be worthy of the occasion?</p>

You should admire the <i>mantra </i>which Tilak Maharaj gave. Be
captivated not by his scholarship or sweet speech, but by his work,
the <i>yajna </i>which was his life and the sacrifices which he made.
You should accomplish the task on which he had set his heart, for
which he gave his life, for which he suffered privations. There can
be no better memorial to him than that. It is better that you win
swaraj, though you may not have collected a single pie, than that you
should merely collect thousands of crores. I am quite confident that
you will do this. But you can do nothing unless you think in terms of
swaraj. You must give up foreign cloth. No one will kill you for
doing so, only you will have to do a little persuading with
yourselves. In the same way that we give a dose of medicine to a
child, women should swallow this bitter draught. Do not wait for
August 1, but examine your ward-robe, your body and your head without
losing a single day. Foreign cloth constitutes our slavery. You
should throw it off, you merchants especially. If anyone offers his
contribution to a fund in memory of Tilak Maharaj with a word of
abuse for him at the same time, how can I accept that? If I do,
Maharashtra will certainly sever my head for doing so. If we wish to
have a true memorial to Tilak Maharaj, then all of us must  become
swadeshi. Unless we do that,  we   shall  not be considered fit for
swaraj. If you contribute money, do so only as a token of your
resolve to give up foreign cloth. It will not be right of you to
contribute anything to the Swaraj Fund, hoping to make it up from
business in foreign cloth.</p>

Regard foreign cloth as no better than beef or liquor. In your
busi-ness as commission agents, you now supply foreign cloth also.
Take a pledge, therefore, that hereafter you will not supply such
cloth to your clients. Can any Hindu supply liquor to a client who
asks for it? How can we ever trade in a commodity which it is not
right for us to supply to our clients? In the same way, we cannot
trade in foreign cloth. You shou-ld certainly learn to hate not
Englishmen or the manufacturers of English cloth, but foreign cloth
as such. How can you make money through a trade which enslaves our
country? A Parsi brother came to me arguing about liquor. I told him
that he must renounce trade in liquor even if he were to become a
beggar in consequence. How can you earn money through something the
very sight of which is repugnant to both, the Hindus and the Muslims

I do not understand why we may not picket foreign cloth shops as we
picket liquor shops. Boycotting foreign cloth is, if anything, more
important. Sisters, it is contrary to dharma for you to  buy foreign
cloth. To buy foreign cloth is to adopt another’s child, disowning
one’s own. You believe that you look beautiful in foreign cloth.
But true beauty consists in devotion to duty. Sita preferred to cover
her body with leaves, refusing to accept the garment sent by the
proud Ravana. You too, sisters, should become Sitas. How can you ask
for swaraj without giving up foreign cloth at the same time? Before
August 1, you must do this at any rate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Anyone among you who has the courage to do so should burn his stock
of foreign cloth. Those, too, who wish to give it to the poor should
give it to me, as they do not know the really poor. Only I know them.
If you had known them, you would not have taken delight in going
about dressed in foreign cloth and would not be indulging in
pleasures. Give up your fascination for foreign things. Then alone
will our task be done. Keep the promise implied in the money you have
contributed. That is what we want now.</p>

Many among you are my relations, many belong to the same community as
I do and many of you are my friends from childhood days. From all
these I get letters. In some of them the correspondents compli-ment
me on my views about <i>Antyajas</i>, in some others they gently
remon-strate with me, thinking that I am in error in holding these
views, in some the correspondents treat me to harsh words in their
anger and in some they actually hold out threats against me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I regard all these things as a sign of their love for me. There are
many others, besides me, who hold the same views about <i>Antyajas </i>as
I do and do not object to contact with them, but people are angry
with me and the reason, as I understand it, is that they believe
that, in all other respects, I follow the restraints of dharma to the
utmost and am otherwise a good man. They cannot reconcile themselves
to what they believe to be my erroneous views about <i>Antyajas</i>.
They think that these views hold up our progress towards swaraj. Some
even believe that I have gone out of my way to invite trouble and
have, in my obstinacy, endangered the ship of swaraj.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
My own humble belief, against this, is that my concern for <i>Antyajas
</i>is a credit to my devotion to the <i>Vaishnava </i>way of life,
that it is an expression of pure compassion, and that it proves my
scrupulous regard for the restraints of religious life.</p>
<p align="RIGHT" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Some <i>Vaishnavas </i>believe that I am destroying <i>varnashrama</i>.
On the contrary, I believe that I am trying to cleanse it of
impurities and so reveal its true form. I am certainly not advocating
abolition of restrictions on eating and drinking in company with
anyone and everyone or on intermarrying among communities. I merely
say that the idea that physi-cal contact with some person is a sin is
itself sinful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.4cm">The
attempt to defend the practice of untouchability by citing</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
the similar practice of avoiding contact with a woman during the
period of menstruation does not convince me. A  chance contact with a
woman during this time is not looked upon as a sin. It is held to be
violation of a rule of hygiene and so the person takes a bath to be
clean again. If anyone avoided contact with an <i>Antyaj </i>who had
been engaged in sanitary work and had not bathed or otherwise
cleansed himself after the work, or, in case he had contact with such
an <i>Antyaj</i>, went and had a  bath, I  can understand the idea.
But my  conscience</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.65cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
can never accept the idea that dharma requires us to keep away
scrupulously from everyone born an <i>Antyaj</i>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The inspiration of the <i>Vaishnava </i>way is compassion. I do not
see a trace of this in our treatment of the <i>Antyajas</i>. Many
among us never address an <i>Antyaj </i>except with a word of
contempt. If an <i>Antyaj </i>is ever found sitting in the same
compartment with other Hindus, there will be a rain of abuse on him.
We offer them food left over on our plates, as we do to cattle. If an
<i>Antyaj </i>has fever or is bitten by a serpent, our <i>vaids </i>and
doctors will refuse to go to his place and treat him. If anyone
should get ready to go, we would do everything in our power to stop
him. For their residence, the <i>Antyajas </i>get the worst
localities, with no amenities like light and public streets. They are
provided with no wells for their use. They cannot use public wells
and dharmsalas and cannot attend schools. We expect from them the
most difficult of services and pay them the least. The sky above and
the earth below is all that they have by way of shelter. Is such
treatment in keeping with the <i>Vaishnava </i>way of life? Is it the
way inspired by compassion, is it not rather the way of cruelty? The
British Government, against which you have launched non-co-operation,
does not treat us with such contempt. We actually cherish our Dyerism
towards <i>Antyajas </i>as dharma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
Speaking for myself, I believe that we are reaping as we sowed.
Treating the <i>Antyajas </i>with contempt, we have become objects of
the entire world’s contempt.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
The idea of untouchability is unacceptable to reason. It is contrary
to truth and non-violence and, therefore, is certainly not dharma.
The very idea of our being high and others low is base. He is no true
Brahmin who lacks the quality of the Sudra : readiness for service.
He alone is a Brahmin who possesses the qualities of all others, the
Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra and, in addition,  has knowledge.
A Sudra is not altogether devoid of knowledge. Readiness for service
is predominant in him over his other qualities. The
<i>varnashrama-dharma </i>has no room for distinctions of high and
low. The <i>Vaishnava </i>tradition knows of <i>Bhangis </i>and 
<i>Chandals  </i>who attained deliverance. How can a dharma which
holds that the entire universe is permeated by Vishnu believe that He
is not present in the <i>Antyaj</i>?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have no desire, however, to interpret the Shastras to you. I do not
claim to be a man of learning. Every <i>shastri </i>is welcome to
have</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the better of me in interpreting the Shastras. I know with confidence
that I have had some experience of what the way of compassion means.
This way can have simply no room in it for an attitude of contempt
for <i>Antyajas</i>.</p>

Moreover, what people will you describe as <i>Antyajas</i>? Is a 
weaver an <i>Antyaj</i>? Are wealthy dealers in leather <i>Antyajas</i>?
Or is it that gold cleanses everything? A chamar who has given up his
traditional work, a <i>Bhangi </i>who has taken to driving a car or
works in a mill, who takes a bath every day and keeps himself clean,
is even such a person an untou-chable?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Why argue, however? So long as you believe that physical contact with
anyone whom you regard as an untouchable is a sin, you may, if you
wish, take a bath after such contact, but my request to you is that
just as you do not hold in disregard a mother who is in her period of
menstruation, but serve her instead, so should you serve <i>Antyajas
</i>instead of despising them. Dig wells for them, build schools for
them, arrange for <i>vaids </i>to visit them, make their suffering
your own and so earn their heartfelt blessings. See to it that they
have their homes in good areas. Pay them well, respect them, educate
them, look upon them as your younger brothers and persuade them to
give up drinking, beef-eating, etc. Reward those who do these things.
If you act in this way, you will come to see that the idea of
untouchability is [as the poet says] a superfluous limb. Some of you
have refused to contribute to the Tilak Swaraj Fund simply because of
my views regarding <i>Antyajas</i>. This is my appeal to you,
however: contribute money for the reform of untouchables; you can
cert-ainly do so, even if you do not abandon the practice of
untoucha-bility. Actually, some <i>Vaishnavas </i>have earmarked
their contributions for this purpose. Moreover, though you may not
like my views about <i>Antyajas</i>, you can surely give some money
for the swadeshi movement, for famine-relief and for schools. I
believe, though, that you would certainly not oppose improvement in
the conditions of <i>Antyajas</i>, and, therefore, appeal to you
that, as evidence of such regard for the principle of compassion, you
earmark your contributions for activities intended for their uplift.</p>

It is needless to say at this time of day that the proposed boycott
of foreign cloth is not a vindictive process, but is as necessary for
national existence as breath is to life. The quicker therefore it can
be brought about the better for the country. Without it swaraj cannot
be established or retained after establishment. It is of the highest
importance to know how it can be brought about even before the first
day of August next.</p>

To arrive at the boycott quickly it is necessary (1) for the mill-
owners to regularize their profits and to manufacture principally for
the Indian market, (2) for importers to cease to buy foreign goods—a
beginning has already been made by three principal merchants, (3) for
the consumers to refuse to buy any foreign cloth and to buy khadi
wherever possible, (4) for the consumers to wear only khadi cloth,
mill-cloth being retained for the poor who do not know the
distinction between swadeshi and  <i>pardeshi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>, (5)  for  the  consumers  to  use,  till swaraj is
established and khadi manufacture increased, khadi just enough for
covering the body, (6) for the consumers to destroy <i>pardeshi </i>cloth
as they would destroy intoxi-cating liquors on taking the vow of
abstinence or to sell it for use abroad or to wear it out for all
dirty work or during private hours.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
It is to be hoped that all the parties referred to in the foregoing
clauses will respond well and simultaneously. But, in the end,
success depends upon the persistent determination of the consumer. He
has simply to decline to wear the badge of his slavery.</p>

pie we receive and do not make a judicious use of the funds, we shall
deserve to be blotted out of public life. Let us remember that the
poorest people have given of their best. Many have given their all.
Washermen, carpenters, blacksmiths, Christians, Jews, Parsis, Sikhs,
Jains, Mussulmans and Hindus have paid their mite. On the 16th of
June, when the collection commenced in Bombay, the whole amount
collected throughout India stood at thirty lakhs, if even at that. I
had full faith that forty lakhs would be collected by the end of June
by provinces other than Bombay. All India, therefore, subscribed at
the rate of more than five lakhs per day during the fourteen days of
concentrated effort. The provinces outside Bombay had subscribed up
to the 30th June during the same period as Bombay, thirty-eight
lakhs—not a bad record. How shall we retain this confidence? We
must keep accurate accounts, which even a child can see and
understand. The funds ought not to be used outside the purpose of
non-co-operation, nor generally for any purpose outside (1) the 
spread of the charkha and khadi, (2) the removal of untouchability,
and hence, the elevation of the suppressed classes, (3) the conduct
of national schools, where spinning and weaving are a part of the

I would warn the different Committees against living on the interest
of the funds. To invest the money at interest and to use only the
interest is to betray want of faith in the nation and in ourselves.
The nation’s trust must be our capital, and its response from time
to time must constitute our interest. If we claim to represent the
nation, we must rely upon it to finance yearly institutions
established and conducted for it. Living on interest tends to make us
irresponsible. The hoards rotting in the name of religion in the
various parts of India have made many of these religious institutions
a sham, where they have not become hotbeds of corruption. If,
therefore, we would profit by our past experience, we would spend
almost the whole amount collected by us during the remaining six
months. When I placed the financial programme before the All-India
Congress Committee in Bezwada, I did so because I knew that we had
honest and able men enough to deal with national and provincial
finance, and because we needed that amount for use during the year.
We cannot</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
achieve boycott of foreign cloth unless we spend liberally in buying
spinning-wheels, hand-spun yarn and khadi. We must conduct the
swadeshi propaganda till the spinning-wheel has been placed on a
commercial footing and has found a lasting place in every home.
Distributed over a large area, the crore is not much to spend till
the end of the year. I would suggest every province framing at the
end of the month its own considered budget and spending not less nor
more.  I have suggested a month, for the provinces would hardly have
made up their accounts and collected the promised subscriptions
before then. More-over, we must wait for the All-India Congress
Committee to give us a definite lead for the months to follow. If we
succeed in fulfilling the programme in an orderly manner, we cannot
fail to establish swaraj before December, if not by the end of
September.</p>

election results showed that only one Mussulman was elected, and that
was Mr. Umar Sobani who could hardly be claimed specially to
represent the Mussul-man interest. He is too well known as a public
worker to be classed purely as a Mussulman representative. Moreover,
in Bombay it was necessary to have at least two Muslim members
elected to the All-India Congress Committee. Mr. Vithaldas Jerajani
has therefore vacated his seat for a Mussulman representative. It is
instances of such brotherly and public spirit make me feel that
swaraj is hastening to us. The only danger is that of our running
away from it. In my opinion, the incident proves the wisdom of the
Working Committee’s advice. It came just in time to put us on our
guard and honour. The Working Committee warns us that we may not
neglect special and tender interests, and that wherever there is the
least suspicion of Mussulman coolness, it is up to the Hindus to see
that they do notgive the slightest reason for Mussulman coolness or
indifferenceor suspicion. And what applies to  Hindus  and Mussulmans
applies also to questions regarding and between the other races. The
weaker the interest, the greater must be the regard of the stron-ger
party for that interest. Then we need never have any racial
differences.</p>

I strengthen our position when I invite the Moderates in gentle

<i>The </i><i>Indian Social Reformer </i>contests the utility of
picketing in its vigorous style. Without entering upon any
examination of its argument, I would perhaps take up less space if I
simply stated my view and experience. Picketing in its nature must be
temporary, but it is like what a stimulant is in medicine. Drink is
more a disease than a vice.I know scores of men who would gladly
leave off drink if they could.I know some who have asked that the
temptation might be put away from them. In spite of the temptation
having been put away at their instance, I have known them to steal
drink. I do not, therefore, think, that it was wrong to have removed
the temptation. Diseased persons have got to be helped against
themselves. If I have a son who is addicted, say, to gambling, and a
gambling company imposes itself on me to tempt my boy, I have either
violently to knock the company down or to post watches at its
offices, in order, if possible, to shame my son into not going there.
It is true that there are other gambling companies some distance from
my place. Still, I take it, I would be held in the right in having
posted a watch at the company’s door. I must make it difficult for
my son to gamble. If the <i>Reformer </i>accepts the doctrine of
State prohibition, it must accept the corollary of picketing, so long
as the State is a tyranny being perpetrated in the face of public
opinion. What, for instance, should the public do if the State were
to build palaces in every street for women of ill fame, and issue to
them licences to ply their trade? Will it not be its duty, unless it
destroys these palaces inhabited by vice, to quarantine them and warn
the public of the danger of falling an easy prey to the temptation
forced on it? I recognize the necessity of using only men and women
of character as pickets and of guarding against violence being
offered to those who insist on drinking in the face of  public 
opinion. Picketing is a duty a citizen must discharge when he is not
helped by the State. What is a police patrol if it is not picketing
against thieves? The police use the gun when the thief betrays an
inclination to break into another’s house. A picket uses the
pressure of shame, i.e., love, when he warns a weak brother against
the dangers of  the  drink evil.The <i>Reformer </i>has attributed to

If the Congress Committee’s telegram to the <i>Chronicle </i>may be
relied upon, there is little doubt that some unauthorized police
officer has been panic-stricken and given the order to fire on an
unarmed crowd. The persistent keeping open of liquor shops, as if it
was a right of the public to have liquor served to it by the State,
is an open and immoral defiance of public opinion. I can only
congratulate the families of those who have died. I can deplore the
slightest show of force that may have been betrayed by the crowd, but
I respectfully warn the Indian ministers in charge of transferred
departments that they will belie the traditions of the great party to
which they belong if they do not courageously face the grave crisis
that is overtaking the country and summarily close every liquor shop
and refund the money paid in advance by the poor licence-holders.
They may not dread the loss of revenue immorally derived from the
twice-cursed traffic. It cannot stand in the face of an awakened and
enraged public conscience. As it is, an education supported by a
revenue derived from an immoral source is bad enough. Presently, it
will stink in our nostrils when it is tainted with innocent blood. I
do beseech the ministers to be warned before it is too late. Let it
not be said of them that for the sake of revenue they remained
callously indifferent to the signs of the times. They dare not wait
for hours, much less for weeks. It will be wrong to wait for devising
methods of tapping other sources of revenue before giving up the
revenue from drink. It will be very like a man refusing to vacate a
plague-infected house until another is ready for him. Most people in
such circumstances will first vacate, and then search for another and
uninfected shelter.</p>

Sardar Shardul Singh has always appeared to me to be one of the
bravest of non-co-operators. He is a man of fine culture,
scrupulously honourable. He has reasoned faith in non-violent non-
co-operation. He is a staunch nationalist. He holds the Sikh doctrine
dear as life, but loves nationalism equally well. Non-violence is not
his final creed in everything. But it is like that of the Ali
Brothers, his present creed for India’s salvation. He abides by it
as honourably as the Ali Brothers, which is saying a great deal. But
this State has no use for him except transportation for five years.
He is too brave, too honest and therefore, too influential for the
Government of the  Punjab, and, therefore, he has been put away. It
is my conviction that his services to the country are all the greater
for his incarceration. It is</p>

It is a great pity that the talk of the Prince’s visit has been
revived and a provisional date fixed. India will refuse to welcome a
representative of a system of which she is sick unto death. And if
his visit is forced upon an unwilling India, there must be  the  same
effective hartal on the day of His Royal Highness’s visit that
there was on the Duke’s visit. I repeat once more that
non-co-operators have nothing against the Prince as a man. But he
cannot be divested of the office he holds. Whilst it is true that the
King and his heirs do not acti- vely meddle in the affairs of State
(which is a convenience for the State), he is as effective a
representative of the existing system of Government as the most
meddlesome Prime Minister or Viceroy. I am disposed to think that, as
a supporter of the institution, he is more effective by reason of his
isolation. If the Prince comes, he will not come to bless the
non-co-operators or the cause, but to sing the song of praise for a
Government which is responsible for the dishonour of the Pujnab, for
breach of faith with the Mussulmans, for forcing the drink traffic on
India, for impoveri-shing her and for so emasculating her that she
almost thinks she must remain in slavery for  an unthinkable time. In
my humble opinion, the projected visit will be an insult added to
injury. And it will be the duty of every non-co- operator,
respectfully but firmly and in no unmistakable manner, to express his
strong disapproval of all such efforts to bolster  up  a  system
which is tottering to its fall.</p>

Bombay is beautiful, not for its big buildings for most of them hide
squalid poverty and dirt, not for its wealth for most of it is
derived from the blood of the masses, but for its world-renowned
generosity.The Parsis set the tone, and Bombay has ever lived up to
her reputation. Bombay’s charity has covered a multitude of her
sins. In respect of the Tilak Swaraj Fund, Bombay has beaten her past
records. Between the sixteenth and the thirtieth June, she subscribed
at the rate of two lakhs and a half per day. She enabled India to
keep her promise. And I have no doubt, Chittaranjan Das will allow

twenty five, in spite of the Herculean labours of Bombay’s choicest
workers India would have failed to raise the crore. Bombay, then,  is
 beautiful because of her charities.</p>

The figures are not to hand, of the number of members nor of the
wheels at work. But the subscription was the most visible token of
India’s resolve.</p>

India has honoured the late Lokamanya as  she  has  not honoured any
other son before. But the crore is but the foundation of the of the
monument that we are raising to the memory  of the deceased patriot;
swaraj is the crown. No monument less than swaraj can revere a memory
so great.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Let us however not deceive ourselves. To be true to the spirit of the
memorial resolution, each province and each district should have
subscribed at least its numerical proportion. Two pice per head was
not a contribution beyond the means of the average man or woman. And
I hope that every province will strive to make up its quota as early
as possible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The subscription is but a milestone on the journey. The crore cannot
give us swaraj, not the riches of the whole world can give it. Before
we can be wholly free, we must be economically independent. A man who
is forced to starve cannot be expected to pray to God. A starving man
will sell his soul. He has no soul keep.Before, therefore, India can
think of freedom, she must feel economically independent. And this
she cannot do so long as she is almost wholly dependent upon the
foreign market for her cloth. One who owes his oxygen to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the pump is a dying man. Is it any wonder that India is in a dying
condition? If, then, we want to achieve swaraj during this year, we
cannot do so till we have brought about by self-renunciation a
complete boycott of foreign cloth. We must, therefore, utilize the
money we have for manufacturing as much khadi as possible through
handlooms from hand-spun yarn. It must be the chief activity in each
province. We must examine the manu-factures of our mills, and
persuade the mill-owners to regulate their manu-facture and their
profits in accordance with the requirements of the nation. The mill
manufactures must be reserved for the poorest among the poor whom we
cannot reach for the moment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The ensuing meeting of the All-India Congress Committee must
concentrate on this matter and formulate a programme that should
bring about the desired boycott.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
But, after all, the burden of boycott has to be principally borne by
Bombay, as she has borne the largest part of the  financial
obligation. Bombay controls the cloth market of India. Bombay imports
from Lancashire and Japan. Heavy, therefore, is the responsibility of
Bombay importers of yarn and piece-goods. If a successful boycott is
to be brought about, they must be prepared to undergo heavy
sacrifices for the sake of the country. Mill-owners, too, have a duty
to perform. They have made enormous profits. It is the easiest for
them to help the boycott movement in a most effective manner. It
means a revision of their outlook upon national life. The mill-hands,
too, have a duty by the country. Hitherto they have interested
themselves only in their own wages. They should now learn to
appreciate public welfare. Lastly comes the unfortunate public, which
has no say in fixing prices, and has to pay at the bidding of the
mill-owner and the middleman. Surely, even apart from the  question
of boycott, this is a most unsatisfactory state of  things. Famine
threatens the land. It is high time that each one of us thought about
the good  of all rather than individual aggrandisement irrespective
of national welfare. Bombay the Beautiful has a golden opportunity.
She must add to her beauty, or be prepared to lose what she has.</p>

it will be the middleman who will prey upon the people. I consider

nothing wrong if you combined philanthropy with business. But I do
plead for the conduct of your business on national rather than purely
selfish lines. A man is not less business-like because he thinks of

therefore, without prejudice to your views about non-co-operation, to
issue your assurance that neither the merchants nor the consumer need

	I got your letter yesterday. I certainly understood what you had
	said. I have not, in either instance, put a wrong construction or
	shown myself prone to do so. It is perfectly true that, when a
	statement is capable of two interpretations, the right course is to
	accept the one which is unfavourable to ourselves. The difficulty,
	in the two instances, was not this; it was what I have described it
	to be. In reading ‘twenty- five lakhs’ there was nothing
	particularly more favourable to us, for, even without this sum, one
	crore had been made up and the telegram was actually received after
	the last letter was written. It would make no difference to our
	cause whether he donated one lakh charkhas or offered them at a
	lower price. Even now, I do not understand the sentence about one
	lakh charkhas to mean anything else. There is impatience, it is
	true, in all these efforts to decide what the sentence means;
	impatience, too, is a sign of one’s being attached and attachment
	is always a source of error. A person who is free from attachment
	finds time to reflect and puts a construction which will save the
	other party; if he is a truthful man, he will, as I have pointed

Spin daily for not less than one hour, concentrating the mind on the
thought that this <i>yajna </i>may wash away uncleanliness from you.
This, too, for a year, with exemption during travelling and illness.</p>

All other work in the morning to be attended to afterwards. After you
have, on getting up, cleaned your teeth and answered the call of
nature, if you feel the urge, prayers if you are in the Ashram and
then, half an hour’s silent reading as above, followed by spinning
for one hour. Everything else to wait.</p>

Though prescribing this atonement, I neither magnify your lapse nor
minimize it. You may drop from this any item you feel like dropping.
Do not drop spinning out of a feeling of shame. Do not let any such
feeling or the thought of public service hold you back from going to
bed at 9. And do not let <i>The </i><i>Independent </i>stand in your
way. It is not necessary that one writing for a daily should keep
late hours. In any case, the lines along which we propose to run it
requires you to do no such thing.</p>

Remember that the hour and a half outlined above is to be a time of
silence. Devdas started reading your letter quite innocently not
know-ing what it might contain, and then I did not think it proper to
stop him.</p>

The reasons you have given against your coming  are  quite sound and
you need not, therefore, come. If Panditji sends for you or Joseph
asks you to go and you come over, that would be a different story. I
do not mind your not coming, though I would have been happy if you
had come.</p>

Though I have seen your error, please do not feel that my love for
you is any the less on that account. If I were perfect, there would
be no room for any deficiency in me. Being myself an imperfect man
yearning for liberation, I would be only increasing my imperfection
if  I magnify others’ lapses.</p>

I have suggested that you daily remind yourself [of your lapse] but
the feeling of dejection must not remain. Sincere repentance is
incom-patible with dejection. Sin makes a long face. Memory of
uncleanli-ness may induce humility in as but never dejection.</p>

Yesterday I invited the mill-owners to help the foreign cloth boycott
movement. They may or may not help. I shall hope that they will. But
you cannot possibly keep yourselves from it, because the majority of
you are even convinced non-co-operators. You have made possible the
fulfilment of the Bezwada promise regarding the Tilak Memorial Swaraj
Fund. But you will say that whilst payment was a small matter to you,
your trade is a matter of life and death. It is just this
hallu-cination that is keeping swaraj away from us. If your trade is
a matter of life and death to you, is the country’s good less so?
Swaraj means that you and I put our country’s trade before ours.
The appeal to you to refrain from importing foreign cloth is in other
words an appeal to subor-dinate your individual gain to the
country’s.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
For every yard you import from England or Japan or America, you take
away from the mouth of a fellow countryman at least three annas
without giving him anything in return. Let me explain. India has
enough labour lying idle in her villages. Formerly this was utilized
for manu-facturing yarn and cloth. Foreign imports made them
compulsorily idle. And for these long years the vast majority have
found no other occu-pation. Hence, every drought sends a shiver
through every pitying heart in India. It need not be so. A drought is
not an unusual Indian pheno-menon. We feel its deadly effects,
because we are living on the margin of starvation. By prolonged
idleness we have lost the power of sustenance. Do not imagine that
these cottagers can all flock to our dozen cities where labour is
scarce and find a living. They are burdened with land which they dare
not leave even if they would. And not all the cities of India can
hold her millions. Nothing but the restoration of hand-spinning and
hand- weaving can possibly bring back lustre to the Indian eye. And I</p>

would be false to you and to India if I do not tell you that the
merchants more than the mill-owners are responsible for India’s
deep and distressing poverty. The mill-owners aggravate it, no doubt,
when they charge heavy prices. But you are so responsible that, if
you stop the importation of foreign cloth, you can revive the ancient
and honourable dharma (duty) of hand-spinning and give an impetus to
the industry of hand-weaving.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Why, after all, should the abandonment of a trade that harms India be
a matter of life and death to many of you? Surely you are resourceful
enough to find some other trade beneficial alike to you and the
country. The stopping of imports means a saving of sixty crores per
year. But it means operation on a much larger capital. It means that
all the processes on cotton will be gone throught in India. That
means business for you. It means a healthy circulation of money as
today it is a progressively exhausting drain of money from our dear
country. I ask you to disengage your great talents from an unhealthy
channel and direct them into the healthy channels that open out to
you. You must organize hand-spinning and hand-weaving. Then, you will
not be satisfied with coarse khadi as I am. You will insist on your
spinners spinning the finest counts and weavers weaving the
world-famed Dacca muslin. You will sink fortunes in it whereas I have
only paid our sisters the few thousands you have given me as a
charity. For you to leave the unholy trade in foreign cloth is to
organize the production and distribution of home-spun. It is an
enterprise worthy of your patriotism. You whisper to me that such
organization may take a few years. You have not built up your present
trade in a moment. If you are satisfied that it is a trade that has
impoverished and enslaved India, you will not stop to think of the
consequences of its destruction. You will let it go at any cost.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
And what is the cost? Not much. You have to stop all further orders
for foreign cloth or yarn. That costs nothing. You have a stock of
foreign cloth to get rid of. The world’s market is open to you for
its disposal. There are many uses to which the Indian specialities
can be put in, say, Mauritius, South Africa or East Africa. You will
but let me think out for you the best method of disposing of the
stock of foreign cloth and yarn you have.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Some of you have developed an anxiety for the requirements of the
consumer. He will accommodate himself to the shortage,feel none the
worse for it and will be better able to appreciate next year the
plenty of beautiful khadi of every variety of width and thinness.</p>

I ask you not to put an undue strain upon the consumer. It is not
right for you to put temptations in his or her way in the shape of
flimsy Japanese dhotis or saris or starchy calico. I urge you rather
to cultivate in the consumer the taste to see art in khadi. Evenness,
even softness, is not necessarily an art. The most exquisitely made
rose flower from silks has no art in it. For it has no life. But the
real flower from the garden with most petals gone is any day
infinitely superior to the finished artificial product in a dressed
window. The former is instinct with life. Would that the merchants of
India, ceasing to be mercenary, will study the ancient art and make
it their <i>business </i>to revive it. There is money in it for you
and the country. The greatest art to be revived is swaraj. There is
no swaraj without swadeshi. And swadeshi means for India a permanent
boycott of foreign cloth. I invite you to lead the way. For you have
the ability. May God grant you the strength and wisdom to lead!</p>

without pausing for rest. It is certainly a matter for satisfaction
that we have succeeded in collecting the money. That has given us
some confidence. We have had some evidence of how many are with us
and who they are, and have now the resources to spend on the tasks
which need our attention. The only programme, however, which will
give us a distant vision of swaraj is swadeshi. Spending thousands of
rupees will not enable us to enter the temple of swaraj. Swadeshi is
the one condition we must fulfil for being able to do so. The
watchman at the templegate will not ask us how much money we have; he
will look at us to see whether we are dressed in khadi and examine us
to know whether we smell of liquor. The man who follows the rule of
swadeshi will himself feel that he is a free man. Anyone who does not
feel so will not be free simply by reason of another person declaring
him to be so. Every person should have the feeling of freedom in
himself, and this will never come to one who has not renounced the
use of foreign cloth.</p>

Japanese saris, French satin and Manchester muslins are but so many
forms of addiction. A person in the grip of these addictions will
never think of freedom, since by his dress he has become a foreigner
who looks upon everything foreign as good, how can we expect such a
man to have the spirit of swadeshi in him? What does such a one know
of self-rule? In what sense can a person who does not like India’s
climate, Indian ways of dressing and Indian dishes look upon the
country as his? The crores of us have not yet come to dislike India’s
climate and are happy enough with its wheat and millet <i>roti</i>,
made with hand, but the cloth it offers fails to please us! Foreign
cloth has cast a spell over us. Till we are free from that spell the
country will remain enslaved, let there be no doubt about it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Foreign cloth, even if anyone offered it free to us, can be of no
benefit to us, in fact it will only harm us; for a man living on
gifts becomes a beggar and a beggar is always a slave; he has sold
his soul.</p>

To be able to enter the temple of swaraj, what we need is swadeshi.
Swadeshi means boycott of foreign cloth. The country has recognized
the power of the spinning-wheel. There is not a single province which
is a stranger to it. Khadi is being woven in every province on some
scale. People have mastered this art.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
However, the spell which foreign cloth has cast over us must break.
Until it has broken, the use of the spinning-wheel will not be
assured. So long as the country has not recognized the magic power of
the spinning-wheel, it will have no strength in its arms and will</p>

acquire no confidence in itself. The auspicious hour when we should
start such boycott has arrived.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I shall be put to shame if by October 1 we have not won swaraj and my
faith in India will be proved to have been misplaced. If we do not
get it by December, India will have failed in her pledge, she will
have lost face in the eyes of the world and the delegates who
attended [the Congress] at Nagpur will be proved to have been no
worthy delegates.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
We cannot get swaraj unless we boycott foreign cloth. Through such
boycott we clean our bodies and, till we have cleaned ourselves so,
we are not fit to chant the swaraj <i>mantra</i>.</p>

If, therefore, we wish to enter the temple of swaraj this year, there
should be no more delay in completing boycott [of foreign cloth],
since, by adopting swadeshi, we shall come into possession of an
unrivalled source of strength. If those who have usurped the temple
fail to understand our strength even then and refuse to give up
possession, we shall have no choice but to give them a fight. Some
time is bound to elapse in this. I am confident, however, that we
shall not need to fight if we carry out complete boycott of foreign
cloth, that we shall get possession of what is ours.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
Nonetheless, we should allow for some time for the struggle. If,
therefore, we want to have swaraj in October, we should complete the
boycott by August 31. We shall know on August 1 whether we shall
succeed in doing so. The death anniversary of Tilak Maharaj falls on
that day. We may celebrate the day with zest if we have completed our
task by that time but, if we have failed to do our duty, we should in
our shame stay indoors. As it was during the last days of June that
we worked best, so we can strive hard during the remaining days of
this month and complete the boycott of foreign cloth. Everyone who
describes himself as a non-co-operator must wear khadi and nothing
else, and should make do with the fewest clothes. This is a period of
transition, a difficult period. Seeing that immediate boycott is
bound to reduce our stock of cloth and result in shortage of cloth in
the country, we should carry on with fewer clothes. Moreover,
everyone may not be in a position to buy new clothes and so we have
no choice but to make do with fewer clothes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
We may either make a bonfire of foreign cloth in stock with us, or
give it away to be sent to other countries or wear such garments when
visiting the lavatory. Should we be poor, we may use such cloth but,
seeing that it is a symbol of our slavery, only it we can afford no
other course.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
To make things easy for the poor, we should maintain depots for
receiving foreign cloth in exchange for khadi. We should in this way
think out a number of plans and, in so far, at any rate, as our own
dress is concerned, we should totally discard the use of foreign
cloth before August 1. All of us should resolve to buy no more
foreign cloth and to spin a fixed quantity of yarn daily in our
homes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
This will not be enough, however. We should visit every cloth shop.
We should entreat dealers in foreign cloth to stop importing such
cloth and try to see that they dispose of their existing stocks by
sending them to other countries.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
As the consumers and the merchants have their duties, so have the
mill-owners theirs. We should appeal to them not to put up the prices
of cloth in consequence of the boycott. Even as it is, they charge
such high prices that there is room for some reduction. If, now, they
seek to exploit the people’s need and put up the prices, they will
themselves be acting as foreigners and as enemies of the country. I
think they will not go to that length.</p>

We look upon this movement for swaraj as one of self- purification.
We are being tested more and more as we climb higher. If everyone of
us has the spirit of patriotism and desires to keep it undefiled as
he would his own home, I believe it would be the easiest thing to win
swaraj during this year. As the country demonstrated one miracle on
June 30, we have full reason to hope that it will perform the other
miracle of boycott too. May God preserve our honour!</p>

There can be many ways of interpreting <i>yajna</i>. For the Hindu
householder, five <i>yajnas </i>are considered essential : the oven,
the pestle, the quern, the pitcher and the spinning-wheel. The fewer
there are of these the less substantial the household. A glance at
them, however, will show that the important sacrifices are the first
and the last and the middle three are their offshoots. The quern, the
pitcher and the pestle presuppose the oven. The oven would not work
at its best in the absence of the quern or the pestle in a home, but
still it can pull on. But stop the spinning-wheel and you are without
a principal organ. You have paralysis. A man who does no <i>yajna </i>for
his food and clothing has no right to either. There should be a
custom that he who</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.48cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
does not work at his stove must go without food, and he who does not
ply his spinning-wheel must go naked. We have discarded the
spinning-wheel without discarding clothes. He is a thief who wears
clothes without doing any spinning, in the same way that he who
consumes food without working for it is a thief. <i>Yajna </i>means
an offering, a sacrifice of the self, which is what physical labour
is. They who work at the oven and the wheel are engaged in an
intelligent sacrifice. Even those who are not engaged in such
beneficial physical effort have to take some exercise to digest their
food.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
It will perhaps be clear now what a sin we have committed in giving
up the spinning-wheel. India was a happy country, healthy and bright,
when in the past millions of its women used to engage themselves in

has become miserable, diseased and listless.</p>

The oven, the spinning-wheel, etc., are each of them a veritable
grace of the home. If millions of Indian homes are in ruins today, it
is because we gave up the spinning-wheel. Let no one suppose that
this is an exaggeration. It is possible the reader’s own home is
not in that condition. But then a shortage of water does not mean
that no one can get any water. It means everyone has less than
before, many have very little, while some have none at all.
Similarly, many families may be able to carry on without the
spinning-wheel, but some at least have been completely ruined. Look
at Orissa and Champaran. A number of villages there are ruined. What
else would happen to a country whose people, 150 years ago, had some
work or other all the year round, but 80 per cent of whom today are
unemployed for four months in the year?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Work alone is real wealth, metal is a mere token for it. When 80 per
cent of a people are unemployed for four months, their earning
capacity is reduced by one-third. Despite the capacity and
willingness to earn Rs. 3, Indians have for years been working to
earn no more than Rs. 2. They cannot find work for more than that.
How could such a country help being poor? The only remedy for such a
state of affairs is a vow to wear khadi made from yarn spun with our
own hands. Then we shall take to the spinning-wheel, willy-nilly, 
and realize finally that we had made a mistake in giving it up. But,
in the meantime we ought to undrtake a determined effort to
popularize it. We shall never be eager to introduce the
spinning-wheel, nor, after introducing it, shall we be keen to ply
it, so  long as we continue to be  as fond of foreign cloth as we
are. A vow to discard foreign cloth will compel us to use the
spinning-wheel. Thus the spinning-wheel and boycott of foreign cloth
are closely inter-related. We hardly care for a</p>

thing that is not a necessity. It is, therefore, our sacred duty to
see that the spinning-wheel becomes a necessity. There is no other
way of eradicating India’s poverty. For the mistake of giving  up 
so  invaluable a thing, there can be no adequate atonement. A small
sacrifice may be enough if we make it on our own. If we are to do
things under compulsion, who can say what they will be?</p>

There is only a half-truth in what the correspondent says. Of course
I wish to win over my opponents, but not by saying something in which

Jallianwala Bagh out of love.” To me, at any rate, this argument
seems to proceed from sheer ignorance. A father is often angry with
his son because he loves him, but General Dyer’s anger was entirely
the result of hatred. It is clear enough why I take the anger of the

of my other actions. On the question of untouchability, however, they
think I am in the wrong and are angry with me for what they take to
be my error. They do not write to others who violate established
practices, or express indignation over their conduct. We can cite
numerous other instances to prove this. I request my correspondent to
think again.</p>

I have been drawn here by the hope that many of you will take the
pledge of boycotting foreign cloth. I have given reasons why this
should be done. Whether or not millowners or foreign cloth dealers
help us, the people of India can boycott foreign cloth if they so
decide. Boycotting foreign cloth means that the country should stop
using cloth imported from foreign countries. Your merely taking a
pledge not to use foreign cloth hereafter will not satisfy me. We
ought not to use even the foreign cloth which is already with us. I
have considered three courses of which we may adopt any one for this
purpose. The best thing is to burn whatever foreign cloth we have.
Concerning this, many people ask me why we should not give this cloth
to the large number of poor people in our country who wander about
hungry and naked. They say that burning the cloth will be an act of
hatred. My reply is that people’s hatred will be intensified only
if I am actuated by hatred in asking them to burn foreign cloth. If,
however, we realize that we have committed a grave error in taking to
the use of foreign cloth, then our deliverance from slavery lies in
burning it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The second course is to send such cloth to other countries. In our
own country, we cannot give it in charity even to the poorest of the
poor or the most wretched. I place liquor and foreign cloth in the
same category. I know that you find it difficult to cultivate dislike
of foreign cloth. I have been holding these views for a very long
time and so I do not find the thing difficult, whereas you are called
upon to change your ideas in a very short time. If it is your view
that foreign cloth should be disposed of only by sending it to other
countries, you should send the entire stock to me. It will be
disposed of as desired by you. If you believe that boycott of foreign
cloth will not increase hatred but will strengthen our spirit, that
it will strengthen India’s determination, then I should certainly
like a bonfire to such cloth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Arrangements are being made to give khadi in exchange for foreign
cloth to those who are too poor to buy swadeshi cloth. We have at
present two varieties of swadeshi cloth, mill cloth and hand- spun
khadi. For us the only cloth is khadi, mill cloth should be</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
reserved for the poor. Some persons, being slaves to pleasure and
comfort, do not like to wear khadi; they feel an aversion to it. But
till you are able to make this sacrifice, it will be impossible to
end our slavery. If you cannot bring yourself to wear khadi, use mill
cloth. If at all you take a pledge, it must be to wear khadi
exclusively. There is khadi worth Rs. 10, 000 in the Khadi Bhandar at
Kalbadevi and it is selling. I discussed the matter with Shri
Narandas Purushottam today and, in a few days, khadi worth and less
than Rs. 50, 000 will arrive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Do not use more khadi than necessary. The country is not in a
position to supply as much as people may want. Khadi should be used
as economically as ghee and gold. We should indulge in no 
ostentation so long as we do not have swaraj. The men should have two
long shirts and a dhoti each and the women, too, should make do with
a few clothes. A friend has said that we should be ready even for
hanging, but you will not have to mount the gallows. If the country
gets ready for this, we should have swaraj right today. When such a
time comes, though, I shall not need to tell you to boycott foreign
cloth. At present there is no strength left in us. Some sisters
complain that they find it difficult to part with Japanese saris and
French silks and to start wearing khadi. But doing this is the test
of whether or not we have acquired real strength. Some say that you
have given money only for my sake and that the people have not made
genuine sacrifices. This too you can disprove by giving up foreign
cloth.</p>

over these things and he felt much for the liquor merchants who were
earning their livelihood by means of selling liquor to the people.
Mr. B. F. Bharucha had supplied him with facts and figures in this
regard and many Parsi brethren had also written to him both
anonymously and in their own names; he knew from all these what the
actual position in the city was with regard to this trade. He wished
to tell them that, even if there were only a dozen or so bad men
among the small Parsi community of 80,000, they would hurt it while,
even if there were five or seven lakhs among the Hindus and Muslims
they would not be so glaringly prominent. That was always the case in
the world. So, while the few Parsi liquor shop-keepers had come into
notoriety, others were forgotton; the example of the Parsi
liquor-dealers was very prominently before the country. At the
Excelsior Theatre he had told his Parsi friends that they would be
able to set an example to the whole country by their noble conduct.
Therefore, he was deeply sorry that so many people among the Parsis
were earning their livelihood by selling liquor to the public and he
thought it was a great discredit to them. He was also sorry that so
many widows had to maintain themselves by selling liquor. In his
opinion it was better for these women to break stones or even beg
their food than to sell liquor to the people.</font></font></p>

he had the means of a Petit or a Tata, he would have fallen at the
feel of these Parsi widows and begged of them to give up this trade
and take as much money as they liked. He would have been too glad to
look after them. If he had any money at his disposal the first use he
would make of it would be to offer it to his Parsi sisters and
brothers and ask them to give up this liquor trade. Some of his Parsi
friends had told him that they could not give up their daily glass of
liquor; some had told him that the Parsi religion prohibited
drinking, while others had told him that the Parsi religion permitted
them to drink liquor. His heart, however, was full of sorrow for his
Parsi sisters whether their religion permitted drinking or not. If
the poison of liquor- selling continued long, it was enough to
destroy a small community like theirs.</font></font></p>

Mr. Mahomed Nawezkhan, B. A., LL.B., of Bannu, writes a long letter
on my appeal to the Frontier friends. I propose to give a brief
summary of it instead of reproducing the whole letter, which is too
discursive for the columns of <i>Young India. </i>He thinks that the
tribesmen who learn the message will gladly respond. He traces the
history of the annexation of the territory of the tribesmen, and
proves that, before these territories were annexed, there were
practically no raids. Moreover, all were equally armed and,
therefore, the raided parties were well able to take care of
themselves. But after annexation, the tribesmen who were wantonly
robbed of their lands treated both the Hindu and the Mussul-man
inhabitants of the annexed territories as their enemies, the more so
as the latter helped the Government in subduing the tribesmen. The
writer, who claims an intimate acquain- tance with the situation, is
of opinion that the tribesmen have been no respecters of religions,
and have subjected to their depredations the Hindus and the
Mussulmans alike, and that Mussulmans have never been known to assist
the Hindus against the raiders. In proof of impartiality, the writer
instance the cordial treatment meted out to the Hindus in the
independent territory of the Frontier tribes. He states that the
Hindus living there have greater freedom of worship than even in the
British territory. Their social status is any day better than under
the British Government, and the Maliks<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>are
ever ready with all their might to defend their Hindu friends living
within their jurisdic- tion. The writer gives it as his judgment that
the British Government in the Frontier Province has sinfully
abdicated its function of protecting the inhabitants, who have
unfortunately come under the so-called protecting wing of the British
Empire. He winds up his  letter  by saying that the Frontier
regulations are worth studying, the procedure there is most
arbitrary, and the life and property of the people are at the mercy
of military officers who are incapable of giving judicial decisions.
Extra Assistant Commissioners, he says, in effect disgrace their
commi-ssions and become instruments of injustice and oppre- ssion. No
man’s honour is safe in the hands of these administra-</p>

attention must have been drawn to statements made by Maulanas Mahomed
Ali and Shaukat Ali that, if no settlement is arrived at before
Christmas regarding our campaign, an Indian republic will be declared
at the Ahmedabad session of the Congress. Special importance attaches
to this statement as it is not made by an irresponsible person but by
responsible leaders like the Maulanas. It is felt, however, that the
statement is both unfortunate and premature, and is likely to come in
the way of the programme laid down for the country by the Congress.
The country as a whole has responded magnificenlty to the appeal of
the Congress, and is prepared, excepting certain sections, to work
for the attainment of swaraj. I would ask you to give your views
regarding the Maulanas’ statement, and to assure the public that no
departure from the policy of non-violent non-co-operation accepted by
the Congress will be made.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I am sorry to have to confess that I have not seen the Mau- lanas’
declaration, but I have no hesitation in giving the assurance that no
stone will be left unturned by me to prevent a departure even by a
hair’s breadth from the policy of non-violent non-co-operation that
has been deliberately adopted by the country. Nor do I entertain the
slightest fear of any departure from that policy on the part of the
Brothers. I have however no difficulty about understanding the
Maulanas, mind. They are quite capable of saying that if India does
not get the relief she demands in the matters of the Punjab and the
Khilafat she will at the next session of the Congress make a decla-
ration of indepen-dence. Swaraj within the Empire is a possibility
only if England washes her hands clean of the taint of the Khilafat
breach and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The Congress creed has been
purposely made elastic enough to admit of a demand for indepen-
dence. To go no further, the Maulanas have, after all, if they have,
but reiterated the opinion pronounced by Mr. Andrews, who, unlike me,
considers that there is no room in the British Empire for a self-
respecting and self-governing India, and who expects that some day I
shall myself be driven to that position. I am differently
constituted. I never give up hope so long as there is the least
chance, and I have faith enough in the British people to feel that
whilst they will test our determination and strength to the
uttermost, they will not carry it to</p>

the breaking point. They are too self-conscious to part with an India
awakened and strong for the sake of shielding Dyerism and O’Dwyer-
ism and of the questionable advantage of Greek friendship. The Non-
conformist conscience, which is ignorantly hostile to the just
aspirations of the brave Turks, will prove yielding under the Indian
strain which is daily gathering force. Long before the Congress
meets, if India proves true to herself, I look forward—not to a
Declaration of Independence—but to an honourable settlement that
will satisfy the just demand of India re the Punjab and the Khilafat,
and that will assure to her full immediate swaraj in accordance with
the wishes of her chosen representatives. Let the reader, however,
not run away with the idea that my forecast is based upon any
knowledge of what is going on in Simla or Whitehall. I base it upon
my profound belief in the ability of India during the next three
months to assert herself, i.e., in the ability of India to carry out
an almost complete boycott of foreign cloth, and by still greater
self-restraint to prove her ability to adopt civil disobedience of a
very stern character.</p>

I am not, however, blind to the difficulties that bestrew our path.

have seen the official version and the other in the <i>Independent. </i>I
shall apologize to the people of Aligarh if I find that I am in the
wrong, but the <i>Independent </i>corres- pondent’s version is
evasive and attempts to prove too much. It does not deny incendiarism
on the part of the mob, and seeks entirely to exculpate the latter. I
shall require overwhelmingly strong evidence to prove that the
authorities in Aligarh acted wantonly and maliciously without the
slightest provocation. I am quite prepared to find that the Police
wanted to prevent an aggressive demonstration on the part of the mob,
and that in so doing, they lost self-restraint and opened fire. My
point, however, is that there should be no aggressiveness on our part
at all. Non-co-operators must not bully or threaten. We are
developing quite an irresistible courage which comes only from
waiting upon God, in other words, from absolute faith in the righte-
ousness of our cause. If we want to finish our programme success-
fully, and during this year, we have no time for bluster or a show of
force. We must be scrupulously truthful to our pledge.  We  can
succeed beyond all expectation only if we remain nonviolent in
thought, word and deed. It need not be our final creed, but it must

our present creed for the attainment of our goal. There need be no
difficulty in our not thinking or speaking ill of our adversary, as
we have found it easy enough on the whole to restrain ourselves from
doing ill to him. We must not use the pledge of non-violence and
truth to cover violence and exaggeration, if not untruth. Nor must we
be afraid to let our best comrades go to jail. I adhere to the
belief, so often expressed by me, that Pandit Sunderlal and now
Pandit Makhanlal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>are
serving the community better being in jail for the sake of conscience
than they would have being free. Those who think otherwise, in my
opinion, do not understand the dynamics of non-co- operation. The
dynamic force behind this great movement is not vocal propaganda but
the silent propaganda carried on by the sufferings of the innocent
victims of a mad Government.</p>

A few days before Pandit Sundarlal was arrested, he wrote to me a
long letter. I give below a free translation of the relevant part of
it. The whole of it appeared to me to be natural and frank. Needless
to say, it was written purely for my own edification.</p>

The <i>Zemindar </i>of Lahore, edited by Mr. Jafar Ali Khan up to the
time of his incarceration and now edited by his son, is, I
understand, threatened with prosecution. The editor has been asked to
tender an un-truthful apology if he wishes to avoid a prosecution. He
has been asked to withdraw certain statements made by him which he
himself believes. One of them is the reported bombardment of Najef.
He has copied the information from other papers. Thousands of
Mussulmans believe in the bombardment. He has assured the Government
that if responsible independent Mussulmans went to the spot and
investigated the matter and denied the truth of the bombardment, he
would be prepared to withdraw the statement. One would imagine that
the offer was perfectly honourable. He has published a spirited poem,
some of whose lines can be interpreted as incitement to violence.  He
 has offered as a non-co-operator to apologize for those lines, not
because he fears prose-cution but because he does not want to place
himself in a false position regarding his creed of non-violence. The
third statement objected to by the Goverment has reference to the
report of and commentary upon a case in Bengal, wherein a European 
is reported to have killed a <i>khansama </i>and to have been fined
Rs. 300 by the court. The comment objected to is the British courts
give licence to Europeans to kill Indians for Rs. 300 as a fine. The
comment is no doubt severe, but there is cer-tainly no incite-ment to
violence in it, and it is not unjustified by the several
mis-carriages of justice recently reported in the Press. The
Government have no notion how deep the belief has sunk in the Indian
mind that even-handed justice as between Europeans and Indians is
almost an impossibility. The fourth charge against the <i>Zemindar </i>is
the reproduction of Maulana Mahomed Ali’s statement regarding the
Afghan bogey. This idea of asking for apologies from editors and
public men under threat of prosecution is a parody of the apology of
the Ali Bro-thers. For the U. P. Govern- ment have been trying the
same thing upon the editor of the <i>Indepe- </i><i>ndent </i>and
others. I do not know what has happened in Allahabad as a result of
the Government’s unseemly effort to obtain apologies from
self-respecting non-co-operators. The more straight forward and
honourable course would be to send to jail all the non-co-operators
whom the Government do not like. Let them not move from the Punjab
type of humiliation to the subtler type in the shape of abject</p>

It is no small thing for the country that Dwijendranath Tagore,
fondly known as Bada Dada by his friends, follows with keen attention
even in his old age and in his seclusion at Shantiniketan all that is
going on in the country. Mr. Andrews has circulated a free
translation of his latest thoughts on non-co-operation. Although the
whole of it is publi-shed in the daily Press, I cannot resist
reproducing his defini- tions of co-operation and non-co-operation;
they are so true and telling. Writing of the former he says:</p>

speedy closing of all the liquor shops within its jurisdiction, it
will have covered itself with glory, and will have rendered a signal

copied by other members and councillors throughout India. A
simultaneous move on the part of local boards and municipalities all
over India will strengthen the hands of reformers all over, will
force the hand of the Government and is, there-fore, likely to
obviate all danger of violence which a three-cornered tussle between
pickets, the police and the publicans is likely to precipitate.</p>

The refusal of the Magistrate of Bijnor District of renew the fire-
arms licence in favour of the Assistant Governor of Kangri Gurukul,
brought to light by Swami Shraddhanand, is an eloquent demons-
tration of the utter futility of the Reforms. If Swami Shraddhanand’s
guess that the refusal is due to his having been prominently
identified with non-co-operation turns out to be true, it will show
that, in things affecting the daily life of the people, there is
absolutely no change in the methods of administration or the conduct
of officials except such as has been compelled by the pressure of
non-co-operation. But the public were hardly prepared for the callous
indifference of the District Magistrate of Bijnor in respect of a
citizen of the known standing of Swami Shraddha-nand. I have
characterized the indifference  as callous, because the gun sought to
be licensed was required not for the purposes of sport but of
self-defence in the midst of a jungle infested with wild beasts.</p>

I have already adverted to the prosecution and conviction of Pandit
Makhanlal Chaturvedi. I have just received a copy of his statement
before the court. He refused to defend himself by leading evidence or
otherwise, but made his statement before the court with merely a
reiteration of his creed of non-violence. The reader, however, will
be startled, as I was, to find that, if Pandit Makhanlal’s
statement</p>

may be relied upon, he was prosecuted in reality not for what was his
actual offence in the estimation of the Government, but for an in
offensive speech. The following is the part of the statement I have
in mind. From it one can see that when the prosecution was decided
upon, Makhanlalji had not spoken at all.</p>

have been the editor of the </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><i>Karmavir
</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">published from
Jabalpur. In the course of my journalistic duties, I have had
occasions to ventilate many public grievances and to criticize
several administrative measures in the province. The district
administration of Narsinhpur had fallen into disrepute, and it became
a matter of duty fearlessly to expose in the columns of my paper the
scandals connected with the administration of Mr. J. C. Bourne, the
Deputy Commissioner. The local official there systematically
tyrannized over the people, and as was stated in the Legislative
Council, ‘a body of police force had invaded a village, tortured
the people, spat at their faces, kicked them with their shoes,
arrested and maltreated them, starved them for a number of days and
lastly violated the honour of women.’ As a result of the exposure,
I have become the object of Govern-ment wrath, and it is not at all
surprising to me that the C. P. Government should prosecute me for a
speech made at the Bilaspur Conference on the 12th of March 1921,
when the Home Member of the Government publicly announced on the 4th
of March in the Central Provinces Legislative Council that my
prosecution was already awaiting the sanction of the Government. I
venture to state that, if I had not fearlessly exposed the corrupt
character of the Bourne regime at Narsinhpur, this prosecution would
not have been launched. I admit to having made a speech at the
Bilaspur District Conference on the 12th March, but assert that the
speech as reported by the Government reporters neither represents my
views nor is an honest and correct report of what I spoke at the
meeting. I am a strict and loyal adherent of the non-violent
non-co-operation creed of the Indian National Congress, and have
honestly worked within the letter and the spirit of the resolution as
passed at the Nagpur session.</font></font></p>

do not know whether there is any truth in the charges against the
Narsinhpur administration. But there is certainly something very 
wrong some-where.</p>

after all imperfect instruments, working for their fulfilment. I
would there- fore urge, with all the strength at my command,
enthusiasts or enter- prising business men to observe some sense of

rumours seem to have been set afloat by some of my opponents. The
school was started by me in November last, one month after I had
non-co-operated. Not being able to secure assistance from the
Khilafat Committee, I depended upon individual support. A new school
wants some time to put itself on its on its legs. But in the case of
my school, I began at the very start to hear rumours about my “fat
salary”, although the plain fact is, not only that I have drawn no
salary as yet, but that there is a deficit of about Rs. 1,200 up to
the 31st of May, 1921. As regards finance, the school has a financial
board with Mr. Durgadas B. Advani as Chairman. The board met, and the
accounts, duly audited by a professional accountant appointed by the
Committee, have been passed and a statement of accounts will be

oppression breaking out. If the Utkal people were strong and
organized, I would have no hesitation in asking them to enter these
so- called State territories, break through every one of the inhuman
restrictions and invite all the penalties of the law. But I fear that
the time is not yet. We must learn much greater self-restraint than
we have up to now. What we have already cultivated is hopeful, but
more is undoubtedly needed.</p>

His Excellency the Viceroy in his reply to the Liberal League
Deputation from the United Provinces delivered and address which was
more cautious than his reply to the Ahmadiyya Deputation.
Never-theless, it is necessary to remind His Excellency that in it he
has asked India to do the impossible. Liberals and Nationalists,
co-ope- rators and non-co-operators, Hindus, Mussulmans, Sikhs,
Jains, Parsis, Christians, Jews and all who call themselves Indians
insist, each in his own way, upon the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs
being righted. His Excellency is still pressing the Khilafat claim.
That is hopeful, in that he does not ask the Mussulmans of India and
their Hindu and other countrymen to forget the Khilafat wrong. But he
clearly asks us to forget the Punjab wrong. The task is as impossible
as it would be for a physician to make a patient forget—except
under the temporary influence of some stupefying drug—his painful
disease. The Punjab wrong is like a running sore, and even as a
running sore cannot be healed unless the whole of the poison is
removed, so can the Punjab wrong not be forgotten and forgiven unless
and until the poison in the shape of pensions to and continued
employment of unrepentant and faithless servants has been removed.
Does Lord Reading imagine that India is reconciled to the translation
of Mr. Thomson to a higher post? He asks us to give him and his
Government credit for sincerity and honesty of purpose. He may have
that credit, but there arises immediately upon the grant of that
credit the belief that there is a fundamental difference between the
Govern-ment’s and the people’s outlook upon vital matters. And so
long as Lord Reading and his Government continue, be it ever so
sincerely, to ask India to be recon- ciled to the retention on the
pension list or on the service list of the names of those who have,
from an Indian standpoint, proved</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
unworthy of the trust reposed in them, so long there can be no meet-
ing-ground between the Government and the people. If we have even a
semblance of respons-ibility given to us, surely we must have the
right to dismiss from service those who have atrociously wronged us.
To me it is a supreme test of responsibility—the righting of the
two wrongs. The injustice of the Khilafat wrong is admitted. The
atrocity in the Punjab is written in letters of blood. We admit that
we did wrong in Amritsar, in Kasur, in Jallian-wala and in
Gujaranwala. We have been made to pay for it heavily. We have been
humiliated, kicked. Both the innocent and the guilty have been
hanged. We have ourselves made a frank, free and open confession from
many a platform. We ask for no humiliation of official wrongdoers.
All we ask is that they may not be imposed upon us as masters. And
English official once frankly told me that rather than be party, by
remaining in the service, to the removal from the pension list of Sir
Michael O’Dwyer or General Dyer, he would resign. I told him that,
whilst I could see my way to sympathize with such an attitude, he
must not expect me to agree with him. Nor did he. Hundreds, if not
thousands, of English- men and Englishwomen consider Sir Michael
O’Dwyer and General Dyer as sav-iours of the Empire and the honour
of their kind. It is highly likely that, if I were an Englishman
intent upon holding India at any cost, I would feel even as they. But
I hold that, so long as attitude is retained, so long must
co-operation between the Govern- ment and the people be impossible.
Non-co-operation alone can open the eyes of Englishmen to the fact
that co-operation with them in the Government of the country involves
an acceptance of their attitude. But it is inconsistent with their
position as friends and associates. They may not remain in India on
the Strength of their bayonets. They can remain only on the strength
of our goodwill. That and that alone must be the binding force
between them and us. Let them not mock us by professing equality on
the lips and by maintaining behind their entrenchments an
unassailable superiority. As a shrewd man of the world, Lord Reading,
I hope, will soon recognize the impossibility of reconciling two
opposite attitudes. Had there been a middle course, non-co-operators
would have adopted it long ago. It is not a question of hatred or
ill-will on the part of the vast mass of people. I invite him to
drive the probe deep enough, and he would find that weak as we are,
we can no longer tolerate the cult of white superiority. Lip
professions, well meaning and sincere though they may be, can serve
no useful purpose. We are idolatrous enough to demand ocular proof</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 5%"><br/>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
of equality. Does he not see that the existence of white soldiers may
be a necessity for the safety of Englishmen, never for the safety of
the Indian Border? Englishmen must be prepared to live in India
precisely on the same terms as the Parsis. A mere handful of the
latter have remained for the last thousand years as honoured friends
and partners. They have needed no special protection, no fort to
retire to in times of danger from enraged Hindus or Mussulmans. Have
not the followers of Moses and Jesus the faith of those of Zoroaster?
The plain fact is that Englishmen are not prepared to remain in India
on the sufferance of the millions of Hindus and Mussulmans. The
latter are not prepared to give the former any advantageous position
by reagon of their controlling all the most destructive appliances
that human ingenuity has ever invented. There is no choice before the
latter but that of making a supreme effort to neutralize the effect
of all those appliances by ceasing to fear them, i.e., by
non-resistance. This may all appear to be arrogant or visionary. I
hope, however, that Lord Reading at any rate will soon find that I
have spoken the real mind of India. And the sooner this fundamental
truth is realized, the sooner will there be real hearty co-operation
between Englishmen  and Indians. I am longing for such co-operation,
and it is  this  very  longing which deters me from accepting any
apology, no matter how tempting, for co-operation. Non-co-operation
is not born of igno- rance and ill will, but it is the only effective
step towards co-operation, and therefore it rises from knowledge and
love.</p>

I cannot prove my honesty, if you do not feel it. Some of my Indian
friends charge me with camouflage when I say we need not hate
Englishmen whilst we may hate the system they have established.  I am
trying to show them that one may detest the wickedness of a brother
without hating him. Jesus denounced the wickedness of the Scribes and
the Pharises, but he did not hate them. He did not enunciate this law
of love for the man and hate for the evil in him for himself only,
but he taught the doctrine for universal practice. Indeed, I find it
in all the scriptures of the world.</p>

I claim to be a fairly accurate student of human nature and
vivisector of my own failings. I have discovered than man is superior
to the system he propounds. And so I feel that you as an individual
are infinitely better than the system you have evolved  as  a
corporation. Each one of my countrymen in Amritsar on that fateful
10th of April was better than the crowd of which he was a member. He,
as a man, would have declined to kill those innocent English bank
managers. But in that crowd, many a man forgot himself. Hence it is
that an Englishman in office is different from an Englishman outside.
Similarly, an Englishman in India is different from an Englishman in
England. Here in India, you belong to a system that is vile beyond
description. It is possible, therefore, for me to condemn the system
in the strongest terms, without considering you to be bad and without
imputing bad motives to every Englishman. You are as much slaves of
the system as we are. I want you, therefore, to reciprocate, and not
impute to me motives which you cannot read in the written word. I
give you the whole of my motive when I tell you that I am impatient
to end or mend a system, which has made India subservient to a
handful of you and which has made Englishmen feel secure only in the

The Lancashire cloth, as English historians have shown, was forced
upon India, and her own world-famed manufactures were delib-erately
and systematically ruined. India is, therefore,  at  the mercy not
only of Lanca-shire but also of Japan, France and America. Just see
what this has meant to India. We send out of India every year sixty
crores (more or less) of rupees for cloth. We grow enough  cotton for
our own cloth. Is it no mad-ness to send cotton outside India, and
have it manufactured into cloth there and shipped to us? Was it right
to reduce India to such a helpless state?</p>

A hundred and fifty years ago, we manufactured all our cloth. Our
women spun fine yarn in their own cottages, and supplemented the
earnings of their husbands. The village weavers wove that yarn. It
was an indispensable part of national economy in a vast agricultural
country like ours. It enabled us in a most natural manner to utilize
our leisure. Today our women have lost the cunning of their hands,
and the enforced idleness of millions has impoverished the land. Many
weavers have become sweepers. Some have taken to the profession of
hired soldiers. Half the race of artistic weavers has died out, and
the other half is weaving imported foreign yarn for want of finer
hand- spun yarn.</p>

You will perhaps now understand what boycott of foreign cloth means
to India. It is not devised as a punishment. If the Government were
today to redress the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs and consent to
India attaining immediate swaraj, the boycott movement must still
continue. Swaraj means at least the power to conserve Indian indus-
tries that are vital to the economic existence of the nation, and to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
prohibit such imports as may interfere with such existence. Agricul-
ture and hand-spinning are the two lungs of the national body. They
must be protected against consumption at any cost.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
This matter does not admit of any waiting. The interests of the
foreign manufacturers and the Indian importers cannot be considered
when the whole nation is starving for want of a large productive
occupation ancillary to agriculture.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
You will not mistake this for a movement of general boycott of
foreign goods. India does not wish to shut herself out of
international commerce . Things other than cloth which can be better
made outside India she must gratefully receive upon terms
advantageous to the con- tracting parties. Nothing can be forced upon
her. But I do not wish to peep into the future. I am certainly hoping
that before long it would be possible for India to co-operate with
England on equal terms. Then will be the time for examining trade
relations. For the time being, I bespeak your help in bringing about
a boycott of foreign cloth.</p>

Of similar and equal improtance is the campaign against drink. The
liquor shops are an insufferable curse imposed upon society. There
never was so much awakening among the people as now upon this
question. I admit that, here, it is the Indian ministers who can help
more than you can. But I would like you to speak out your mind
clearly on the question. Under every system of government, total
prohibition, so far as I can see, will be insisted upon by the
nation. You can assist the growth of the everrising agitation by
throwing in the weight of your influence on the side of the nation.</p>

habit of writing anonymously. We who are developing the swaraj spirit
must cultivate the courage of fearlessly speaking out our mind. The
subject-matter of the letter, however, being of public importance,
demands a reply. I cannot claim the honour of being a follower of the
late Lokamanya. I admire him like millions of his countrymen for his
indomitable will, his vast learning, his love of country, and above
all, the purity of his private life and great sacrifice. Of all the
men of modern times, he captivated most the imagination of his
people. He breathed into us the spirit of swaraj. No one perhaps
realized the evil of the existing system of Government as Mr. Tilak
did. And, in all humility, I claim to deliver his message to the
country as truly as the best of his disciples. But I am conscious
that my method is not Mr. Tilak’s method. And that is why I have
still difficulty with some of the Maharashtra leaders. But I
sincerely think that Mr. Tilak did not disbelieve in my method. I
enjoyed the privilege of his confidence. And his last word to me in
the presence of several friends was, just a fortnight before his
death that mine was an excellent method if the people could be
persuaded to take to it. But he said he had doubts. I know no other
method. I can only hope that, when the final test comes, the country
will be proved to have assimilated the method of non-violent
non-co-operation. Nor am I unaware of my other limitations. I can lay
no claim to scholarship. I have not his powers of organization, I
have no compact disciplined party to lead, and having been an exile
for twenty-three years, I cannot claim the experience that the
Lokamanya had of India. Two things we had in common to the fullest
measure—love of country and the steady pursuit of swaraj. I can,
therefore, assure the anonymous writer that, yielding to none in my
reverence for the memory of the deceased I will march side by side
with the foremost of the Lokamanya’s disciples in the pursuit of
swaraj. I know that the only offering acceptable to him is the
quickest attainment of swaraj by India. That and nothing else can
give his spirit peace.</p>

a mother after a long separation. His gentle face put me at ease in a

moment Gokhale never lost sight of me. In 1901 on my second return
from South Africa, we came closer still<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

 He  simply  ‘took  me  in hand’, and began to fashion me. He was
concerned about how I spoke, dressed, walked and ate. My mother was
not more solicitous about me than Gokhale. There was, so far as I am
aware, no reserve between us. It was really a case of love at first
sight, and it stood the severest strain in 1913<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. He seemed to me all I wanted as a political
worker—pure as crystal, gentle as a lamb, brave as a lion and
chivalrous to a fault. It does not matter to me that he may not have
been any of these things. It was enough for me that I could discover
no fault in him to cavil at. He was and remains for me the most
perfect man in the political field. Not, therefore, that we had no
difference. We differed even in 1901 in our views on social customs,
e.g., widow remarriage. We discovered differe-nces in our estimate of
Western civilization. He frankly differed from me in my extreme views
on non-violence. But these differences mattered neither to him nor to
me. Nothing could put us asunder. It were blasphemous to conjecture
what would have happened if he were alive today. I know that I would
have been working under him. I have made this confession because the
anonymous letter hurt me when it accused me of imposture about my
political discipleship. Had I been remiss in my acknowledgment to him
who is now dumb ? I thought I must declare my faithfulness to
Gokhale, especially when I seemed to be living in a camp which the
Indian world calls opposite.</p>

I have been following the doings of Government in Dharwar with the
keenest interest. I tender my congratulations to the relatives of the
victims of the official tyranny and I congratulate the people in
general upon their patience and fortitude. It has given me great
pleasure to learn that the arrests have not demoralized the citizens
of Dharwar. I have no doubt that incidents like the one at Dharwar
will accelerate our march to-wards swaraj if only we retain our
patience and the spirit of non-violence. Deliberate and intentional
non-retalia- tion doubles the courage of the people and adds greater
sanctity to the cause they espouse. Undeterred, therefore, by the
official repression, we must pursue our goal. I understand that the
problem in Darwar is complicated by local dissensions and feuds. I
urge all to forget these in face of the common danger but if all do
not respond, I shall cer- tainly expect non-co-operators to do so.
But quietly resigning them- selves to whatever jealousies they may be
subjected to, they will disarm their opponents. <i>There </i><i>is no
</i><i>better remedy </i><i>to </i><i>overcome </i><i>opposition </i><i>than

Tell Manibehn or Dahyabhai that I had again a long talk with
Vithalbhai. I think he understands the importance of the spinning-
wheel a little better now. I do feel that his proper field is the
Councils. He cannot go among the people, mix with them and serve
them. It is not as if he did not want to serve. Only he has not
trained himself to do so. He has trained himself for the other work.
It seems to me that the two kinds of work require different
aptitudes. I have come across no one in Bombay who speaks ill of
Vithalbhai.</p>

There should be no hartal anywhere in India on August 1, when the
death anniversary of Lokamanya Tilak falls. The people should rather
rejoice on that day, confident that our strength is increasing and
that we are moving faster towards our goal. It will be far from

Congress workers must foster among people a love for swadeshi. Till a
complete boycott of foreign cloth is achieved, they should encourage
people in boycott and it should be their first duty  to produce
khaddar. During the transition period, we should make do with half
the cloth we need, otherwise we shall have to suffer a steep rise in
the price of cloth and great scarcity. So long as the charkha does
not ply in every home and all weavers do not use hand-spun yarn, we
should be sparing, like a miser, in using swadeshi cloth.</p>

As a committee appointed to deal with non-co-operation matters only,
we have no authority to consider any means outside non-co-
opera-tion. But the success already achieved by the non-violent non-
co-operation movement makes it unnecessary, in our opinion, to
consider any means outside it. When, at the end of this month the
results of the pursuits of the Bezwada programme of the Congress are
tabulated, we shall be in a still better position to gause the
success of non-co-operation, and to take, in consultation with the
All-India Congress Committee, which meets at Lucknow on 22nd July,
such steps as the situation may warrant.</p>

In so far as non-co-operation is concerned, it is obvious that every
further step to be taken must be determined by the condition of the
people of India. It has already been suggested that the progress made
in the last three months justifies the advisability of having
recourse to civil disobedience, The disregard of Muslim and Indian
opinion once more displayed by the Government of Britain in the
matter of their attitude towards the Turks coupled with the  gross
misuse of law in India in order to suppress the non-co-operation
movement in spite of its non-violence may force us to adopt civil
disobedience at an early date. However, since the All-India Congress

ought to stimulate the people, and particularly the Mussulmans, to
great exertion in regard to the programme already before the country,
i.e., in respect of titles, councils, schools and colleges, law

Above all, we desire to place on record our conviction that a greater
effort is necessary to carry out the Bezwada programme, if we are
successfully to cope with what appears to be the undoubtedly hostile
attitude of the British Government towards the  Turks  and Islam. No
adult Indian, male or female, should delay in registering hir or her
name in the Congress register or contributing to the Tilak Swaraj
Fund. We consider the introduction of the spinning-wheel in every
home, the universal use of khaddar, and the complete boycott of
foreign cloths as indispensable for the attainment of our end, along
with the enlistment of all people and particularly the Mussulmans, as
members of the Khilafat Committee and their contributing liberally
for the sufferers from Smyrna, who must  otherwise  constitute  a
terrible drain on the already reduced resources of the Turkish
Government of Angora.</p>

We therefore urge redoubled efforts in these directions and expect
response commensurate in its readiness with the gravity and urgency
of the situation. We have taken not of the universal feeling of
indignation produced by the news that Britain was contemplating
further hostile action against Turkey and consider that it is our
duty to direct this feeling into channels productive of the greatest
good, so that India may attain all the sooner the greater purpose of
redressing the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs and the crowning
achievement of swaraj which it has set before itself. The goal is not
distant, but still the greatest effort is needed to reach it before
Turkey is irretrievably weakened. This apprehension alone should stir
every Mussulman to exertion in behalf of fulfilment of the
non-co-operation programme.</p>

being burnt, should be given away to the poor or exported to other
countries. After weighing all the arguments, I still feel that
foreign cloth should be thrown into the fire. If we look upon the use
of foreign cloth as sinful, if we believe that its use has
impoverished the country, that because of it countless numbers of our
sisters have been rendered homeless, we should look upon foreign
cloth as so much dirt and, just as we would not pass on to others the
dirt on our person, so we should not pass on this dirt of foreign
cloth to others. Had we not resolved to eschew the use of such cloth
altogether,  we  ourselves would have continued to wear it till we
had exhausted our stock. Having decided to give up its use, let us do
so in fact. Giving it to someone else to use is as good as using it
oneself. In giving it to others, we wish to earn the merit which
accrues from a good deed. It seems to me that we cannot claim to have
earned any such merit. We would throw away rotten grain; so also
should we throw away foreign cloth. Hindus, Muslims, Parsis should
all of them regard foreign cloth as unholy; if we do so, we would
certainly not use it. To create this feeling, I think it is necessary
that we discard the foreign cloth in our possession and throw it into
the fire. The sentiment which will be generated by our doing this is
of great value in my eyes. It is necessary, I think, to arouse so
strong a feeling against foreign cloth that no one would dare try to
deceive us in this matter. I shall, for this reason, regard ourselves
purified if, on August 1, we burn all our garments of foreign cloth.</p>

It is essential that we cultivate aversion to foreign cloth. Some
people ask me if this would not lead to hatred of foreigners. In this
movement, we should learn to condemn evil but, at the same time, love
the evil-doer. Man is not as evil as his deeds. We are all full of
failings; how then can we look down with contempt upon one another?
All religions teach us to serve the wicked. The test whether a man is
truly religious lies in his being free from the extremes of
passionate attachments and hatred. He alone has known God who, having
cause for anger, keeps it under control. It is the duty of every
human being to know God. Keeping one’s temper under control is not
the dharma of only the sannyasi; the latter, in fact is required to
keep many other difficult vows as well. We should, therefore, burn
cloth but bear no ill will to those who produce it. Let Manchester
and Japan go on doing so. If we do not purchase it, what can they do?
If we do not wish to drink liquor, what can the owner of the
liquor-booth do? If we think aright, we shall discover that the key
to swaraj is in our pocket. Let us</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
burn up the love of drinking which has possessed us and burn up our
love of fine silken cloth. Let us cast out the craving we feel for
numberless tasty dishes. If we have not learnt to look upon all women
as our sisters, let us bandage our eyes. The authors of the Shastras
have so graphically described the harmful effects of all the things
against which they wish to create dislike, that anyone who reflects
upon these will indeed develop it. Is it right, however, to create
dislike of people who produce these things? Should we burn the man
who makes liquor, or the foreigner who weaves silk or the man who
makes confectionery, and should we burn beautiful women? Should we
not, rather, burn up our cravings and the things which excite them?
Which of the two will find it possible to win swaraj—the one who
gives up liquor or the one who burns the man who produced it?</p>

Those who still prefer to send cloth abroad rather than burn it will
also be doing a commendable thing. Our Muslim brethren have been
sending cloth to Smyrna and our purpose will be served even if we
hand over our stock to be sent along with that. If only we give up
the use of foreign cloth our main purpose will have been served. If
people differ about the right use of discarded cloth, everyone may
follow his own inclination in the matter.</p>

changed. Who is to blame for that? I have spoken about boycott of
foreign cloth at each and every meeting since September. Those who
pursue unworthy occupations, those who are addicts, those whose
conduct is immoral, those who treat the untouchables with contempt
all of them have had notice as early as the movement for non-co-

Which non-co-operator wil not be delighted to read of the incident
that took place in Varad and a report of which was sent to newspapers
by Shri Kunvarji Vithalbhai? Professor Makanji deserves to be
congra-tulated on the patience and forbearance he displayed. When all
of us, in like manner, have learnt to submit to blows without getting
provoked, it will not be long before we win swaraj. The people of
Varad could have easily punished the person who, in his folly,
inflicted such indignities on Professor Makanji; but they restrained
themselves and thereby gave proof of their true courage. A word of
comment is necessa-ry about the professor’s companions having
abandoned him and run away for fear of being beaten up. Whatever the
danger to us, we should not run away and leave a companion alone,
but, on the contrary, protect him even at risk to our own lives. In
protecting someone, what is required is not the strength to strike
but the strength to lay down one’s life. Not running away from
battle has been described as the quality of the brave, of the
Kshatriya. Each of the four castes must, in some measure, have the
qualities of the others. It is sheer ignorance to believe that
Brahmins and <i>Vanias </i>do not need courage or cannot possibly
have it. Every one of us must have the strength to protect himself or
others by striking back, one exposes oneself to the danger of being
killed, and the degree of risk involved is the measure of one’s
courage. In making this criticism, I do not wish to blame the
professor’s companions. These are new experiences for us. So long
as we have not acquired sufficient courage to face danger, we are
bound to make such mistakes. We shall not be inviting any danger upon
ourselves as long as we do not resort to force and thereby violate

Traitors or persons who looked only to their interests were
respon-sible for our being enslaved and we continue to be slaves
because we cannot give up our selfishness. At this time when the work
of swadeshi is making rapid progress, traitors have been more active.
I have received three complaints. Some persons in Bombay have been
selling caps made of decaying foreign baize, foreign thread  and
foreign satin, exploiting the swadeshi movement and my name for the
purpose. These caps are black. My advice to those who wear swadeshi
caps is that they use only white caps made of khadi. A coloured cap
does not have the dignity, cleanliness and comfort of a white one.
The latter can always be washed. Black caps are dirty and they smell.
Anyone who has any notion of cleanliness will certainly not use caps
which are constantly absorbing perspiration. A cap lined with leather
is, besides, not good for the brain. How can a Hindu be happy with a
cap in making which leather has been used? The British use such caps,
but only when going outdoors and, besides, they change them
frequently. We who use the same turban or cap for a number of years
and keep one on all the time should find a leather cap intolerable. A
khadi cap, being clean and light, is wholly harmless. Moreover, to
what better use could khadi of the coarsest variety be put than to
making caps? One who is eager to dress himself in khadi from head to
foot should begin with the head straight away. The khadi cap can be
used by all, the rich and the poor. Those who can afford will wash
the khadi cap regularly, tailors will make designs on it and add more
layers to it. By all means let such alterations be made, but the idea
that all should have the same kind of cap on their heads is well
worth</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
considering. The conclusion should be that only the khadi cap is to
be regarded as swadeshi. Such a cap needs no stamp. A swadeshi cap
should be one that could be identified even by children. Just as we
can become true swarajists only by freeing ourselves from deceit and
hypocrisy, so also should we keep away from these in the matter of
caps. To those who are trying to sell foreign caps by passing them
off as swadeshi, I would say that, even if they cannot carry on their
business in an honest way, they should not practise dishonesty in a
matter which concerns national welfare. There should be honour even
among thieves. They do not practise theft amongst themselves. Some do
not touch the poor. A great <i>yajna </i>is on in the country; can we
not rise above the unworthy desire to exploit this to serve our base
self- interest? I should tell the people without any hesitation that
those who cheat them in this manner deserve to have their shops 
totally boycotted.</p>

What applies to caps applies also to long cloth. I have received a
letter from as far away as Simla in which the correspondent tells me
that some people have been selling Japanese long cloth as swadeshi
after rubbing off the Japanese markings, washing it and stamping it
again with a Bombay marking, and that some textile mills are also
involved in this. I hope that this time the mill-owners at any rate
will not be a party to any treachery to the country. While this
sacred movement is on, the country expects help from them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
It is necessary that the customers, too, should be on their guard. If
people give up being fascinated by fine cloth, there will be less
chance of their being cheated. People, on their own, will also be
able to recognize swadeshi goods if they give up the use of variously
starched materials. The way to be rid of all these difficulties lies
in using unbleached khadi. If every town makes the khadi that it
needs, there would be no possibility of anyone cheating anyone else.</p>

No one else can help the swadeshi movement as much as the mill-owners
can. The mill-owners of Ahmedabad have brought glory to their name by
contributing to the Tilak Swaraj Fund. Shri Ambalal Sarabhai has
enhanced their reputation by declaring his intention not to raise the
prices, to open his own shop where goods will be sold to individual
customers at wholesale prices and by helping the swadeshi movement in
this way. We have not been able to get his full support because he
has some fears about non-co-operation. I hope that he will</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
be fully in the movement when the non-co-operator, by his self-
restraint, has assured everyone that there is no ground for any
fears. Meanwhile, the letter in which he conveys his decision not to
raise prices will undoubtedly be of great help to us. I hope that
following the example of Shri Ambalal, other mill-owners will help
the swadeshi movement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Actually, what the dealers tell me is that not only should the
mill-owners not raise the prices but that even the present prices are
ex- cessively high, higher than the prices of cloth from Japanese
mills. Mill-owners must discuss this matter and come to a firm
decision.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
They should also assess the needs of the country and accept fewer
orders from abroad. Yarn, too, is being exported in large quantities,
and this policy, perhaps, needs to be suitably revised. It may be,
however, that this matter requires further consideration. So long as
people abroad need our goods, we may feel that we should continue to
supply their needs wherever we have been doing so. Our position is
different from England’s. There is a kind of coercion in England’s
trade with us, which is probably absent from our trade with other
countries. This is a separate matter and a rather delicate one. Three
things are certain beyond doubt. The traffic in opium is totally
immoral. We have been a willing party to the immorality of which the
Government of India has been guilty in this matter. The sin of having
harmed China will always remain on our heads. Food-grains and cotton
should certainly not be exported until the needs of our country are
fully met. Instead, large quan-tities of food-grains were exported

Another matter, the last, on which we seek the mill-owners’co-

sell as swadeshi cloth made from foreign yarn and they should not
starch cloth excessively. I hope that the mill-owners will discuss
these matters and come to decisions which would be in the interest of
the country.</p>

the Parsis are my own and not shared by the  people,  the  fear 
expressed by this gentleman should be taken into account. It is
certainly true that the remarks made about the Parsis in some circles
are not without malice. The faults of a small community like the
Parsis are conspicuous and their virtues remain in the dark. It is,
therefore, always necessary for us to bear their virtues in mind. Our
affection for people will increase only if we constantly think of
their virtues. If we look upon the Parsis as our brothers and
sisters, we are sure to recog- nize their generosity, their patience,
their civility, their intelligence, their faith in God, their innate
simplicity, and shall not see in them a single fault which we do not
find in the rest of us. I cannot think of</p>

any harm that has been done to India by the presence of the Parsis
here. It is plain enough that India has been benefited by their
coming. The main charge against them is that they have merely
imitated the civilization of the West and are gradually giving up
Indian culture. On deeper reflection, we shall see that this also is
not true. I admit that Western civilization has had a very
undesirable effect on them but not, relatively, more than on the
Hindus and Muslims. However, because of their small number and
because of the fact that they are concentrated in Bombay, the changes
that they have adopted are more apparent, whereas Hindus and Muslims
who, for all practical pur-poses, have become Englishmen do not send
out prominently before us as such persons are scattered all over the
country. The truth of this state-ment will be fully realized by any
Indian going to England. I saw little difference between Parsis,
Muslims and Hindus there. All seemed perfectly Anglicized.</p>

Just as a change has come over Hindus and Muslims, similarly Parsis
also have begun to change. Parsi youths have recognized the ideal of
simplicity. Parsi girls have taken to wearing khadi. Those who do not
have the courage to wear khadi wear cloth made in Indian mills. I
believe that as soon as the current among the Parsis changes its
direction, things will change greatly in no time. The Parsi community
has given me the impression that it will not turn disloyal. Being a
small commu-nity, it may not seem to have come forward in the measure
that the Hindus and Muslims have done but my conviction that they are
at heart Indians and that they love India will never be shaken. I do
not know in what matter they have remained backward. Hindus and
Muslims there-fore, should have regard for Parsis and should not
always be watching their faults or pointing at them.</p>

Our Parsi brethren have no cause for fear at all. One who has harmed
no one should have no fear. The Prophet Zoroaster has taught us that
nobility will always be rewarded by nobility. If a small community
may have some cause for fear, it has also reason to be unafraid. The
Parsis, knowing that they have done no harm to India, should be
convinced that India, in turn, win do them no harm. Only that
community or person which wishes to serve itself or himself in
disregard of the country’s interests has cause for fear. An
innocent person, even if he is in a minority of one, has no cause for
fear. Finally, I would most certainly appeal, in all humility, to my

A gentleman has written to me, drawing my attention to pictures
depicting me as Krishna and has asked me to stop such impropriety. I
have not seen a single such picture, nor do I wish to see any. These
things seem to me to violate propriety. We describe Shri Krishna as
the Supreme <i>Atman </i>is its infinite perfection. We look upon him
as the incarnation of God, as the perfect yogi of the <i>Gita. </i>We
do not think of Lakshmi as a woman, like any other in this world. We
describe her as the perfection of God’s <i>maya, </i>as the <i>dhatri
</i>who sustains the world. To depict me in the likeness of Shri
Krishna and my wife in that of Lakshmi is to shame us both. If,
seeing these likenesses, we come to cherish notions about ourselves,
we shall be guilty of sin. I am fully aware of my imperfections. I am
but a humble creature aspiring after <i>moksha </i>and striving
towards perfection. My wife is just an ordinary woman who strives to
keep pace with her husband, suffering in innumerable ways as she does
so. Our domestic life, I believe, is a happy one, but I have no other
desire except to go to my final rest while doing my duty on the path
of service. I am not at all enamoured of the adoration of the world
and my work has no such aim. Its only aim is my welfare. The self in
me assures me that I do everything in the belief that it is my dharma
to act as I do and, when any action is undertaken as being required
by one’s dharma, there can be no expectation of the world’s
adoration by way of reward. I feel extreme aversion to giving a
single moment for receiving adoration. It does not, therefore, please
me even to see my pictures being sold. To see myself, then, being
depicted in the likeness of any perfect man or my wife in that of a
perfect woman cannot but be intolerable to me. Those who have been
selling such pictures will put me under their obligation if they
destroy them. People who wish to honour me can do so only by loyally
acting upon the principles which I have placed before the public.
Those who pay me lip service or who collect my pictures while
ignoring my principles insult me and people who represent me by holy
images are guilty of irreverence. A wise man of old has said that no
man should be called good befor he is dead. He alone can attain
<i>moksha </i>who, even in the face of death, does not cease thinking

This is quite true. When the voters are all non-co-operators, a
co-operator is not likely to be elected as a delegate. If the
Congress has voting members who are in favour of co-operation and if
their votes add up to a majority,or if they can collect sufficient
votes to elect a delegate who advocates co-operation, they may
certainly do so and the election would be perfectly legal.</p>

them as the answer to these is contained in the answer to the
foregoing question. This question itself shows the frightfulness of
untouchability as we understand it today. There is nothing but scorn
of untouchables in our everybody behaviour towards them. I think the
very notion that education would make them give up being sweepers is
wrong. The reason for it, however, lies in ourselves.We look down on 
the profession of a <i>Bhangi</i>, but, in fact, it is sacred work as
it is concerned with cleanli-ness. A mother is regarded with all the
greater feeling of sanctity because she removes the faeces of the
child. We respect a woman who nurses the sick and is engaged in
removing things which smell most offensively. Should we not worship
the person who always cleans our lavatories and thereby helps us to
remain  free  from disease? By treating such persons as low, we have
sunk low ourselves. Anyone pushing another into a well himself falls
into it along with the other. We have no right, thus, to look down on
the <i>Bhangis </i>and others like them as belonging to low castes.</p>

Even though Bhoja Bhagat was a <i>Mochi, </i>we sing his devotional

or get alarmed. We shall not be fit for swaraj so long as we seek to
force any work on people. We should learn to keep our lavatories
clean. They will be as clean as our reading-room when we feel ashamed
of keeping them dirty. The fifth in our lavatories, the foul odour
and the gases which are generated in consequence are a blot on our
culture and bespeak our ignorance of the laws of hygiene. The
condition of our lavatories is a proof of our unworthy attitude to
the <i>Antyajas </i>and the cause of many of the diseases from which
we suffer. The idea that contact with members of other communities
will make us lose our caste or defile us betrays our weakness.
Contact is unavoidable so long as we are in the world, and the test
of the reality of dharma for us lies in our remaining pure in spite
of it. The way of compassion requires that we educate the <i>Bhangis
</i>and other communities like them to be clean, that we work for
their advance- ment and treat them with respect. To do this, it is
not necessary to sit down to meals with any member of such
communities; what  is  required is a change of heart.</p>

from commenting. I was indeed pained by two of our elderly scholars
accepting Government posts. But how can one criticize their action?
There can be no rule against the aged becoming professors nor any
that all old men should be non-co-operators. Then, we cannot say that
men of learning can never be in favour of co-operation. If, thus, the
old and the learned have the right to support co-operation, on what
ground can we criticize their action? That men of age and learning
see nothing wrong in accepting Government posts will certainly give
something like a shock to non-co-operators and make them pause and
think. But, then, even among the non-co-operators there are some old</p>

and learned men and I believe, therefore, that we need not think too
much about the matter. I think both these learned men have accepted
Government posts after careful deliberation and not because they were
tempted by any thought of personal gain. Hence,“Student”  and
others who feel like him are not justified in blaming these two
elderly gentlemen. To me, the surprise expresssd by “Student”
seems to suggest lack of tolerance. Others, especially our elders,
should have the same freedom of thought and action which we claim for
ourselves.</p>

I read a postcard received by the editor of <i>Prajamitra. </i>It is
written from Ahmedabad. It is signed, but has no address on it. The
signatory is a Muslim gentleman. Its language will hardly bear being
reproduced. It abuses the editor for criticizing my views. I hope
that the writer of this postcard, whoever he is and whatever his
community, will read this note. The writer, professing to be a
friend, has acted like an enemy. We shall not be able to advance the
cause of the Khilafat or swaraj by threatening or abusing anyone in
this manner. If we wish to advance them, we should learn civility and
humility. If the editor of <i>Prajamitra </i>disa-grees with some
one, how can he in any way be criticized for that? News-papers would
have no value if their editors did not have the right to express
their views freely. We want the removal of all restrictions im-posed
by the Government  on newspapers; should we, then, tolerate peo-ple
imposing restrictions by means of threats? We may try to change
people’s views and their attitudes by love, by persuasion and by
example. Threats will not succeed. Everyone, therefore, and specially
 a  non-co-ope-rator, should improve his language, purify his
thoughts and make them gentler. How can anyone whose tongue is
sanctified by uttering God’s name, in whose heart dwells God, have
unworthy words on that tongue and unworthy thoughts in that heart
even for a moment? Any person who joins the army of non-co-operators
with a foul tongue and an evil mind or heart, though he may claim to
be a friend, acts like an enemy.</p>

Gandhi said it was not the first time he had come to Madanpura, for
two years ago he had been there to see their work. But this meeting
was for a different purpose altogether. When he had come there last
there was no fear about the Khilafat question and they were sure of
getting justice at the hands of their rulers, because the Prime
Minister of Great Britain had promised to do the right thing by them.
But the British Government had done a great deal of harm to the
Mohammedans, and until their grievances were righted, their minds
could not be at rest. On account of the doings of the Government in
Punjab, the minds of the people were also very much disturbed. As
long as a single sepoy could not be stopped by the Indians from being
sent to foreign countries to fight for the British, so long could
they not be said to have real power in their hands. They had found a
powerful weapon now, and that was non-co-operation, and the Congress
had laid down in definite terms what they should do in that regard.
But the reponse of the people had not been great, for they had not
given up their titles, and they had not boycotted the schools or the
law-courts. Therefore, he said that the people had not done their
duty. But, in spite of this, the prestige of the Government had gone,
for people now did not set much store by Government titles; people
had been attending the law-courts not because these were good or they
were sure of getting justice there, but because they were a sign of
their degradation and their fall.</font></font></p>

them to give up the use of foreign yarn, and use only swadeshi and

a mass meeting in the Camp, Mahatma Gandhi said not an inch of cloth
must be imported from foreign lands. In days gone by, India used to
manufacture more than sufficient quantity of cloth. The Indian cotton
industry was ruined by the servants of the East India Company. The
imported cloth cost them Rs. 60,00,00,000. They must be prepared to
wear khadi and spin cotton. They must en-courage the weavers to take
up swadeshi yarn for weaving into cloth. Swadeshi was a religion.
Swaraj was an impossibility without rigorous obedience to this
religion.</font></font></p>

People are asking me whether one crore members have been placed on
the Congress register. I have not the accurate figures before me, but
I do know that we have nearly reached the figure, if we can be
satisfied with the mere mechanical registration. Let us however,
understand the implication. It is that we have one crore men and
women who believe in and wish to work for the Congress creed. Boycott
of foreign cloth is the acid test. If we have one crore of men and
women of one mind in India, we must have an ocular proof of it in our
streets and villages. Do we see as we walk about that one out of
every thirty men and women is dressed in khadi or at least swadeshi?
Do the majority of those who make our audiences present the
appearance of swadeshi? The answer must be a reluctant but an
emphatic no. I would, therefore, advise all Congress organizations to
mind nothing but swadeshi till we have brought about a complete
boycott of foreign cloth. In order to be able to do this, it is high
time that every Congress worker dressed himself or herself in coarse
khadi. That <i>must </i>be the swaraj soldier’s uniform. I am
looking forward to the All-India Congress Committee meeting, hoping
that the members will bear on their persons the mark of soldiership.
If we are to attain complete boycott, say, by the 31st August, the
Congress organizations must become carding, spinning and weaving
institutes. Congress workers must become experts in carding, spinning
and weaving. Let them not write helplessly to the Ashram at Sabarmati
for information and guidance. Thank God, every province has now some
knowledge of these processes. The workers in each province must 
befriend  carders (<i>pinjaras</i>), spinners and weavers, learn the
trade from them, so that they may be able to protect it and not
compete with them. Let them also befriend carpenters and blacksmiths
for charkhas and spindles. Let them stock sufficient khadi and sell
it at cost price, the cost to include the expense of running the
store. In other words, every Congress office must, for the time
being, be an arsenal for the storage and manufacture of peaceful
ammunition. Is this a ludicrous or impossible demand? Was not every
available hand in England, France</p>

and Germany working for furthering the objects of the War? If we
beli-eve that swaraj is unattainable without swadeshi, does it not
follow that we must ceaselessly and intelligently devote our
attention our boycott, manufacture and distribution to the almost
entire exclusion of every other activity? All meetings, and all
declamation at our meetings when they are held, must be stopped. We
must consider our weaknesses and shortcomings rather than contemplate
the rulers. Con- templation of the latter can only breed hatred,
weakness and help- lessness. That of the for-mer and consequent
action will give us courage, strength and hope. If, therefore, we
hold meetings, they must be simply business meetings to demonstrate
the necessity of boycott and manufacture, and to show the way
thereto.</p>

A correspondent draws my attention to the fact that there is now on

must intrude upon even sacred soil? Our mills have enough work for
their machines without trying to take the bread out of the mouths of
the poor workers in their cottages. But let the consumer beware.
Hand-spun is unmistakable, especially when it is unbleached and
unwashed. Let him beware of cloth that looks like mill-made and is
yet claimed to be hand-spun and hand-woven. The fact is that hand-
spun has and ought to have an individuality about it. It must have a
finish peculiar to it, and it should never have the dead glossiness
of mill-made cloth. Hand-spun khadi has a roughness that is soothing.
Hand-made khadi is absorbent, light, pleasant to the touch, and it
cannot be produced at 4 annas a yard without sweating both the weaver
and the spinners, unless it is manufactured entirely from waste when
it is flimsy and wears away after a few washes. And it is best always
to buy from stores one knows. The Congress Committees in Bombay and
Ahmedabad have taken to certifying stores where pure khadi can be
purchased at reasonable prices. Only that is khadi whose warp and
woof are hand-spun and which is hand-woven.</p>

The <i>kirpan</i>—the Sikh scimitar—is for the Sikh,“what,”
says the Secretary of the Sikh Young Men’s Association, “the
sacred thread is to the Brahmin.” And now the Punjab Government is
trying to divest the Sikhs of their ‘sacred thread’ by
restricting its length and breadth. Much as I abhor the possession or
the use of arms, I cannot reconcile myself to forcible prohibition.
As I said three years ago, this forcible disarmament of a people will
be regarded by history as one of the blackest sins committed by the
British Government against India. If people want to possess arms,
they ought to have them without ado. But, in the case of the Sikhs,
who have held <i>kirpans </i>without let or hindrance all these
years, the crime is worse. The Secretary has no difficulty in proving
that this war against the <i>kirpan </i>has synchronized with
repressive measures adopted against this brave community. The reason
too is obvious. The Sikhs have attained political consciousness. They
are not content merely to kill at the bidding of their officers. They
want to weigh the pros and cons of a cause in which they are called
upon to fight. Above all, they want to know where they ‘come in’.
They want to become equal partners. This is intolerable, and they
must be put down. The bravest among them have, as the Government
imagine, been silenced. I can only hope that, rather than surrender
their sacred weapon, the Sikhs will court imprisonment. We cannot</p>

If proof were wanted that the movement of non-co-operation is neither
anti-British nor anti-Christian, we have the instance of Mr. Stokes,
a nationalized British subject and staunch Christian, devoting his
all to the eradication of the evil of <i>begar</i>. Mr. Stokes is a
convinced non-co-operator and Congressman. I think I am right in
saying that he has come to it by slow degrees. No Indian is giving
such battle to the Government as Mr. Stokes. He has veritably become
the guide, philosopher and friend of the hill-men. The reader should
know that <i>begar </i>is going on under the shadow of Simla, under
the Viceroy’s nose as it were. And yet Lord Reading is powerless to
remedy the mischief. I have no doubt that he is willing enough. But
he cannot carry the district officers and others with him. And some
of the officials are so unscrupulous that if they cannot have their
way in the territories directly administered, they do so through the
native States. Now, on the hills near Simla there are small native
States in which the British officer is all-powerful, more so in his 
own jurisdiction than the Viceroy. He can make the states do as he
wills, and yet profess to be unconnected with their doings. There is
one such state under the Court of Wards. And it is here that, through
the influence of the Deputy Commissioner of Simla, repression is
going</p>

on in order to suppress the <i>begar </i>movement. The chosen way,
which, as a Parsi friend corrected me, dates not from British days
but from Adam’s, is to lop off tall poppies. The axe must be laid
at the root. And so the most efficient and cultured of the poor
hillmen named Kapur Singh has been under lock and key. Here is a

Naturally, the hillmen feel sore about this persecution of their
trusted leader. I hope that under Mr. Stokes’ inspiration, they
will re- solutely refuse to do any <i>begar </i>at all even for full
value until their leader is discharged. They must not weaken, but
must invite upon their devoted heads the wrath of the authorities and
face imprisonment even as he did.</p>

Why this persistence in exacting <i>begar</i>? For the authority, the
influence and the comfort of the officials and officers depend upon
the continuance of <i>begar</i>. Without it, they cannot sport and
kill wild beasts in the forests of the Himalayas. The Duke could not
have been taken for shikar to the mountain fastnesses, if <i>begar
</i>had gone out of use. For the doubtful pleasure of shooting 
tigers  and  innocent ‘game’, a way had to be cut by impressing
the labours of thousands of unwilling villagers. If the beasts had
intelligent speech at their command, they would state a case against
man that ‘would stagger humanity’. I can understand the shooting
of wild beasts which come to annoy us. But I have found no cogent
reasons advanced for wasting treasures upon organizing parties for
satisfying man’s  thirst  for  blood. And yet, if there was no
<i>begar</i>, there would be no ‘sport’ for the officers or the
globetrotters. I need not have the practice of Indian princes and
precedents from the <i>Mahabharata </i>flung in my face. I decline to
be slave to precedents or practice I cannot understand or defend on a
moral basis.</p>

‘disease as bad as untouchability’. Shrimati Saraladevi has
grossly ex- aggerated the evil. Nor can the charge levelled against
the non-co- operators of mere gratification of lust be sustained. A
cause can only lose by exaggeration. At the same time, I have no
difficulty about subscribing to the proposition that, in order to fit
ourselves for true swa-raj, men must cultivate much greater respect
than they have for woman and her purity. Mr. Andrews has struck a
much truer note than this lady, when he tells us in burning language
that we dare not gloat over the shame of our fallen sisters. That any
non-co-operator could have been found willing to relate with gusto
that there were some of these erring sisters who reserved themselves
for non-co- operators is a degrading thou-ght There can be no
distinction between co-operators and non-co-operators in this matter
of vital importance for our moral well-being. All of us men must hang
our heads in shame, so long as there is a single woman whom we
dedicate to our lust. I will far rather see the race of man extinct
than that we should become less than beasts by making the noblest of
God’s creation the object of our lust. But this is not a problem
merely for India. It is a world problem. And if I preach against the
modern artificial life of sensual enjoyment, and ask men and women to
go back to the simple life epitomized in the charkha, I do so because
I know that without an intelligent return to simplicity, there is no
escape from our descent to a state lower than brutality. I
passionately desire the utmost freedom for our women. I detest
child-marriages. I shudder to see a child widow, and shiver with rage
when a husband just widowed with brutal indifference contracts
another marriage. I deplore the criminal indifference of parents who
keep their daughters utterly ignorant and illiterate and bring them
up only for the purpose of marrying them</p>

off to some young men of means. Notwithstanding all this grief and
rage, I realize the difficulty of the problem. Women must have votes
and an equal legal status. But the problem does not end there. It
only commences at the point where women begin to affect the political
deliberations of the nation.</p>

To illustrate what I mean, let me relate the enchanting description a
valued Mussulman friend gave me of a talk he had with  a noted
feminist in London. He was attending a meeting of feminists. A lady
friend was surprised to find a Mussulman at such a meeting! She
inquired how he found himself there. The friend said he had two major
and two minor reasons for so doing. His father died when he was an
infant. He owed all he was in life to his mother. Then lie was
married to a woman who was a real partner in life. And he had no sons
but four daughters—all minors—in whom as a father he was deeply
interested. Was it any wonder that he was a feminist? He went on,
Mussulmans were accused of indifference to women. There never was a
grosser libel uttered. The law of Islam gave equal rights to women.
He thought that man for his lust had degraded  woman. Instead of
adoring the soul within her, he had set about adoring her body, and
he had succeeded so well in his design, that woman today did not know
that she had begun to hug her bodily adornment which was almost a
sign of her slavery. He added with his voice almost choked, if it was
not so, how could it be that the fallen sisters delighted most in the
embellishment of the body? Had we (men) not crushed the very soul out
of them? No, he said regaining self-possession, he wanted not only
the mechanical freedom for women, he wanted also to break down the
shackles that bound her of her own will. And so he had intended to
bring up his daughters to an independent calling.</p>

I need not pursue the ennobling conversation any further. I want my
fair correspondent to ponder over the central idea of the Mussulman
friend’s discourse and tackle the problem. Woman must cease to
consider herself the object of man’s lust. The remedy is more in
her hands than man’s. She must refuse to adorn herself for men
including her husband, if she will be an equal partner with man. I
cannot imagine Sita ever wasting a single moment on pleasing Rama by
physical charms.</p>

thoughtful essay, entitled ‘Law and Gospel’.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

offer no excuse for reproducing it in full for the benefit of the
many readers of <i>Young India </i>who could not have seen it. The
able writer of the essay calls the world-revolt an essentially
religious movement. The reader must judge whether Indian
non-co-operation, based as it deliberately is on a frank acceptance
of non-violence (however much we may fail in its application), is not
the most religious of all the movements going on in different parts
of the world for freeing mankind from the yoke of a system falsely
called civilization.</p>

Non-co-operation has two aspects—discarding old and creating new,
destruction and reconstruction. We cannot proceed without  either.
They are fully comprehended in the steps we have taken so far to rise
to the point where we stand today and, in my opinion, we can make no
further progress except by continuing in the same manner. Peaceful
non-co-operation seems impossible to me in any other way.</p>

It is my settled conviction that we cannot advance even one step
without adopting swadeshi. Through it alone can all our powers be
developed. In swadeshi alone are present both purposeful destruction
and purposeful creation. It alone provides exercise to all limbs of
the body which is the nation and tests their strength. To this day,
the people have not thrown themselves heart and soul into any work.
Success in the experiment of swadeshi is impossible except through
single-minded devotion to the task. A nation which has learnt to work
with such devotion holds swaraj in the palm of its hand; without
swadeshi, swaraj is as much of an impossibility as a flower in the
sky.</p>

For success in swadeshi, we shall have to discard the use of foreign
cloth altogether and shall have to produce more cloth in the country.
So far, we have been afraid to destroy. As we have now discovered the
 <i>ratnachintamani</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>of the spinning-wheel, we have got hold of the supreme
tool for creation. But we need to pay careful attention to the aspect
of dis-carding. The pace of creation can be increased only up to a
certain point, after which it will follow its own course. Destruction
can be carried out in an instant. In order  to destroy, it is
necessary to have a strong desire to do so. We shall be ready to
destroy when our ideas have changed.</p>

It has been said, on the basis of experience, that renunciation
cannot be kept up in the absence of aversion to objects of desire. We
should feel the same aversion or dislike towards foreign cloth as for
anything which is filthy. Till we feel such aversion, we shall again
and again feel drawn by Japanese saris and Manchester muslin, shall
demand such material, and dealers professing to offer these will 
deceive us by selling the original stuff instead. So, for the
present, we should refuse to touch even such articles as resemble
foreign material. We should be careful lest we get cheated. If we are
to feel such aversion against foreign cloth, we should also be clear
in our mind that foreign cloth is at the root of our slavery. All
else has come in its wake. The East India Company’s fort followed
foreign cloth and was built for the sake of such cloth.</p>

manya? In one way alone: by all of us resolving on that day to give
up the use of foreign cloth altogether. On that day all the people in
a town or village should get together at one place and throw away all
their stock of foreign cloth, never to have such cloth again. This is
the highest worship and, by this single act, we can ensure the
attainment of swaraj within this year. Hence from now on to the 1st
of August we should have, whether eating, drinking, sitting or
standing, only this thought in our mind : how we may give up the use
of foreign cloth and persuade others to do likewise. As we worked
hard to collect the money, we should work harder still to get people
to re-nounce the use of foreign cloth. Every community and caste
should make its own arrangements.The different communities should
collect foreign cloth from among their members and hand over the
stock to the Congress. A receipt should also be obtained. Women will
find the thing hard. It was easy to contribute money, easy even to
give away jewellery, but it would be extremely difficult to discard
beautiful saris  of foreign make. Nevertheless, they should swallow
this bitter draught. This is the last such draught for the nation as
a whole. Afterwards only a handful of men and women will have to be
ready to court imprisonment. May God give this spirit of self-denial

Creation is the second aspect. Those who have started wearing khadi
should work to get more khadi produced. Any delay in this would be
sinful. We shall most certainly require a large quantity of khadi if
the people give up using foreign cloth altogether. We have been
destroying foreign cloth because we want to promote the use of khadi
and we want this because in that way we spread the use of the
spinning-wheel, giving people work and bringing some decency in their
simple life in huts. The average income of an Indian is twenty- six
rupees a year, and this is the easiest way to double the figure.
Where millions are concerned, there can be no other way. Every home
in Gujarat, therefore, should start working on the spinning-wheel and
every village should produce khadi made out of hand-spun yarn. For
the present, this should be the main plank in the programme of the
All-India Congress Committee. We shall give proof of our capacity for
work by our success in persuading people to discard and to create.</p>

the prestige of khadi and increase the income of the weavers, we
shall have to see that khadi comes to be adopted as the dress of

revive the craftsmanship which once flourished in it unless we make

It would not be too much to expect of Gujarati merchants that they
will not henceforth import foreign cloth. Influential leaders of the
Congress should visit each town where foreign cloth is sold and
request the merchant concerned to give up business in such cloth.
Thus, the most important task to which members of the Congress should
address themselves is to see that every section of the public turns
towards swadeshi.</p>

I am not connected with banking business and banking institutions and
I know very little of the management thereof; I was induced to come
here by friends and I am attracted here by their love. I sometimes
come here to beg for money for the sake of our motherland. I have
also to approach you for persuading you to aban- don foreign cloth
and to encourage swadeshi in which lies the key to swaraj. We should
have the ability to carry on a big bank, to manage efficiently crores
of rupees, in the course of our national activities. Though we have
not many banks amongst us, it does not follow that we are not capable
of efficiently managing crores and tens of crores of rupees. Banking
business is carried on in our country for the last many hundreds of
years. Our Marwaris are born bankers and they would have managed not
only crores but hundreds of crores of rupees had they been born in
any other land but India. But since they are born in this
poverty-stricken land, their capacity is but poorly valued. A writer
has said that most of the recent wars are due to economic causes. At
the same time it can be said that the rich people are the means of
doing immense good to suffering humanity. I hope also that the bank
will be carried on on high moral principles and I wish it every
prosperity. Now I declare the premises open.</p>

Remember the holy name of “Lokamanya’ on the 1st August by
discarding foreign cloth and wearing khaddar. Boycott is an indis-

Those who will not wear khadi, at least our mill-made cloth, need not
attend. To come dressed in foreign clothes is an insult to the memory
of the deceased Lokamanya. Give away the foreign cloth to volunteers
or send it to the stores opened in the Ashoka Building in Princess
Street<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>. To
make a bonfire of them is the best way; but,   if you wish, they will
be sent to Smyrna or some other country.</p>

had been telling them since 6th April that unless Hindus understood
that only by joining hands with the Mussulmans they could have the
Khilafat wrongs righted, and unless Muslims thought that only by
joining hands with Hindus they could succeed in achieving their
object, they would not be in a position to attain the goal of swaraj.

they would instan- tly oblige. I was emphatic in my refusal to do so,
and they went away angry, doubt- ing the sincerity of my love for my
motherland. And yet long before this popular ebullition of excitement
I myself had given a thousand rupees, when I had not five rupees to
call my own, to open a swadeshi store and courted banter and
bankruptcy. The reason of my refusing to advise those students to
leave their schools was because the anarchy of a mere emptiness never
tempts me, even when it is resorted to as a temporary measure. I am
frightened of an abstraction which is ready to ignore living reality.

superstructure. I believe in the true meeting of the East and the
West. Love is the ultimate truth of soul. We should do all we can not

The idea of non-co-operation unnecessarily hurts that truth. It is
not our hearth fire, but the fire that burns out our hearth and home.</font></font></p>
