I have purposely omitted names and places as they are not germane to
my theme. The point is quite clear. Whether the Reverend gentleman
referred to did not overstep the limit of patriotism is not the point
to be examined. The lesson Sjt. Rangam Chetty wishes to draw from the
incident is quite legitimate. We, in our country, are in honour bound
to prefer handspun khaddar to foreign cloth, no matter how
inconvenient it may be to us. It is flimsy philosophy that teaches us
to go to the cheapest market irrespective of what happens
therethrough to our next-door neighbours. Free donations of fine
wheat from Australia or America will be poison to us, if that meant a
workless India with her soil growing weeds instead of golden grain.
Similarly a free gift of cloth from Manchester would be too costly a
bargain for India to accept. I repeat, therefore, that khaddar is
cheap at any price so long as it serves to utilize the idle hours of

  by   the Congress think that it is something new sprung by me upon
a Cong- ress that was eager for a vigorous, forward policy. In the
first place I claim no originality for my resolution, for, it closely
follows the pres- idential address. In the second, it is identical
with the now much lauded programme of 1920-21,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>with
certain desirable addi-tions. In 1921, as now, we had prohibition
with picketing, we had kha-ddar and boycott of foreign cloth with the
burning demonstrati-ons and we had untouchability campaign and
Hindu-Muslim unity. The present pro- gramme adds the amelioration of
the status ofwomen and removal of kindred social abuses. It also adds
village reconstru-ction and organization of city labour—surely,
items that must find place in any constructive programme for the
attainment of swaraj.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
Is there not excitement enough in the programme, if Congres- smen are
serious about it? Picketing of liquor shops, foreign cloth shops and
collection and burning of foreign  cloth  are  exciting enough for
any worker and are enough to evoke all the resource fuln- ess that
the best workers may be capable of.</p>

What, indeed, we have not in my resolution of the programme of
1920-21 is the boycott of legislatures, law-courts and educational
institutions and titles. Nothing would please me better than to find
these institutions that sustain the Government abandoned  by  the
nation or at least Congressmen. I know that then we should have
swaraj and, what is perhaps more, we should have less corruption in
the Congress than we now have. But that time is not yet. Congressmen
assist legislatures, law-courts and schools as much as any other, and
perhaps during this year when the Congress works for the attainment
of a constitution in accordance with the Nehru Report it must
function through the legislatures. In any event one year is not too
much even for the most impatient independencewallah to organize for
the quadruple boycott assuming, of course, that the Nehru Report
status is not attained during the twelve months. And if we are
serious about</p>

And is the present programme quite so tame as it is made to appear?
Was the picketing of liquor traps a tame affair? Let  Dr. Kanuga and
his band of volunteers who were assaulted by angry  liquor dealers
and their myrmidons answer. Let the hundreds of the prisoners in
Assam answer who were mercilessly clapped into the Assam jails
because they had the audacity to picket opium dens. Was the burning
of foreign cloth a tame affair? Let Sarojini Devi who gave her very
beautiful costly foreign scarf and many girls who gave up their rich
foreign silks and other fineries they had learnt to treasure answer.
There is nothing to prevent Congressmen now from picketing liquor
traps or opium dens or from collecting and burning foreign cloth.
Apart from the great social and economic value of these two very
powerful items they have a political value of the very first order.
If we achieve boycott of foreign cloth we remove from Britain’s
path the greatest incentive to greed, and if we stop the liquor and
drug revenue, we force the rulers to reduce the ever-growing military
exp- enditure. These two things so easy to accomp-lish, so well
suited to employ the energy of a vast mass of people, I hold, will go
a long way towards the fulfilment of the national purpose, if we can
but accomplish them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I claim that the programme is so catholic as to satisfy all tastes
and to occupy the whole nation. If we are many workers, we can take
up all the items at once, if we are few, we may take up one item at a
time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
There is, I admit, one important condition necessary to make the
programme palatable, and that is, a living belief in non-violence for
the establishment of swaraj or Dominion Status or Independence,
whichever the name we may give to our object. It is not difficult to
think out a programme that would immediately precipitate violence.
That however is beyond my ken or capacity.</p>

It is reported that the Government propose to take legal pro-
ceedings against those who strive for complete independence carrying
severance of British connection with it. It has further been
suggested that organizations working for complete independence should
be suppressed. I am not aware of any law enabling the Government to
punish the active advocacy of independence. I wish the Gov-ernment
would take steps against the promoters of independence. It will clear
the political atmosphere and show what the Government mean by
Dominion Status. If it does not carry with it the power to sever con-
nection with the British, it is a form of bondage be it so mild. An
India, impatient of servitude and waiting to come to her own, will
never be content with any form of bondage. No national assembly can
possibly be permitted to be the custodian of national honour, if it
does not strive for the best that the nation is entitled to. Any move
on the part of the Government, therefore against the propaganda of
indepen- dence <i>cum </i>severance of British connection will
precipitate the issue and undoubtedly give added strength to the
severance movement. As I have already remarked, we must have the
power to sever the con- nection even though we may never exercise
that power. Whether we should and would exercise that power or not
will depend wholly upon how British rulers behave towards us during
these critical times. The school of severance must have the fullest
liberty to vow and carry on its propaganda unhampered by any
Governmental act, direct or indirect, open or secret. The only
honourable way to prevent the school from growing is to make the
connection worthwhile for us to retain. That can only be whenthe
imperialistic spirit, the spirit of exploitation is killed and
partnership on absolutely equal  terms  offered in the place of
present bondage.</p>

education had only just begun. Acharya Ramadeva’s was an impa-

devised to manufacture clerks, not statesmen, to make students ‘black
Englishmen’ according to Macaulay, but not better Indians. He had
no difficulty in showing that the foreign method, grafted by foreig-
ners on the Indian, had resulted in terrible increase of illiteracy.</p>

The Registrar’s report which was a businesslike document sho- wed
that the Vidyapith was still doing pruning work and strengthening its
foundation. Nevertheless it was able to show a literary output of no
mean order in the shape of text books and research work done by the
Puratatva Mandir with whose activity were identified scholars  like
Muni Jinvijayaji and Prof. Dharmananda Kosambi and Pandit Sukh-
lalji. The Vidyapith hopes inside of three months to furnish the
Guja- ratis with an authorized spelling dictionary, a want that is
being increa- singly felt. Great stress is being laid upon manual
training which is superstitiously believed to interfere with the
development of the intellect.</p>

The occasion was utilized by the graduates to present Acharya
Kripalani with the khadi purse which the students had intended to
collect and present to their popular Principal when he retired last
year. The purse contained over Rs. 6,000. Acharya Kripalani in
thanking the students for their purse reiterated his promise to visit
Gujarat from time to time and by citing his experience of the solid
work being done by the old students among untouchables and Raniparaj
showed that the Vidyapith had more than justified its existence.
Whilst he was proud of all the menial labour that these workers were
doing with zest, he warned them against neglecting brainwork after
leaving college. He added that the marvellous work done by the Sardar
of Bardoli could not have been done, if he had not combined great
brain capacity with rare courage and equally rare powers of
endurance.</p>

Sjt. Jairamdas and other Sind friends pressed me whilst I was in
Calcutta to go to Sind for the Lalaji Memorial collection. I could
not resist the temptation. Though being pledged to tour for khadi I
could not go to many places for this collection, I would not refuse
the spor- ting offer from Sind. The collections for the Lalaji
Memorial are creeping in, not pouring as they should have. It would
be a shame if the five lacs are not forthcoming within a reasonable
time. The donors have no excuse now for delaying, as they know
exactly the purpose to which the collections are to be devoted. I am
hoping therefore that the response from Sind will be generous enough
to serve as guide to the other provinces.</p>

Nor must Sind forget khadi. My visit to Sind has, I know, been long
overdue. Khadi lovers have been inviting me ever since my release
from Yeravda to visit Sind for khadi propaganda and collecti- ons.
Let them now prepare their offering for  <i>Daridra narayana</i>. And
I expect the silk-bedecked Sindhi ladies to think of their poor
sisters as also to render me an account of their connection with the
evil custom of <i>deti-leti</i>. Many of them promised to exert
themselves to do away with it root and branch. I hope that they will
prove as good as their word.</p>

	as much as he can. Your letter under reply does not quite give me
	that impre- ssion. Kripalani himself, I understand, has written to
	you already, because on the strength of Jamnalalji’s letter, I had

I have your letter. Why do you write to me in English? Surely you
know Hindi well. You know Gujarati also. But if you could not write
in Gujarati or in Hindi, you might have written even in Sindhi and I
would have got someone to decipher it for me. After all Sindhi is
written in the Persian script. However, you will have to render an
account of these things when I come to Karachi.</p>

Correspondents from Travancore continue to write to me about the use
by the so-called untouchables of roads surrounding the Suchindram
temple. I was led to expect when I was in Travancore<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

short time. Consi- derable time has now elapsed and nothing
apparently has been done. May I know whether there is any likelihood

near future?</p>

Tulsidas has put this vow in Ramachandra’s mouth. Indian tradition
abounds in examples where one’s pledge is held as dear as one’s
life. I hope the students of Gujarat College will add another example
by keeping their pledge. The conditions on which the Principal would
permit them to study do not enhance his prestige nor do they ennoble
the students if they agree to them. In this there is an attempt to
get a confession from the students as if they had committed an error
instead of the Principal admitting his own. The students deserve
congratulations on not agreeing to such conditions. It was their
dharma not to agree to conditions. They will be considered truly
educated if they keep their pledge till the end. And they will be
regarded as having made a great contribution towards taking the
country forward. One need not doubt that such action by the students
will have far-reaching consequences. The students’ victory does not
consist in their returning to the college somehow, but in observing
their pledge till their last breath. If they thus learn the first
lesson of honouring their pledge, they will in future be able to
serve the country well, because they will have greater
self-confidence. Moreover, to one who has cultivated self-confidence,
everything else in this world becomes easy.</p>

With reference to your letter No. 1519, dated 18h January, you may
have 30th September as the date up to which candidates for election
should have paid up their subscriptions. And the candidate for
election being a member only of one month’s duration, in my
opinion, does not matter for the simple reason that one would expect
the voters to make the best selection out of candidates nominated.</p>

enclosing Satisbabu’s letter, I like Satisbabu’s suggestion.
There are, however, practical difficulties in the way of holding an
exhibition during the Congress Week. Unless the Congress wants such
an exhibi- tion, we may not set up an exhibition in the teeth of
Congress opposi-- tion. What, however, we can do is to hold an
independent all-India exhibitionevery year. And if we can get
sufficient workers for the purpose, it can become a striking
demonstration. It can draw large crowds and it can be a means of
selling off all the surplus stock of khadi without any difficulty. It
can become a dignified andeduca-tive effort. Let Satisbabu consider
this suggestion. I may however state that, so far as this year’s
Congress is concerned, I am already in touch with the exhibition.

I have your letter. The line at the end of your letter is alarming. 
I wish you, Hemprabhadevi and Tarini would heed Nature’s warning.
It is false economy to wear yourselves out there. Do go  out of
Sodepur and give yourselves complete rest. Come here if you can be
happy and if the climate will agree or go to Chandranagore. It is a
great pity that you cannot exchange with Abhoy Ashram. Why not simply
send Tarini there? of course, it is to be done naturally and
spontaneously.</p>

Herewith two letters with copies of my reply. I wish you would not be
guided by Rajaji in the matter of this tour, but take the respo-
nsibility upon your own shoulders and decide. If I am not taken at
express speed, I should be able to go through the programme without
the slightest difficulty as I imagine. But I do not know whether I
can spare the time. You must therefore definitely say whether you
want me and if so, for how long and when. Together with all other
circum- stances, I shall then be able to decide. I warn you against
putting off the Karnatak tour indefinitely.</p>

If we have graduates’ associations, civil service associations and
the like, why not Khadi Service Association or Khadi Sevak Sangha?
This service, if it is to succeed, should certainly be the most
numerous in the world if not even the most important. It is true that
it will never bring the same remuneration as the other services which
are only so-called but which are based more or less, perhaps more
rather than less, upon exploitation. Khadi Service is a purely
philanthropic  agency and the servants are merely maintained on the
principle that a labourer is worthy of his hire. But in Khadi Service
there is a higher satisfaction than that of pecuniary reward. The
satisfaction lies in the knowledge that the servant ministers to the
needs ofthe neediest, the most helpless and the most numerous class
of men in the country.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
As this truth is being realized, khadi servants begin also to plan
ways and means of consolidating their trust. Hence at the usual
weekly meeting of the Khadi Service candidates who are undergoing
training at the Udyoga Mandir, late Satyagraha Ashram, the question
of  forming a Khadi Service Association was seriously discussed and
it was resolved to form such an association. To that end I invite all
those who have received training at any of the institutions
recognized by the All-India Spinners’ Association to send to the
Secretary, Udyoga Mandir, the following particulars: name in full,
present address, age, whether married or single, children if any,
where trained for Khadi Service, previous qualifications, present
occupation, wages and such other information as may be useful for the
proposed Association. An early opportunity will be taken to form a
provisional body and frame a provisional constitution. The object of
this body should be:</p>

These are only suggestions thrown out at random. The first step will
be to publish a directory of names and addresses of such servants.
The number of persons trained at the Ashram to date already comes up
to <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">44 </font></sup>5. There
is, no doubt, a large number trained by the other khadi
organizations. It will not be therefore an unpretentious direc- tory
by any means. In sending names care, I hope, will be taken to send
only those who are or were doing khadi work and have received
adequate training and who have sought this service as volunteers,
i.e., from the strictly philanthropic motive. The desire of the
promoters of the idea is to make the proposed association an
efficient organization of true servants. Writers will send their
suggestions as to the condition of membership, objects, etc.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.22cm; line-height: 102%">
The strike of nearly seven hundred students of the Gujarat College
which has now gone on for over 20 days is no longer a matter merely
of local importance. A labour strike is bad enough, a students’
strike is worse whether it is justly declared or unjustly. It is
worse because of the consequences it entails in the end and because
of the status of the parties. Unlike labourers, students are educated
and can have no material interest to serve by means of strikes, and
unlike employers, heads of educational institutions have no interest
in con- flict with that of the students. Students moreover are
supposed to be embodiments of discipline. A strike of students
therefore produces far-reaching consequences and can only be
justified in extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But though occasions for students’ strikes in well-ordered schools
and colleges must be rare, it is not impossible to conceive such as
to warrant strikes on their part. Thus for instance if a principal
run- ning counter to public opinion refuses to recognize a day of
uni- versal rejoicing as a holiday which both parents and their
school or college-going children may desire, students will be
justified in declaring a strike for that day. Such occasions will be
more frequent in India as the students grow more self-conscious and
become more alive to a sense of their responsibility to the nation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
In the case of the Gujarat college I cannot help saying that so far
as I have been able to judge, the students have had ample reason</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
for the strike. It is quite wrong to say, as has been said in some
quarters, that the strike has been engineered by a few mischievous
students. It is impossible for a handful of mischief-makers to hold
together seven hundred boys for over a fortnight. As it is, there are
responsible citizens advising and guiding the students. Chief among
these is Sjt. Mavlankar, a pleader of experience and known for his
wisdom and moderation. He has been in touch with the Principal and is
firmly of opinion that the students are absolutely in the right.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The facts can be briefly told. The students absented themselves from
college with the rest of the boys all over India on the Simon boycott
day. The absence was no doubt unauthorized. The students were
technically in the wrong. They should have at least asked for formal
permission before they  absented  themselves,  But  boys are the same
all the world over. One might as well hope to restrain the winds as
hope to curb the roused enthusiasm of students. Theirs was at best a
youthful indiscretion. This was condoned by the Principal after a
great deal of negotiation, the boys being permitted optionally to
appear for their terminal examination on a fee of Rs. 3 each, it
being understood that the majority would appear and that those who
did not would not be in any way punished. The Principal, however, it
is  alleged, broke his pledge and put up notice making it compulsory
for the boys to appear for the terminal examination upon payment of
Rs. 3 each. This naturally incensed the boys. They felt: ‘if the
salt loseth its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?, They therefore
struck work. The rest is simple. The strike continues and friends and
critics alike certify to the great self-restraint and correct conduct
of the boys. In my opinion, students of a college are in duty bound
to resist such breach of honour by their Principal as is alleged
against the Principal of the Gujarat College. It is impossible to
tender to a teacher that unreserved respect to which he is entitled
by reason of his honourable calling when he is found to be guilty of
breach of honour.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
If the students are resolute there can be but one end to the strike,
viz., withdrawal of the offending notice and an absolute promise of
immunity from any punishment to the students. Indeed the  most proper
thing would be for the Government to appoint  another Principal for
the College.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
There is in the Government Colleges too much of espionage and
persecution of boys holding pronounced political views or taking any
part in political gatherings not liked by the Government. It is high</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
time that this unwarranted interference was stopped. In a country
groaning as India is under foreign rule, it is impossible to prevent
students from taking part in movements for national freedom. All that
can be done is to regulate their enthusiasm so as not to interfere
with their studies. They may not become partisans taking sides  with 
warring parties. But they have a right to be left free to hold and
actively to advocate what political opinion they choose. The function
of educational institutions is to impart education to the boys and
girls who choose to join them and therethrough to help to mould their
character, never to interfere with their political or other non-moral
activities outside the school room.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%"><a name="51. NOTES"></a>
The question therefore raised by the strike of the Ahmedabad students
is of first-rate importance and they deserve the sympathy and support
of other scholastic institutions and the public in general. Parents
are as much concerned with the strike as school going boys and girls.
For the Ahmedabad students have, I understand, acted throughout with
the approval of their parents or guardians.</p>

The Working Committee of the Congress has passed a resolution asking
me to frame a scheme for carrying out the Congress pro- gramme
regarding boycott of foreign cloth through khadi. The scheme<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>as
submitted by me to the Secretary is published elsewhere in this
issue. I commend it to the careful attention of the reader and invite
him to offer suggestions for its improvement. In my opinion boycott
of foreign cloth is a comparatively easy thing to accomplish, if
Congressmen would concentrate upon the effort with a will. In order
to enable them to do so a living faith in khadi is an absolute
necessity. If Congressmen still need conversion the scheme cannot be
carried out. I warned the Congress delegates as earnestly as I could
against passing the resolution if they had no faith in the programme.
Notwithstanding the warning they passed the  resolution without
dissent and without protest. That presupposes faith in khadi. If they
have it, the scheme is capable of being worked. Let it be thoroughly</p>

understood that it is not possible to accomplish the boycott through
any other means. Let no one worry about the place of the indigenous
mill-cloth in the boycott. This cloth has taken care of itself and
will take care of itself. What we need to do is to clothe with khadi
those whom we reach. If we speak with two voices, we shall fail in
carrying out the boycott. We shall succeed only in inflating the
prices of indigenous mill-cloth and in tempting unscrupulous
mill-owners to commit frauds upon a gullible public.</p>

Finally I draw the attention of all concerned to my note at the foot
of the scheme. No progress in the prosecution of the Congress
programme is possible unless the Congress house is put in order and
becomes the living structure it was in 1929.</p>

is based upon the assumption that the Congress Committees all over
India will be immediately reorga- nized and that there will be
handsome response to the call for memb- ership and that there will be
full co-operation on the part of all Cong- ress Committees in the
prosecution of the campaign of boycott of <i>foreign cloth through
khadi</i>. It is suggested that if these conditions are fulfilled, it
is possible to achieve this boycott during the year, at any rate to
the extent of making a visible impression upon the imports of foreign

Calcutta to Rangoon? It may be difficult for me to spare 10 days

you mean from Bombay to Rangoon? And if there are sailings from

is the duration and what is the fare from Bombay to Rangoon?</p>

	I have your telegram. After having written to you, I had almost
	reconciled myself to abandoning the proposed European tour and, now
	that you have reconsidered your decision, there is a disinclination
	on my part to undertake the tour. I feel that if we are to do
	anything next year,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>as we ought to, I may not absent myself from India
	during the year, but should do whatever I can to assist to make the
	way clear for next year’s battle. Having moved the constructive
	programme resolution<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, I almost feel [it] like running away if there is any
	work that I can do in the country. If I leave at the end of April, I
	do not expect to return before the middle of October. If then, that
	is, if I am to go through the long programme sketched by me in my
	previous letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  more  especially  if  I  am   to   throw   in  
	America.   The   more, therefore, I contemplate the European tour,
	the more disinclined I feel like facing it this year. Next year, of
	course, may be out of question. I am, therefore, just now on the
	horns of a dilemma.</p>

	I do not want to tax you any further in the matter and I know that I

	a few days.</p>

able to show himself to advantage during the three years he has been

	I have your letter.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>I
	am not sure where I should be in June; but if you do not mind coming
	to the Ashram in my absence, you will be welcome and we would try to
	give you some English classes. You may not know that whilst the
	climate here is not very trying in June, it is not so cool as
	Madanapalle. You may not know too that life at the Ashram is very
	simple I enclose herewith a copy of the rules which all those who
	live at the Ashram, even for a brief period, are expected to follow
	during their stay.</p>

</font></sup>I should   not  have  the  slightest  hesitation in
	acknowledging a mistake if I felt I have made one. I cannot recall
	the whole of the conversation I had with you. But from your
	description of it, I do gather that I was very brief, which I am
	inclined to become if I am to cope with all the work before me 
	including  the visitors, many of whom seem to think that they can
	study Indian problems by a flying visit. I remember to have told you
	that you could not study Indian problems or, for that matter, any
	problem in such a fashion. I would ask you therefore instead of
	expecting an ack- nowledgement of a mistake on my part to extend
	your pity towards one who does not know from day to day how he can
	accomodate visitors who come to him even without appointment and put
	serious questions.</p>

I have your letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>.
Though I know Mr. Dhangopal Mukerjee’s name by correspondence, I
have never had the pleasure of meeting him personally whether in
India or elsewhere. Nor do I pass my time in contemplation as
distinguished from active work. You have rightly guessed that my
active work is my contemplation. I thank you for with it. I am not
ultra strong nor am I ultra weak.</p>

	I have your communications regularly. I am between the devil and the
	deep sea. Whether to undertake the European tour or not is the
	question. My own unaided reason tells me: ‘Don’t go.’ I do not
	know what my heart tells. Miss Petersen writes to me in effect,
	hearing conflicting news about the intended tour, “What can be the
	use of your going to Europe as a messenger from India in bondage?
	You will deliver your message far more truly after India has become
	free”, as she believes, it will be next year, because of the
	Congress resolution. My fate however will have been decided before
	this letter is in your hands. I am simply sharing with you the

I have your letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>.
I have not seen the full text of Pandit Motilal Nehru’s reply in
the Assembly and I think that the inquiry should be addressed to the
Pandit himself and not to me. But I can give you my own opinion upon
the question for whatever it may be worth. In any constitution that I
could endorse, I should certainly be against the confiscation of the
legitimate rights of any community. I would however put stress upon
the word ‘legitimate’. There are many privi- leges enjoyed by
those who belong to the ruling race which privileges have not been
legitimately earned. If therefore I had my way, I should most
decidedly examine every such privilege and those which are discovered
not to have been legitimately obtained should be taken away.</p>

take part in all such other activities of the Ashram as may be

I wish you will not listen to doctors when they object to the Indian
sun. You have heard of Dr. Muthu. Revashankerbhai’s son Dhiru was
suffering from tuberculosis of the bone. After having tried
sanatorium cure in Solon and all the doctors he could get hold of in
Bombay, he sent for Dr. Muthu, paid him a fee of thousand rupees per
day. Dr. Muthu had no better advice to offer than to prescribe open
air, light food and sun treatment. The affected bone was discharging
some time one pound of pus per day. The affected bone had to be
exposed to the sun every morning for a few hours and he had to lie in
the open air the whole day long. He was not even sent to  a
sanatorium. He is now completely cured. European sun may be better,
but the Indian rival is by no means to be despised. Doctors here
suggest the morning sun. They say that ultra-violet rays are best
taken between 8 and 10 o’clock and in summer between 7 and 8. But
it really depends upon the patient’s condition.</p>

As this strike drags on, the students are being tested. The fact that
they have so far remained resolute does credit to them and takes the
country forward. Now I feel inclined to suggest to them that they
should do some work. Why should they not clean the lanes of Ahmedabad
? They should have confidence that ultimately they will attend the
same college honourably. The time is now approaching when the
Principal himself will have to quit. In order to acquire this much
strength, it is necessary for the students to engage themselves in
social service. There is a Congress resolution that the boycott  of
foreign cloth should be effected through khadi. Will they not give up
foreign cloth? Will they not collect it from others? Will they not
wear khadi? Will they not sell khadi from door to door? Students
should give thought to these questions.</p>

I was unaware that silence could mean what this writer has
interpreted it to mean. In recommending silence I implied that no one
should gossip with those sitting around. I certainly did not imply
that he who maintained silence should not sing a <i>bhajan </i>about
Rama in his heart. Moreover, he who cannot thus repeat the name of
Rama in his heart should certainly do so with his tongue. Since the
example of a water-lift has been cited, I consider it necessary to
make it clear that the <i>bhajan </i>which the farmer sings will have
a good effect  on  a cultured listener, but we cannot assume that the
same is always true of the peasant. His lips sing the <i>bhajan </i>by
force of habit but his mind</p>

may well be wandering elsewhere at that time. Hence we cannot acquit
ourselves by singing <i>bhajans </i>aloud while spinning. It is only
when the tongue is always in tune with the heart that the singing of
a <i>bhajan </i>may be regarded as worth while. If we do not keep
this in mind, we should assume with the poet that “all means become
so many obstacles”.</p>

In the <i>Khadi Patrika </i>Shri Vithaldas Jerajani has made an
important suggestion about increasing the sale of khadi, from which I
give the following extracts:<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
This certainly is one way. I feel like suggesting another which
springs from it. Any merchant in a village who wishes to invest even
a small sum should buy khadi worth Rs. 10 or more on condition that
if he could not sell it within a month he would return it at his own
cost to the khadi bhandar. Even those who are not merchants but are
desirous of doing this business can do so. In this there is no risk
involved for either party and khadi can be propagated easily. A
number of good and bad things have thus been propagated in the world.
Within no time tea has been made popular all over India by taking it
within easy reach of every home. But this is propaganda for a vice.
This has resulted in nothing but a loss for the people. In khadi
propaganda, the propagandist, the buyer and the thing — all three
stand to gain and yet we do not find many persons willing to carry on
this propaganda. In these circumstances, if there are a number of
people willing to invest a capital of Rs. 10 and forgo interest on
it, even then we should feel contented. But I must admit that there
is a problem involved in this suggestion. If one man offers a hundred
rupees and suggests that khadi worth ten rupees be propagated in ten
villages, we can hardly afford to take those hundred rupees and our
object too will not be served. My suggestion in effect emphasizes the
necessity of having village workers only and the condition is that
every one of them should invest a capital of ten rupees. This is
because only if such persons are available, can they carry on
propaganda for khadi in</p>

those who can donate a hundred rupees or more, but for khadi-lovers
of one or more villages who will invest ten rupees of their own or
those secured from their friends by virtue of their status and keep
doing propaganda for khadi with that amount. Let Shri Vithaldas and
all other lovers of khadi make this search.</p>

	I have been wanting to write this to you, but could find time to do

	Chhaganlal himself will attend to the work being done in the Ashram

	want you to continue in the Mandir. It is necessary that the

	should believe about Chhaganlal what you do. It is a painful thing
	to me that he cannot work in harmony with you. You, too, are at
	fault in  this,  though unknowingly. Your letters to him are not
	such as will quench a fire. Apart from the fact that Chhaganlal
	cannot work in harmony with you, I see nothing but virtues in him,
	and their number increase, day by day. Write to me and explain where

I had a long and pleasant conversation with Sulochanabehn. She
thinks, and I agree with her, that she is not yet mentally ready to
join the Sangh. In order to know where she stand, I feel she needs to
join some organization and gain experience as an ordinary worker. She
agrees with this and for the present is thinking of doing something
of that kind. Her idea of the Sangh was quite different. She thought
that  a Sangh of the women office-bearers of the existing
organizations should be formed and they should meet for an exchange
of views. I tried to explain to her that this would serve no useful
purpose and I think she was convinced. I have formed a good
impression of her.</p>

The idea of a separate Sangh will have to be dropped for the present.

	I have to add one telegram to the many telegraphic messages that you
	are receiving from various places. This one has been sent by the
	women of Bharat Bhushan Malaviyaji’s Benares Hindu University. I
	have forgotten to bring that telegram here but its purpose is to
	congratulate the women of Gujarat College on their struggle.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
	You have received messages of gratitude today from all quarters but
	much remains to be done by you to deserve these congratulations. In
	a way it is risky to call me to such a meeting. If I have been
	invited here at the instance of the students, they have run a risk;
	and if Dr. Hariprasad has himself called me here then he has taken a
	still greater risk.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
	I am not in a position to give you encouragement. I believe that the
	time is now over when encouragement was needed in order to get work
	out of those who were ready to sacrifice themselves for the <i>yajna
	</i>of swaraj. The time has now come, when each one has to rely on
	his own strength. The struggle that you are carrying  on  today 
	with dignity and the movement which is being carried on all over
	India will be futile if you fall back now, and you will harm the
	entire comm- unity of youth in India.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">

Your struggle—your strike—is not against your Principal. It is
directed against the system under which the present Government and
this college function. It is not that what your Principal has done is
something new. Similar restrictions had been imposed in other colle-
ges also, many had to suffer for disregarding them, many had to pay a
fine and also to resort to flattery. You have been saved from this
unhappy predicament.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
You are a part of the nation and so you have felt that if you go to
the college in spite of the betrayal, you will not uphold the
nation’s self-respect. This will certainly bring in welcome
results. If an honorable settlement can be arrived at, do strive for
it, and if at the same time you act politely there need be no doubt 
about  your success. Your victory lies in your defeat. If you have to
stay out of college for a year it does not imply your defeat. It is
when through a feeling of helplessness you forget your pledge, pay a
fine, resort to flattery and go to the college, that you will have
been defeated; I have come to give you this warning.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I can quite realize that you will feel unhappy when you have to lose
a year or a term. Those who think that they have lost a year or a
term do not realize the value of the strike. You had not calculated
all this from the beginning but now you have realized that great
results can come out of this small struggle. The longer you stay out
(of college), and if you are also polite, the more your strength and
that of the entire country will grow. The strength and vigour of the
students all over India will increase.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I am not exaggerating when I say that you are inaugurating a new era.
But this would be true only if you keep your resolve until the end.
Some members of your committee had met me; I had told them to remain
free from anxiety. You do not even need messages of encouragement.
You have to cultivate your collective strength. It would be better if
instead of returning to college you take up some other activity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Your tactics as outlaws will bring credit to you only when you carry
out successfully the task that you have taken upon yourselves and
also give every moment of your life to it. Do credit to your activity
as outlaws. These many messages of congratulations sent to you, what
do they indicate? Those who have sent these messages say that a
certain type of strength is now needed in India which they themselves
lack, but which can be obtained from you. You can fulfil</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
this desire of theirs and this strength only when you can maintain
the solidarity of your organization.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Previously, I had given you some instructions about this and I remind
you of them again. If you are prepared to make a sacrifice for
securing swaraj, or for the sake of the country’s honour, it is
your dharma to give your full support to the completion of the
programme of the Congress. It is the easiest, the simplest and the
most readily comprehensible. Perhaps it does not interest you and you
feel that it is an outdated thing but much can be derived from such
activities and they have a great value. If that programme does not
appeal to you, draw up another more to your liking.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
If you always have a longing to hear speeches, when assembling on the
sands of the river, you will be making a big mistake and remember
that you will be tired of it in the end. You may like to hear the
lectures in the colleges and to get medals and add the B.A. degree to
your name, but Acharya Kripalani is not going to give you any such
thing here.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
I can say with certainty if you wish to bring glory to this effort,
take up some constructive work. By doing so, you will set an example
to other students. Khadi is the first thing I shall talk about. You
can, render much service by wearing and selling it. Until settlement
is reached, you can carry on that work and collect foreign cloth from
house to house. And if you wish to go a step further, bring it here
and make a bonfire of it. The burning of foreign cloth will bring
much credit to you. You will see an article about the ruin that we
bring upon India by using foreign cloth. There must be at least some
of it left with you. When you take up this work, the Government will
also be convinced that students have now begun to work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
Among Tolstoy’s stories, there is one in which Satan climbs on the
top of a house to give a speech and, falling down, becomes
unconscious. When he collapses, people say he has toppled down.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
Even if you tumble down people will say that you have achieved
something. The nation will certainly admit that students have at any
rate done something. You can take a vow to clean up the streets of
Ahmedabad or do prohibition work. You can undertake many such tasks.</p>

to quote in full the following<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

His official work, great as it has been, has been outweighed by his
unofficial contribution. His transparent sincerity and his passionate
love of his country made him give unstintingly the whole of his
matchless gifts to the service of the cause that took him to South
Africa. The result is a changed atmosphere in that subcontinent and a
smoother passage for his successor. Let me hope that the great
service rendered by the distinguished patriot to the country will be

Circumstances permitting, I had fully intended to undertake my
long-talked-of European tour early this year. But after  the  most
careful consideration and consultation with friends I have come to
the conclusion that the circumstances compel me to give up the tour
for this year at any rate. I dare not think of the next. A dear
Danish friend writes to me saying I could usefully go to Europe only
as a represen- tative of free India. I feel the truth of the remark.
But that is by the way.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Pandit Motilalji, to whom I had mentioned the matter in Cal- cutta,
whilst he at first thought I should not go, has telegraphed
withdrawing his objection, pressing me to fulfil the ‘elaborate
Euro- pean programme’ of which I had given him a rough idea. But
now that I have freedom of action from him, my courage fails me. I
have no voice from within prompting me to go. On the contrary, having
put the constructive resolution before the Congress and  having
received universal support, I feel that I would be guilty of
desertion if  I now went away to Europe. It may be that those who
voted for the resolution never meant to carry it out. It may be that
I shall have to do nothing during the year in respect of the
programme. But I feel that it is not for me to reason thus. I must
not lose faith in the workers. I must, like the immortal Barkis, be
ever ‘willing’. The voice within tells me that I must not only
hold myself in readiness to do what comes my</p>

to me is a great programme. Above all I must prepare myself for the
next year’s struggle, whatever shape it may take.</p>

Though one year’s limit was not of my seeking, though I considered
it to be too short a notice for the nation and for the British
people, I could not make it a point of principle on which to break.
No notice is too short for a vindication of one’s birthright. When
therefore I accepted the change from two years to one, I was quite
serious. For me then I have burnt my boats. What was said by way of
humour to a newspaper correspondent was also seriously meant by me.
If the Nehru Report is not accepted by or on behalf of the British
people before the end of the year, after midnight on December 31st
next, it will cease to have any meaning for me, I must declare myself
an Independencewallah. But if I mean this seriously, I may not leave
India for the best part of this year of probation and preparation. On
the contrary, I must strain every nerve to carry out the preparatory
programme.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The Satyagraha Ashram, now Udyoga Mandir, too, which rightly or
wrongly I claim to be my best creation, demands just now my close
attention, if it is to serve the purpose for which it has been
created. And what message may I deliver to the West whilst it has yet
been hardly delivered in India? Barring those who out of their
partiality for me would have me in Europe and America at any cost,
the peoples of the West would be justified in saying ‘Physician,
heal thyself’. I frankly confess that when I first tempted myself
seriously to entertain a European invitation apart from my keen
desire to see</p>

M. Romain Rolland face to face, I had no idea of seeking help for
India in her fight for freedom, but I had a desire to deliver  the 
message of non-violence. Not that I do not need all the help I can
get from outside for my country, but I do not believe in a begging
expedition for that purpose. That aid will come when we deserve it
and then it will come without the asking. I therefore flattered
myself with the belief that if I went to the West I should be able to
interpret true non-violence to her by word of mouth. But the more I
ponder over the thing, the more unworthy I appear to myself to be. I
need greater preparation and greater self-purification to make me a
worthy vehicle for the transmission of the unbroken message of what
appears to me to be the only way of reaching truth which is God. For
the time being therefore the friends in  the   West  would   pardon 
me   for  my</p>

But with the postponement of my European visit my eyes turn to
Gujarat. The workers of Gujarat can, if they will, get a great deal
done by Gujarat which has contributed its full share since the era of
non-co-operation. I still stand by what I said in 1921. Even if a
single taluk of Gujarat becomes totally ready and is prepared to make
sacrifices, swaraj can be won through them in a trice. It is to be
seen what role Gujarat plays.</p>

Sjt. Jamnalalji’s tour in the South on behalf of Hindi should
result in a double response in men and women desirous of learning
Hindi and in contributions for conducting the Hindi Prachar office.
Accounts received from Madras show that Sjt. Jamnalalji’s
earnestness is producing the desired effect. So long as the leaders
in the South refuse to learn Hindi, it must remain almost cut off
from the rest of India. Let it be clearly understood that Hindi is
not to supplant the indigenous languages but it is to be the medium
of inter-provincial intercourse and the official language of all
all-India organizations. Needless to say that Hindi includes its Urdu
form.</p>

The strike of the students of the Gujarat College, Ahmedabad,
continues with unabated vigour. The students are showing determina-
tion, calmness and solidarity that are worthy of all praise. They are
beginning only now to feel their strength. And I venture to think
that they will feel it still more if they do constructive work. It is
my conviction that our schools and colleges, instead of making us
manly, make us obsequious, timid, indecisive and ballastless.
Man-lin-ess consists not in bluff, bravado or lordliness. It consists
in daring to do the right and facing consequences, whether it is in
matters social, political or other. It consists in deeds not in
words. The students have now before them probably a long time of
waiting. They must not be disheartened if events shape themselves so.
It will then be up to the public to intervene. It will be up to the
student world all over India to vindicate the right which is entirely
on the side of the students. Those who would study the question in
all its fulness can secure from Sjt. Mavlankar copies of all the
relevant papers. The fight of the Ahmedabad students is a fight not
for their own personal rights, it is a fight for the honour of
students in general and therefore in a sense for</p>

And this the students will surely get if they will engage in doing
national activity. They will lose nothing by doing national work.
They need not confine themselves to the Congress programme, if it
does not commend itself to them. The chief thing is to demonstrate
their capacity for holding together and doing independent solid work.
The charge is often brought against us that we are good only at
oratorical displays and fruitless demonstrations, but fail when we
are called upon to <i>do </i>work that requires cohesion,
co-operation, grit and unflinching determination. The students have a
splendid opportunity of falsifying the charge. Will they rise to the
occasion?</p>

They may not lose faith on any account whatsoever.  The  College is
the Nation’s property. If we were not demoralized,  a foreign
Government should never be able to hold our property or make it
practically criminal for students to take part in the nation’s
battle for freedom, which it should be the duty and privilege of 
students to lead.</p>

Govindbabu of Champapurhat, Utkal, tells me that in “The Story of
My Experiments with Truth”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

of Bombay as having taught spinning to Shrimati Gangabehn,
Avantikabai, and Ramibai and that it was he whom I had deputed to
teach these sisters. I am thankful for having had the error pointed
out to me. Now that I have taxed my memory, I do remember that I
asked Govindbabu to teach many in Bombay who wanted to learn
spinning. I have no doubt that in the “Story” there are several
such omissions. Only the “Story” has been written not to issue
certificates to deserving workers but to relate incidents
illustrative of the working of the law of Truth. Those innumerable
workers who have helped me in my pursuit must find in service its own
reward. And Govindbabu has had ample reward in that from an
indifferent spinning teacher he has developed into the founder and
manager of an Ashram in Utkal which is supported almost wholly from
donations given to him by Gujarati patrons. He will be more than
compensated</p>

fewness of candidates need not worry the reader. The restrictions put
upon admissions naturally keep back many from joining. And it is well
that it is so in the beginning. For only those are admitted who among
other things pledge themselves to devote at least 10 years of their
life to village work after completing the course of two years. Needy
candidates receive a stipend of from Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per month.
After completion of the course, they are to receive according to
their proved needs from Rs. 30 to Rs. 75 per month. I commend the
scheme to the attention of all who are desirous of promoting village
reconstruction. They can get a copy of the scheme on application to
the Secretary of the Institution. The Acharya invites the
co-operation of individuals and kindred bodies,</p>

The labourers should fully try for their rights, but in that they
must observe courtesy and peace. The labourers have a right to go on
strike if the arbitrators do not give their award or if the owners do
not go to the arbitrators or if the owners do not act according to
the decisions of the arbitrators. They must not lose patience under
any circumstances after going on strike. They must not intimidate
those who do not join the strike. So far as the strike in the Gujarat
Ginning Mill is concerned, they have to do as they are directed by
Shrimati Anasuyabehn, Mr. Shankerlal Banker and the labour union
secretaries.</p>

	ourselves of whatever help we can get through local influence. If
	difficulties have to faced in obtaining such help it will be our
	penance. It purifies our mind and helps us to serve the people in
	the right manner. When people appreciate out service they readily
	offer monetary help and then if similar help flows in from other
	sources it does so on its own. I am not pained at the volunteers
	having left because they were displeased by your not going out to
	beg.</p>

	But what is our duty now? There is of course the task of preparing
	the Ashram. We are daily making progress in our ideas about this,

You should carefully read the Punjab letter that I have reproduced in
 <i>Youn</i><i>g</i><i> </i><i>India</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>about
what was done in Calcutta. Pro- bably you knew everything of what is
stated in the letter. I wish that you will make it your business
first to put the Congress Comm-ittees in order and then organize the
work in connection with the con- structive programme. Unless by some
unforeseen circumstances there is an honourable settlement with Great
Britain, there will be practically no other party save the party of
independence in the country. But the cry will be ineffective if we
cannot put up a proper fight. If that fight is to be put up through
the Congress, then the Congress must be a living thing. And if it is
to be a non-violent fight then the present con- structive programme
ought to be worked now for all it is worth. Apart from the fact,
therefore, that you, as is your wont, having taken up the
secretaryship, would work your office whole-heartedly, I would like
you on the strength of merits also to give your undivided attention
to the Congress programme. I cannot help feeling that we can do much
with the boycott of foreign cloth through khadi and, if there are
enough workers, also about picketing liquor shops. And  if  these
things are to be done, I think that it is necessary for you to travel
in all the provinces and first put the machinery in order.</p>

As the students—both boys and girls–of Gujarat College gain glory
day by day, their responsibility too increases. To the extent their
strike drags on and their determination increasingly attracts the
entire country’s attention, the people’s expectations of them
rise also. This is exactly like what happened in Bardoli. One can say
that at the outset the strike concerned the students alone. Now it
concerns the whole of India. Hence they cannot relax now. I hear from
all quarters that the majority of students will never break their
pledge. Nevertheless, in accordance with the saying, “The wary is
always happy”, I do not think it is discourteous to sound a note of
warning that the students should remain vigilant and should not
succumb to any kind of temptation or fear.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
It is only if the students jointly undertake some constructive work
that this strike will  bring  about  the  best  result.  There  are 
many such tasks. A letter from a citizen of Ahmedabad about the
insanitary condition of the city appears in this very issue.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>This
gives an adequate description of the filth there. Along with that
letter the writer sent figures of the rate of child mortality which
should put us to shame, but I do not publish them because they are
well known. The president of the Youth League, Dr. Hariprasad
[Desai], has himself given them publicity. The students can easily
undertake the job of removing this filth. By showing the people ways
of doing away with such dirt they can promote the city’s health.
There is altruism as well as glory in this work. Some such work will
serve as an example to every student in India. They will earn the
blessings of the citizens and  I believe this is one fine way of
bringing the strike to an early end. As long as the students do not
engage themselves in some work, the danger of their falling and Mr.
Shirras too will attempt to beat them down.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
This much is clear that the students cannot spend a long time in
merely listening to speeches and lectures. Now every step must be
taken on the assumption that the strike will drag on. It is proper
and necessary that we should be ready for a settlement. We should not
take any drastic step that would preclude a settlement for ever.
Likewise we cannot sit idle waiting for a compromise. Assuring
themselves that it</p>

will come off honourably at the proper time, the students should not
worry about it and should now throw themselves whole-heartedly into
work. If this is done, there is a chance of an early settlement since
the student, burying themselves in work will be regarded as a symbol
of their strength and when their strength is tried, the attempt to
cause disunity among them will stop and attempts will be made only to
please them.</p>

The task of removing the dirt of Ahmedabad has been men- tioned only
by way of example. That work is extremely necessary. Since it is a
local job which can be completed in a short time, should attract all
the greater interest. As it is a local matter, the citizens have a
right to expect that work from the students. It is difficult to get
that work done by hired persons. As volunteers can do it regularly, I
have drawn attention to it. But it would do if the students find out
some other work which they like and approve of. The object that some
consecutive work of public service should be done collectively. I
have already drawn attention to khadi and other activities envisaged
in the Congress programme. All those items of work are to my mind
fine and necessary. I hope that the students will not let go a good
opportunity which has readily presented itself. It is only when the
strength which the students have realized is consolidated, that the
country will benefit by it.</p>

The Dheds, Bhangis and Chamars are our brothers and sisters; our own

criticism of the whole world upon ourselves. If there is any national
awakening in the public of Wadhwan, the citizens should oppose this
clause and if the opposition is not heeded, the people should
renounce a municipality which upholds such caste distinctions.

Every citizen, man and woman, needs to ponder over this letter. There
is nothing new in it. Nor is what is already known put here in a new
form; yet this letter draws attention to something we know. As the
insanitary conditions in Ahmedabad are such as to arouse shame in the
Municipality and the citizens, any amount of attention paid to it
cannot be regarded as too much. If we cannot keep clean our own
courtyard, how then can we help in keeping the entire country clean?
If we leave our courtyard stinking, then there is every chance of a
foul stench arising from our swaraj. Therefore, it is the duty of the
Mun- icipality and the citizens of Ahmedabad to adopt ways and means
of clearing up this filth. It is possible that many who have got used
to this filth may like to tolerate it, but to continue such a slumber
in this age of purification should be a matter of shame. The fact
that there is an economic loss in preserving this filth is something
which should be understood by the wealthy citizens of Ahmedabad.
Because, diseases spread fast owing to uncleanliness and lead to loss
of manpower. When an inanimate engine stops working we start
calculating the loss caused by this stoppage. The body is a living
engine and when it stops working there is a twofold loss. Idleness
following illness is one loss and another is the cost of medical
treatment. And the individual’s loss</p>

pupils in schools about hygiene. This is worth welcoming. If all the
students of Ahmedabad, who are mature, are invited to work for
cleaning up the city’s filth, and if after forming them into
batches, the teachers set out with brooms and buckets, they can
change the appearance of Ahmedabad in no time and the students will
readily receive practical and real education.</p>

Patidar youth. According to our Shastras, a boy of 16 years and over
should be regarded by his parents as a friend whom they should take
in their confidence and not as a child whom they can coerce. But some
parents in our country seem to think that even their grown-up
children are bound to follow every wish of theirs—especially when
it relates to such things as marriage—as if they could have no will
of their own in the matter. And if this is the attitude with regard
to the sons, the plight of the daughters may well be imagined. It
seems to me that in all such contingencies it is not only the right
but the religious duty of young men and young girls not to be afraid
of the parents’ wrath. It has been my experience that when a

takes up a just and right position and adheres to it with absolute
firm- ness there is the least amount of difficulty created by the
parents. When once they realize that the resolution of their children
is absolutely unalterable, they get reconciled to it. For behind  the
parents’ insistence there is always the ultimate hope that it 
would bring their children to their viewpoint. But when this hope  is
 destroyed further insistence becomes meaningless and is therefore
given up. My advice to the young man in question, therefore, is to
refuse to be party to the double sin of marrying a child girl and of
conforming to the evil practice of <i>sata. </i>He must not mind how
much domestic trouble he has to face as a result of his refusal. He
should consider it a virtue to marry outside his sub-caste or to
marry a widow, subject to the necessary limitations.</p>

by Mirabehn for language. For the second edition, the translation was
further revised by a “revered friend who, among many other things,
has the reputation of being an eminent English scholar”. Before
undertaking the task, he had made it a condition—which Mahadev
Desai had accepted—that his name should on no account be given out.

     </font></sup>Sjt. Jairamdas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>, who was one of my fellow-prisoners there, asked me to
put everything else on one side and finish writing the autobiography.
I replied that I had already framed a programme of study for myself,
and that I could not think of doing anything else until this course
was complete. I should<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup>my full term of imprisonment at Yeravda<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup>,
for there was still a year left to complete the task, when I was
discharged. Swami Anand<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  
</font></sup>has now repeated the proposal, and as  I  have  finished
 the history of Satyagraha in South Africa, I am tempted to undertake
the autobiography for <i>Navajivan</i>. The Swami wanted me to write
it separately for publication as a book. But I have no spare time. I
could ony write a chapter week by week. Something has to be written
for <i>Navajivan </i>every week. Why should it not be the
autobiography ? The Swami agreed to the proposal, and here am I hard
at work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
But a God-fearing friend had his doubts, which he shared with me on
my day of silence. “What has set you on this adventure ?”, he
asked. “Writing an autobiography is a practice peculiar to the
West. I know of nobody in the East having written one, except amongst
those who have come under Western influence. And what will you write
? Supposing you reject tomorrow the things you hold as principles
today<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup>, or
supposing you revise in the future your plans of today, is it not
likely that the men who shape their conduct on the authority of your
word, spoken or written, may be misled ? Don’t you think it would
be better<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>not to write anything like an autobiography, at any
rate just yet ?”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
This argument had some effect on me. But it is not my purpose to
attempt a real autobiography. I simply want to tell the story of my
numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing
but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape
of an aut-obiography. But I shall not mind, if every page of it

This argument had some effect on me. But it is not my purpose to
attempt a real autobiography. I simply want to tell the story of my
numerous experiments with truth, and as my life consists of nothing
but those experiments, it is true that the story will take the shape
of an aut-obiography. But I shall not mind, if every page of it
speaks only of my experiments. I believe, or at any rate flatter
myself with the belief, that a connected account of all these
experiments will not be without benefit to the reader. My experiments
in the political field are now known, not only to India, but to a
certain extent to the ‘civilized’ world. For me, they have not
much value; and the title of ‘Mahatma’ that they have won for me
has, therefore, even less. Often the title has deeply pained me; and
there is not a moment I can recall when it may be said to have
tickled me. But I should certainly like to narrate my experiments in
the spiritual field which are known only to myself, and from which I
have derived such power as I possess for working in the political
field. If the experiments are really spiritual, then there can be no
room for self-praise. They can only add to my humility. The more  I
reflect and look back on the past, the more vividly do I feel my
limitations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 86%">
What I want to achieve—what I have been striving and pining to
achieve these thirty years—is self-realization, to see God face to
face, to attain  <i>moksha</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>I live and move and have my being in pursuit of this
goal. All that I do by way of speaking and writing, and all my
ventures in the political field, are directed to this same end. But
as I have all along believed that what is possible for one is
possible for all, my experiments have not been conducted in the
closet, but in the open; and I do not think that this fact detracts
from their spiritual value. There are some things which are known
only to oneself and one’s Maker. These are clearly
incommunicable<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup>.
The experiments I am about to relate are not such. But they are
spiritual, or rather moral; for the essence of religion is morality.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Only those matters of religion<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

can be comprehended as much by children as by older people, will be
included in this story. If  I can narrate them in a dispassionate and
humble spirit, many other experimenters will find in them provision
for their onward march. Far be it from me to claim any degree of
perfection for these exp- eriments. I claim for them nothing more
than does a scientist who, though he conducts his experiments with
the utmost accuracy, fore- thought and minuteness, never claims any
finality about his con-clu- sions, but keeps an open mind regarding
them. I have gone through deep self-introspection, searched myself 
through  and  through,   and</p>

from claiming any finality or infallibility about my conclusions. One
claim I do indeed make and it is this. For me they appear to be abs-
olutely correct, and seem for the time being to be final. For if they
were not, I should base no action on them. But at every step I have
carried out the process of acceptance or rejection and acted
accordingly. And so long as my acts satisfy my reason and my heart, I
must firmly adhere to my original conclusions.</p>

If I had only to discuss academic principles, I should clearly not
attempt an autobiography. But my purpose being to give an account of
various practical applications of these principles, I have given the
chapters I propose to write<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</i><i>M</i><i>y</i><i> </i><i>Experiments </i><i>with Truth. </i>These
will of course include experiments with non-viole- nce, celibacy and
other principles of conduct believed to be distinct from truth. But
for me, truth is the sovereign principle, which includes num-erous
other principles. This truth is not only  truthfulness  in word, but
truthfulness in thought also, and not only the relative truth of our
conception, but the Absolute Truth, the Eternal Principle, that is
God. There are innumerable definitions of God, because His
manifestations are innumerable. They overwhelm me with wonder and awe
and for a moment stun me. But I worship God as Truth only. I have not
yet found Him, but I am seeking after Him. I am prepared to sacrifice
the things dearest to me in pursuit of this quest. Even if the
sacrifice demanded be my very life, I hope I may be prepared to give
it. But as long as I have not realized this Absolute Truth, so long
must  I hold by the relative truth as I have conceived it. That
relative truth must, meanwhile, be my beacon, my shield and buckler.
Though this path is strait and narrow and sharp as the razor’s
edge, for me it has been the quickest and easiest. Even my Himalayan
blunders have seemed trifling to me because I have kept strictly to
this path. For the path has saved me from coming to grief<font size="1">T9
</font>, and I have gone forward according to my light. Often in my
progress I have had faint glimpses of the Absolute Truth, God, and
daily the conviction is growing upon me that He alone is real and all
else is unreal. Let those, who wish<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, realize how the conviction has grown upon me; let them
share my experiments and share also my conviction if they can. The
further conviction has been growing upon me that whatever is possible
for me is possible even for a child, and I have sound reasons for
saying so. The instruments for the quest of truth are as simple as
they are difficult. They may appear quite impossible to an arrogant
person, and quite possible to an innocent child. The seeker after
truth should be humble than the dust. The world crushes the dust

Ota Gandhi married a second time, having lost his first wife. He had
four sons by his first wife and two by his second wife. I do not
think that in my childhood I ever felt or knew that these sons of Ota
Gandhi were not all of the same mother. The fifth of these six
brothers was Karamchand Gandhi, alias Kaba Gandhi, and the sixth was
Tulsidas Gandhi. Both these brothers were Prime Ministers in
Porbandar, one after the other. Kaba Gandhi was my father. He was<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

impartiality in his family as well as outside. His loyalty to the
State was well known. An Assistant Political Agent spoke insultingly
of the Rajkot Thakore Saheb, his chief, and he stood up to the
insult. The Agent was angry and asked Kaba Gandhi to apologize. This
he  refused to do and was therefore kept under detention for a few

questions and in managing hundreds of men. Of religious training he
had very little, but he had had that kind of religious culture which
frequent visits to temples and listening to religious discourses make
available to many Hindus. In his last days he began reading the <i>Gita

The outstanding impression my mother has left on my memory is that of
saintliness<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

taking her meals without her daily prayers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>.
Going to   <i>Havel</i><i>i</i>—the Vaishnava temple—was one of
her daily duties. As far as my memory can go back, I do not remember
her having ever missed the <i>Chaturmas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. She would take the hardest vows and keep them without
flinching. Illness was no excuse for relaxing them. I can recall her
once falling ill when she was observing the <i>Chandrayana</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>vow,
but the illness was not allowed to interrupt the observance. To keep
two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her. Living on one meal
a day during <i>Chaturmas </i>was a habit with her. Not content with
that, she fasted every alternate day during one <i>Chaturmas</i>.
During another <i>Chaturmas </i>she vowed not to have food without
seeing the sun. We children on those days would stand, staring at the
sky, waiting to announce the appearance of the sun to our mother.

does  not  condescend to show his face. And I remember days when, at

difficulty that I got through the multiplication tables. The fact
that I recollect nothing more of those days than having learnt, in
company with other boys, to call our teacher all kinds of names,
would strongly suggest that my intellect must have been sluggish, and

I must have been about seven when my father left Porbandar for Rajkot
to become a member of the Rajasthanik Court. There I was put into a
primary school, and I can well recollect those days, including the
names and other particulars of the teachers who taught me. As at
Porbandar, so here, there is hardly anything to note about my
studies. I could only have been a mediocre student. From this school
I went to the suburban school and thence to the high school, having
already reached my twelfth year. I do not remember having ever told a
lie during this short period, either to teachers or to my
school-mates<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>.
I used to be very shy and avoided all company. My books and my
lessons were my sole companions. To be at school at the stroke of the
hour and to run back home as soon as the school closed—that was my
daily habit. I literally ran back, because I could not bear to talk
to anybody. I was even afraid lest anyone should poke fun at me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
There is an incident which occurred at the examination during my
first year at the high school and which is worth recording. Mr.
Giles, the Educational Inspector, had come on a visit of inspection.
He had set us five words to write as a spelling exercise. One of the
words was ‘kettle’. I had mis-spelt it. The teacher tried to
prompt me with the point of his boot, but I would not be prompted. It
was beyond me to see that he wanted me to copy the spelling from my
neighbour’s slate, for I had thought that the teacher was there to
supervise us against copying. The result was that all the boys,
except myself, were found to have spelt every word correctly. Only I
had been stupid. The</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
teacher tried later to bring this stupidity home to me, but without
effect. I never could learn the art of ‘copying’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Yet the incident did not in the least diminish my respect for my
teacher. I was by nature, blind to the faults of elders. Later I came
to know of many other failings of this teacher, but my regard for him
remained the same. For I had learnt to carry out the orders of
elders, not to scan their actions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Two other incidents belonging to the same period have always clung to
my memory. As a rule I had a distaste for any reading beyond my
school books. The daily lessons had to be done, because I disliked
being taken to task by my teacher as much as I disliked deceiving
him. Therefore I would do the lessons, but often without my mind in
them. Thus when even the lessons could not  be  done properly, there
was of course no question of any extra reading. But somehow my eyes
fell on a book purchased by my father. It was <i>Shravana Pitribhakti
Nataka </i>(a play about Shravana’s devotion to his parents). I
read it with intense interest. There came to our place about the same
time itinerant showmen. One of the pictures I was shown was of
Shravana carrying, by means of slings fitted for his shoulders, his
blind parents on a pilgrimage. The book and the picture left an
indelible impression on my mind. Here is an example for you to copy,’
I said to myself. The agonized lament of the parents over Shravan’s
death is still fresh in my memory. The melting tune moved me deeply,
and I played it on a concertina which my father had purchased for me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
There was a similar incident connected with another play. Just about
this time, I had secured my father’s permission to see a play
performed by a certain dramatic company. This play—<i>Harishchan-
</i><i>dr</i><i>a</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>—captured my heart. I could never be tired of seeing
it. But how often should I be permitted to go ? It haunted me and I
must have acted Harishchandra<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
myself times without number. ‘Why should not all be truthful like
Harishchandra?’ was the question I asked myself day and night. To
follow truth and to go through all the ordeals Harishchandra went
through was the one ideal it inspired in me. I literally believed in
the story of Harishchandra<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>.
The thought of it all often made me weep. My common sense tells me
today that Harishchandra could not have been a historical character.
Still both Harishchandra and Shravana are living realities for me,
and I am sure I should be moved as before if I were to read those
plays again today.</p>

Much as I wish that I had not to write this chapter, I know that I
shall have to swallow many such bitter draughts in the course of this
narrative. And I cannot do otherwise, if I claim to be a worshipper
of Truth. It is my painful duty to have to record here my marriage at
the age of thirteen. As I see the youngsters of the same age about me
who are under my care, and think of my own marriage, I am inclined to
pity myself and to congratulate them on having escaped my lot. I can

Let the reader make no mistake. I was married, not betrothed. For in
Kathiwad there are two distinct rites—betrothal and marriage.
Betrothal is a preliminary promise on the part of the parents of the
boy and the girl to join them in marriage, and it is not inviolable.
The death of the boy entails no widowhood on the girl. It is an
agreement purely between the parents, and the children have no
concern with it. Often they are not even informed of it. It appears
that I was betrothed thrice, though without my knowledge. I was told
that two girls chosen for me had died in turn, and therefore I infer
that I was betrothed three times. I have a faint recollection,
however, that the third betro- that took place in my seventh year.
But I do not recollect having been informed about it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

It will be remembered that we were three brothers. The first was
already married. The elders decided to marry my second brother, who
was two or three years my senior, a cousin, possibly a year older,
and me, all at the same time. In doing so there was no thought of our
welfare, much less our wishes. It was purely a question of their own
convenience and economy.</p>

Marriage among Hindus is no simple matter. The parents of the bride
and the bridegroom often bring themselves to ruin over it. They waste
their substance, they waste their time. Months are taken up over the
preparations—in making clothes and ornaments and in preparing
budgets for dinners. Each tries to outdo the other in the number and
variety of courses to be prepared. Women, whether they have a voice
or no, sing themselves hoarse, even get ill, and disturb the peace of
their neighbours. These in their turn quietly put up with  all  the
turmoil and bustle, all the dirt and filth, representing the remains
of the feasts, because they know that a time will come when they also
will be behaving in the same manner.</p>

thrice. My father and my uncle were both old, and we were the last
children they had to marry. It is likely that they wanted to have the
last best time of their lives. In view of all these considerations, a
triple wedding was decided upon, and as I have said before, months
were taken up in preparation for it.</p>

It was only through these preparations that we got warning of the

prospect of good clothes to wear, drum beating, marriage processions,
rich dinners and a strange girl to play with. The carnal desire came

are some amusing details of the preliminaries to the final
drama—e.g., smearing our bodies all over with turmeric paste—but
I must omit them.</p>

My father was a Diwan, but nevertheless a servant, and all the more
so because he was in favour with the Thakore Saheb. The latter would
not let him go until the last moment. And when he did so, he ordered
for my father special stage-coaches, reducing the journey by two
days. But the fates had willed otherwise. Porbandar is 120 miles from
Rajkot—a cart journey of five days. My father did the distance in
three, but the coach toppled over in the third stage, and he
sustained severe injuries. He arrived bandaged all over. Both his and
our interest in the coming event was half destroyed, but the ceremony
had to be gone through. For how could the marriage dates be changed ?
However, I forgot my grief over my father’s injuries in the
childish amusement of the wedding.</p>

My father put on a brave face in spite of his injuries, and took full
part in the wedding. As I think of it, I can even today call before
my mind’s eye the places where he sat as he went through  the
different details of the ceremony. Little did I dream then that one
day  I should severely criticize my father for having married me as a
child. Everything on that day seemed to me right and proper and
pleasing. There was also my own eagerness to get married. And as
everything that my father did then struck me as beyond reproach, the
recollection of those things is fresh in my memory. I can picture to
myself, even today, how we sat on our wedding dais, how we performed
the <i>Sapta- padi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup>into each other’s mouth, and how we began to live
together, and oh! that first night. Two innocent children all
unwittingly hurled themselves into the ocean of life. My brother’s
wife had thorough- ly coached me about my behaviour on the first
night. I do not know who had coached my wife. I have never asked her
about it, nor am I inclined to do so now. The reader may be sure that
we were too nervous to face each other. We were certainly too shy.
How was I to talk to her, and what was I to say ? The coaching could
not carry me far. But no coaching is really necessary in such
matters. The impressions of the former birth are potent enough to
make all  coaching superfluous. We gradually began to know each
other, and to speak freely together. We were the same age. But I took
no time in assuming the authority of a husband.</p>

About the time of my marriage, little pamphlets costing a pice, or a
pie (I now forget how much), used to be issued, in which conjugal
love, thrift, child marriages, and other such subjects were
discussed. Whenever I came across any of these, I used to go through
them cover to cover, and it was a habit with me to forget what I did
not like, and to carry out in practice whatever I liked. Lifelong
faithfulness to the wife, inculcated in these booklets as the duty of
the husband, remained permanently imprinted on my heart. Furthermore,
the passion for truth was innate in me, and to be false to her was
therefore out of the question. And then there was very little chance
of my being faithless at that tender age.</p>

should be pledged to be faithful to my wife, she also should be 
pledged to be faithful to me,’ I said to myself. The thought made
me a jealous husband. Her duty was easily converted into my right to
exact faithfulness from her, and if it had to be exacted, I should be
watchfully tenacious of the right. I had absolutely  no  reason  to
suspect my wife’s fidelity, but jealousy does not wait for reasons.
I must needs be for ever on the look-out regarding her movements, and
therefore she could not go anywhere without my permission. This sowed
the seeds of a bitter quarrel between us. The restraint was virtually
a sort of imprisonment. And Kasturbai was not the girl to brook any
such thing. She made it a point to go out whenever and wherever she
liked. More restraint on my part resulted in more liberty being taken
by her and in my getting more and more cross. Refusal to speak to one
another thus became the order of the day  with  us, married children.
I think it was quite innocent of Kasturbai to have taken those
liberties with my restrictions. How could a guileless girl brook any
restraint on going to the temple or on going on visits to friends ?
If I had the right to impose restrictions on her, had not she also a
similar right ? All this is clear to me today. But at that time I had
to make good my authority as a husband !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Let not the reader think, however, that ours was a life of unrelieved
bitterness. For my severities were all based on  love.  I wanted to
<i>make </i>my wife an ideal wife. My ambition was to <i>make </i>her
live a pure life, learn what I learnt, and identify her life and
thought with mine.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I do not know whether Kasturbai had any such ambition. She was
illiterate. By nature she was simple, independent, persevering and,
with me at least, reticent. She was not impatient of her ignorance
and I do not recollect my studies having ever spurred her to go in
for a sim- ilar adventure. I fancy, therefore, that my ambition was
all one-sided. My passion was entirely centred on one woman, and I
wanted it to be reciprocated. But even if there were no reciprocity,
it could not be all unrelieved misery because there was active love
on one side at least.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must say I was passionately fond of her. Even at school I used to
think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting
was ever haunting me. Separation was unbearable. I used to keep her
awake till late in the night with my idle talk. If with this
devouring passion there had not been in me a burning attachment to
duty, I should either have fallen a prey to disease and premature
death, or have sunk into a burdensome existence. But the appointed
tasks had to be gone through every morning, and lying to anyone was
out of the question. It was this last thing<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that

I have already said that Kasturbai was illiterate. I was very anxious
to teach her, but lustful love left me no time. For one thing the
teaching had to be done against her will, and that too at night. I
dared not meet her in the presence of the elders, much less talk to
her. Kathiawad had then, and to a certain extent has even today, its
own peculiar, useless and barbarous <i>purdah</i>. Circumstances were
thus unfavourable. I must therefore confess that most of my efforts
to instruct Kasturbai in our youth were unsuccessful. And when I
awoke from the sleep of lust, I had already launched forth into
public life, which did not leave me much spare time. I failed
likewise to instruct her through private tutors. As a result,
Kasthurbai can now with difficulty write simple letters and
understand simple Gujarati. I am sure that, had my love for her been
absolutely untainted with lust, she would be a learned lady today;
for I could then have conquered her dislike for studies. I know that
nothing is impossible for pure love.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I have mentioned one circumstance that more or less saved me from the
disasters of lustful love. There is another worth noting. Numerous
examples have convinced me that God ultimately saves him whose motive
is pure. Along with the cruel custom of child marriages, Hindu
society has another custom which to a certain extent diminishes the
evils of the former. Parents do not allow young couples to stay
together long. The child-wife spends more than half her time at her
father’s place. Such was the case with us. That is to say, during
the first five years of our married life (from the age of 13 to 18),
we could not have lived together longer than an aggregate period of
three years. We would hardly have spent six months together, when
there would be a call to my wife from her parents. Such calls were
very unwelcome in those days, but they saved us both. At the age of
eighteen I went to England, and this meant a long and healthy spell
of separation. Even after my return from England we hardly stayed
together longer than six months. For I had to run up and down between
Rajkot and Bombay. Then came the call from South Africa, and that
found me already fairly free from the carnal appetite.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 95%">
I have already said that I was learning at the high school when I was
married. We three brothers were learning at the same school. The
eldest brother was in a much higher class, and the brother who was
married at the same time as I was, only one class ahead of me. Mar-
riage resulted in both of us wasting a year. Indeed the result was
even worse for my brother, for he gave up studies  altogether. Heaven
knows how many youths are in the same plight as he. Only in our
present Hindu society do studies and marriage go thus hand in hand.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
My studies were continued. I was not regarded as a dunce at the high
school. I always enjoyed the affection of my teachers. Certifi- cates
of progress and character used to be sent to the parents every year.
I never had a bad certificate. In fact I even won prizes after I
passed out of the second standard. In the fifth and sixth I obtained
scholarships of rupees four and ten respectively, an achievement for
which I have to thank good luck more than my merit. For the
scholarships were not open to all, but reserved for the best boys
amongst those coming from the Sorath Division of Kathiawad. And in
those days there could not have been many boys from Sorath in a class
of forty to fifty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
My own recollection is that I had not any high regard for my ability.
I used to be astonished whenever I won prizes and scholar- ships. But
I very jealously guarded my character. The least little ble- mish
drew tears from my eyes. When I merited, or seemed to the teacher to
merit, a rebuke, it was unbearable for me. I remember hav- ing once
received corporal punishment. I did not so much mind the punishment,
as the fact that it was considered my desert. I wept piteously. That
was when I was in the first or second standard. There was another
such incident during the time when I was in the seventh standard.
Dorabji Edulji Gimi was the head master then. He was pop- ular among
boys, as he was a disciplinarian, a man of method and a good teacher.
He had made gymnastics and cricket compulsory for boys of the upper
standards. I disliked both. I never took party in any exercise,
cricket or football, before they were made compulsory. My shyness was
one of the reasons for this aloofness, which I now see was wrong. I
then had the false notion that gymnastics had nothing to do with
education. Today I know that physical training should have as much
place in the curriculum as mental training.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I may mention, however, that I was none the worse for  abstaining
from exercise. That was because I had read in books about the
benefits of long walks in the open air, and having liked the advice,
I had<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>formed
a habit of taking walks, which has still remained with me. These
walks gave me a fairly hardy constitution.</p>

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>reason
of my dislike for gymnastics was my keen desire to serve as nurse to
my father. As soon as the school closed, I would hurry home and begin
serving him. Compulsory exercise came  directly in the way of this
service. I requested Mr. Gimi to exempt me from gymnastics so that I
might be free to serve my father. But he would not listen to me. Now
it so happened that one Saturday, when we had school in the morning,
I had to go from home to the school for gymnastics at 4 o’clock in
the afternoon. I had no watch, and the clouds deceived me. Before I
reached the school the boys had all left.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
The next day Mr. Gimi, examining the roll, found me marked absent.
Being asked the reason for absence, I told him what had happened. He
refused to believe me and ordered me to pay a fine of one or two
annas (I cannot now recall how much).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was convicted of lying ! That deeply pained me. How was I to prove
my innocence ? There was no way. I cried in deep anguish. I saw that
a man of truth must also be a man of care. This was the first and
last instance of my carelessness in school. I have a faint recollec-
tion that I finally succeeded in getting the fine remitted. The
exemp- tion from exercise was of course obtained, as my father wrote
himself to the head master saying that he wanted me at home after
school.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But though I was none the worse for having neglected exercise,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>I am still paying the penalty of another neglect. I do
not know whence  I got the notion that good handwriting was not a
necessary part of education, but I retained it until I went to
England. When later, especially in South Africa, I saw the beautiful
handwriting of lawyers and young men born and educated in South
Africa, I was ashamed of myself and repented of my neglect. I saw
that bad handwriting should be regarded as a sign of an imperfect
education. I tried  later  to improve mine, but it was too late. I
could never repair the neglect of my youth. Let every young man and
woman be warned by my  example, and understand that good handwriting
is a necessary part of education.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
am now of opinion that children should first be taught the art of
drawing before learning how to write. Let the child learn his letters
by observation as he does different objects, such as flowers, birds,
etc., and let him learn handwriting only after he has learnt to draw
objects. He will then write a beautifully formed hand.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Two   more   reminiscences   of   my   school   days<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>are
  worth recording. I had lost one year because of my marriage, and 
the  teacher wanted me to make good the loss by skipping a class—a
privilege usually allowed to industrious boys. I therefore had only
six months in the third standard and was promoted to the fourth after
the examinations which are followed by the summer vacation. English
became the medium of instruction in most subjects from the fourth
standard. I found myself completely at sea. Geometry was a new
subject in which I was not particularly strong, and the English
medium made it still more difficult for me. The teacher taught the
subject very well, but I could not follow him. Often I would lose
heart and think of going back to the third standard, feeling that the
packing of  two years’ studies into a single year was too
ambitious. But this would discredit not only me, but also the
teacher; because, counting on my industry, he had recommended my
promotion. So the fear of the double discredit kept me at my post.
When, however, with much effort</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
I reached the thirteenth proposition of Euclid, the utter simplicity
of the subject was suddenly revealed to me. A subject which  only
required a pure and simple use of one’s reasoning powers could not
be difficult. Ever since that time geometry has been both easy and
interesting for me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Samskrit, however, proved a harder task. In geometry there was
nothing to memorize, whereas in Samskrit, I thought, everything had
to be learnt by heart. This subject also was commenced from the
fourth standard. As soon as I entered the sixth I became
disheartened. The teacher was a hard taskmaster, anxious, as I
thought, to force the boys. There was a sort of rivalry going on
between the Samskrit and the Persian teachers. The Persian teacher
was lenient. The boys used to talk among themselves that Persian was
very easy and the Persian teacher very good and considerate to the
students. The ‘easiness’ tempted me and one day I sat in the
Persian class. The Samskrit teacher was grieved. He called me to his
side and said: ‘How can you forget that you are the son of a
Vaishnava<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>father ? Won’t you learn the language of your own
religion ? If you have any difficulty, why not come to me ? I want to
teach you students Samskrit to the best of my ability. As you proceed
further, you will find in it things of absorbing interest. You should
not lose heart. Come and sit again in the Samskrit class.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
This kindness put me to shame. I could not disregard my teacher’s
affection. Today I cannot but think with gratitude of Krishnashankar
Pandya. For if I had not acquired the little Samskrit that I learnt
then, I should have found it difficult to take any interest in our
sacred books. In fact I deeply regret that I was not able to acquire
a more thorough knowledge of the language, because I have since
realized that every Hindu boy and girl should possess sound Samskrit
learning.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
It is now my opinion that in all Indian curricula of higher education
there should be a place for Hindi, Samskrit, Persian, Arabic and
English, besides of course the vernacular. This big list need not
frighten anyone. If our education were more systematic, and the boys
free from the burden of having to learn their subjects through a
foreign medium, I am sure learning all these languages would not be
an irksome task, but a perfect pleasure. A scientific knowledge of
one language makes a knowledge of other languages comparatively easy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In reality, Hindi, Gujarati and Samskrit may be regarded as one
language, and Persian and Arabic also as one. Though Persian</p>

I dared not go against the opinion of my mother and my eldest
brother. Nevertheless I pleaded with them saying, ‘I know he has
the weaknesses you attribute to him, but you do not know his virtues.
He cannot lead me astray, as my association with him is meant to
reform him. For I am sure that if he reforms his ways, he will be a
splendid man. I beg you not to be anxious on my account.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I do not think this satisfied them, but they accepted my explana-
tion and let me go my way.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have seen since that I had calculated wrongly<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup>.
A reformer can-not afford to have close intimacy with him whom he
seeks to reform. True friendship is an identity of souls rarely to be
found in this world. Only between like natures can friendship be
altogether worthy and endu-ring. Friends react on one another. Hence
in friendship there is very little scope for reform. I am of opinion
that all exclusive intimacies are to be avoided; for man takes in
vice far more readily than virtue. And he who would be friends with
God<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>must remain alone, or make the whole world his
friend. I may be wrong, but my effort to cultivate in intimate
friendship proved a failure.</p>

A wave of ‘reform’ was sweeping over Rajkot at the time when I
first came across this friend. He informed me that many of our
teachers were secretly taking meat and wine. He also named many</p>

well-known people of Rajkot as belonging to the same company. There
were also, I was told, some high-school boys among them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was surprised and pained. I asked my friend the reason and he
explained it thus : ‘We are a weak people because we do not eat
meat. The English are able to rule over us, because they are
meat-eaters. You know how hardy I am, and how great a runner too. It
is because I am a meat-eater. Meat-eaters do not have boils or
tumours, and even if they sometimes happen to have any, these heal
quickly. Our teachers and other distinguished people who eat meat are
no fools. They know its virtues. You should do likewise. There is
nothing like trying. Try, and see what strength it gives.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
All these pleas on behalf of meat-eating were not advanced at a
single sitting. They represent the substance of a long and elaborate
argument which my friend was trying to impress upon me from time to
time. My elder brother had already fallen. He therefore supported my
friend’s argument. I certainly looked feeble-bodied by the side of
my brother and this friend. They were both hardier, physically
stronger, and more daring. This friend’s exploits cast a spell over
me. He could run long distances and extraordinarily fast. He was an
adept in high and long jumping. He could put up with any amount of
corporal punishment. He would often display his exploits to me and,
as one is always dazzled when he sees in others the qualities that he
lacks himself, I was dazzled by this friend’s exploits. This  was
followed by a strong desire to be like him. I could hardly jump or
run. Why should not I also be as strong as he ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Moreover, I was a coward. I used to be haunted by the fear of
thieves, ghosts and serpents. I did not dare to stir out of doors at
night. Darkness was a terror to me. It was almost impossible for me
to sleep in the dark, as I would imagine ghosts coming from one
direction, thieves from another and serpents from a third. I could
not therefore bear to sleep without a light in the room. How could I
disclose my fears to my wife, no child, but already at the threshold
of youth, sleeping by my side ? I knew that she had more courage than
I, and I felt ashamed of myself. She knew no fear of serpents and
ghosts. She could go out anywhere in the dark. My friend knew all
these weak- nesses of mine. He would tell me that he could hold in
his hand live serpents, could defy thieves and did not believe in
ghosts. And all this was, of course,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the result of eating meat.</p>

on me that meat-eating was good, that it would make me strong and

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A day was thereupon fixed for beginning the experiment. It had to be
conducted in secret.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>The
Gandhis were Vaishnavas. My parents were particularly staunch
Vaishnavas. They would regularly visit the <i>Haveli</i>. The family
had even its own temples. Jainism was strong in Gujarat, and its
influence was felt everywhere and on all occasions. The opposition to
and abhorrence of meat-eating that existed  in Gujarat among the
Jains and Vaishnavas were to be seen nowhere else in India or outside
in such strength. These were the traditions in which  I was born and
bred. And I was extremely devoted to my parents. I knew that the
moment they came to know of my having eaten meat, they would be
shocked to death. Moreover, my love of truth made me extra
cautious.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
cannot say that I did not know then that I should have to deceive my
parents if I began eating meat.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>But
my mind was bent on the ‘reform’. It was not a question of
pleasing the palate. I did not know that it had a particularly good
relish. I wished to be strong and daring and wanted my countrymen
also to be such, so that we might defeat the English and make India
free. The word ‘swaraj’ I had not yet heard. But I knew what
freedom meant. The frenzy of the ‘reform’ blinded me. And having
ensured secrecy, I persuaded  myself that mere hiding the deed from
parents was no departure from truth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.22cm; line-height: 95%">
So the day came. It is difficult fully to describe my condition.
There were, on the one hand, the zeal for ‘reform’ and the
novelty of making a momentous departure in life. There was, on the
other, the shame of hiding like a thief to do this very thing. I
cannot say which of the two swayed me more. We went in search of a
lonely spot by the river, and there I saw, for the first time in my
life—meat. There was baker’s bread also. I relished neither. The
goat’s meat was as tough as leather. I simply could not eat it. I
was sick and had to leave off eating.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had a very bad night afterwards. A horrible nightmare haunted me.
Every time I dropped off to sleep it would seem as though a live goat
were bleating inside me, and I would jump up full of remorse. But
then I would remind myself that meat-eating was a duty and so become
more cheerful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
My friend was not a man to give in easily. He now began to cook
various delicacies with meat, and dress them neatly. And for dining,
no longer was the secluded spot on the river chosen, but a State
house, with its dining-hall, and tables and chairs, about which my
friend had made arrangements in collusion with the chief cook there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This bait had its effect. I got over my dislike for bread, forswore
my compassion for the goats, and became a relisher of meat-dishes, if
not of meat itself. This went on for about a year. But not more than
half a dozen meat-feasts were enjoyed in all; because the State house
was not available every day, and there was the obvious difficulty
about frequently preparing expensive savoury meat-dishes. I had no
money to pay for this ‘reform’. My friend had therefore always to
find the wherewithal. I had no knowledge where he found it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>But find it he did, because he was bent on turning me
into a meat-eater<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>.
But even his means must have been limited, and hence these feasts had
necessarily to be few and far between.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Whenever I had occasion to indulge in these surreptiitous feasts,
dinner at home was out of the question. My mother would naturally ask
me to come and take my food and want to know the reason why I did not
wish to eat. I would say<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to her, ‘I have no appetite today; there is
something wrong with my digestion.’ It was not without compunction
that I devised these pretexts. I knew I was lying, and lying to my
mother. I also knew that, if my mother and father came to know of my
having become a meat-eater, they would be deeply shocked. This
knowledge was gnawing at my heart.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Therefore I said to myself : ‘Though it is essential to eat meat,
and also essential to take up food reform in the country yet
deceiving and lying to one’s father and mother is worse than not
eating meat. In their lifetime, therefore, meat-eating must be out of
 the  question. When they are no more and I have found freedom, I
will eat meat openly, but until that moment arrives I will abstain
from it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This decision I communicated to my friend, and I have never since
gone back to meat. My parents never knew that two of their sons had
become meat-eaters.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I abjured meat out of the purity of my desire not to lie to my
parents, but I did not abjure the company of my friend. My zeal for
reforming him had proved disastrous for me, and all the time I was
completely unconscious of the fact.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The same company would have led me into faithlessness to my wife. But
I was saved by the skin of my teeth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
was almost struck blind and dumb in this den of vice. I sat near the
woman on her bed, but I was tongue-tied. She naturally lost patience
with me, and showed me the door, with abuses and insults. I then felt
as though my manhood had been injured, and wished to sink into the
ground for shame. But I have ever since given thanks to God for
having saved me. I can recall four more similar incidents in my life,
and in most of them my good fortune,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>rather

     </font></sup>From   a   strictly   ethical   point   of   view, 
all   these occasions must be regarded as moral lapses; for the
carnal desire was there, and it was as good as the act. But from the
ordinary point of view, a man who is saved from physically committing
sin is regarded as saved. And I was saved only in that sense. There
are some actions from which an escape is a godsend both for the man
who escapes and for those about him. Man, as soon as he gets back his
consciousness of right, is thankful to the Divine mercy for the
escape. As we know that a man often succumbs to temptation, however
much he may resist it, we also know<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that
Providence often intercedes and saves him in spite of himself. How
all this happens—how far a man is free and how far a creature of
circumstances—how far free will comes into play and where fate
enters on the scene—all this is a mystery and will remain a
mystery.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But to go on with the story. Even this was far from opening my eyes
to the viciousness of my friend’s company. I therefore had many
more bitter draughts in store for me, until my eyes were actually
ope- ned by an ocular demonstration of some of his lapses quite
unexpec- ted by me. But of them later, as we are proceeding
chronologically<font size="1">T9</font>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One thing, however, I must mention now, as it pertains to the same
period. One of the reasons of my differences with my wife was
undoubtedly the company of this friend. I was both a devoted and a
jealous husband, and this friend fanned the flame of my suspicions
about my wife.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I never could doubt his veracity. And I never have
forgiven myself the violence of which I have been guilty in often
having pained my wife by acting on his information.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Perhaps
only a Hindu wife would tolerate these hardships, and that is why I
have regarded woman as an incarnation of tolerance<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. A servant wrongly suspected may throw up his job, a
son in the same case may leave his father’s roof, and a friend may
put an end to the friendship. The wife, if she suspects her husband, 
will  keep  quiet<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T13</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

not seek divorce in a law-court. Law has no remedy for <i>her</i>.

I have still to relate some of my failings during this meat-eating
period and also previous to it, which date from before my marriage or
soon after.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A relative and I became fond of smoking. Not that we saw any good in
smoking, or were enamoured of the smell of a cigarette. We simply
imagined a sort of pleasure in emitting clouds of smoke from our
mouths. My uncle had the habit, and when we saw him smoking, we
thought we should copy his example. But we had no money. So we began
pilfering stumps of cigarettes thrown away by my uncle.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The stumps, however, were not always available, and could not emit
much smoke either. So we began to steal coppers from the servant’s
pocket-money in order to purchase Indian cigarettes. But the question
was where to keep them. We could not of course smoke in the presence
of elders. We managed somehow for a few weeks on these stolen
coppers. In the mean time we heard that the stalks of a certain
plant<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>were porous and could be smoked like cigarettes. We
got them and began this kind of smoking.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But we were far from being satisfied with such things as these. Our
want of independence began to smart. It was unbearable that we should
be unable to do anything without the elder’s permission. At last,
in sheer disgust, we decided to commit suicide !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But how were we to do it? From where were we to get the poison? We
heard that dhatura<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>seeds were an effective poison. Off we went to the
jungle in search of these seeds, and got them. Evening was thought to
be the auspicious hour. We went to Kedarji Mandir, put ghee in the
temple-lamp, had the <i>darshan </i>and then looked for a lonely
corner. But our courage failed us. Supposing we were not</p>

instantly killed ? And what was the good of killing ourselves ? Why
not rather put up with the lack of independence? But we swallowed two
or three seeds nevertheless. We dared not take more. Both of us
fought shy of death, and decided to go to Ramji-Mandir to compose
ourselves, and to dismiss the thought of suicide.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I realized that it was not as easy to commit suicide as to
contemplate it. And since then, whenever I have heard of someone
threatening to commit suicide, it has had little or no effect on me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The thought of suicide ultimately resulted in both of us bidding
good-bye to the habit of smoking stumps of cigarettes and of stealing
the servant’s coppers for the purpose of smoking.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Ever since I have been grown up, I have never desired to smoke and
have always regarded the habit of smoking as barbarous, dirty and
harmful. I have never understood why there is such a rage for smoking
throughout the world. I cannot bear to travel in a compart- ment full
of people smoking. I become choked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But much more serious than this theft was the one I was guilty of a
little later. I pilfered the coppers when I was twelve or thirteen,
possibly less. The other theft was committed when I was fifteen. In
this case I stole a bit of gold out of my meat-eating brother’s
armlet. This brother had run into a debt of about twenty-five
rupees.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>He had on his arm an armlet of solid gold. It was not
difficult to clip a bit out of it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Well, it was done, and the debt cleared. But this became more than I
could bear. I resolved never to steal again. I also made up my mind
to confess it to my father. But I did not dare to speak. Not that I
was afraid of my father beating me. No. I do not recall his ever
having beaten any of us. I was afraid of the pain that I should cause
him.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3 </font></sup>But I
felt the risk should be taken; that there could not be a cleansing
without a clean confession.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I decided at last to write out the confession, to submit it to my
father, and ask his forgiveness. I wrote it on a slip of paper and
handed it to him myself. In this note not only did I confess my
guilt, but I asked adequate punishment for it, and closed with a
request to him not to punish himself for my offence. I also pledged
myself never to steal in future.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was trembling as I handed the confession to my father. He was then
suffering from a fistula and was confined to bed. His bed was a plain
wooden plank. I handed him the note and sat opposite the plank.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He read it through, and pearl-drops trickled down his cheeks, wetting
the paper. For a moment he closed his eyes in thought and</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
then tore up the note. He had sat up to read it. He again lay down. I
also cried. I could see my father’s agony. If I were a painter I
could draw a picture of the whole scene today. It is still so vivid
in my mind.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Those pearl-drops of love cleansed my heart, and washed my sin
away.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Only he who has experienced such love can know what it
is. As the hymn says :</p>

This sort of sublime forgiveness was not natural to my father. I had
thought that he would be angry, say hard things, and strike his
forehead. But he was so wonderfully peaceful, and I believe this was
due to my clean confession. A clean confession, combined with a
promise never to commit the sin again, when offered before one who
has the right to receive it, is the purest type of repentance. I know
that my confession made my father feel absolutely safe about me, and
increased his affection for me beyond measure<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup>.</p>

father, as we have seen, was bed-ridden, suffering from a fistula. My
mother, an old servant of the house, and I were his  principal
attendants. I had the duties of a nurse, which mainly consisted in
dressing the wound, giving my father his medicine, and compounding
drugs whenever they had to be made up at home. Every night I massaged
his legs and retired only when he asked me to do so or after he had
fallen asleep. I loved to do this service<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

was yet a student. And secondly, this carnal lust got the better of
what  I regarded as my duty to study, and of what was even a greater
duty, my devotion to my parents, Shravana having been my ideal since
childhood. Every night whilst my hands were busy massaging my
father’s legs, my mind was hovering about the bed-room—and that
too at a time when religion, medical science and common sense alike
forbade sexual intercourse. I was always glad to be relieved from my
duty, and went straight to the bed-room after doing obeisance to my
father.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At the same time my father was getting worse every day. Ayur- vedic
physicians had tried all their ointments, hakims their plasters, and
local quacks their nostrums. An English surgeon had also used his
skill. As the last and only resort he had recommended a surgical
operation. But the family physician came in the way. He disapproved
of an operation being performed at such an advanced age. The
physician was competent and well known, and his advice prevailed. The
operation was abandoned, and various medicines purchased for the
purpose were of no account. I have an impression that, if the phys-
ician had allowed the operation, the wound would have been easily
healed. The operation also was to have been performed by a surgeon
who was then well known in Bombay. But God had willed otherwise.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>When death is imminent, who can think of the right
remedy? My father returned from Bombay with all the paraphernalia of
the ope- ration, which were now useless. He despaired of living any
longer. He was getting weaker and weaker, until at last he had to be
asked to per- form the necessary functions in bed. But up to the last
he refused to do anything of the kind, always insisting on going
through the strain of leaving his bed. The Vaishnavite rules about
external cleanliness are so inexorable.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Such cleanliness is quite essential no doubt, but Western medical
science has taught us that all the functions, including a bath, can
be done in bed with the strictest regard to cleanliness, and without
the slightest discomfort to the patient, the bed always remaining
spotlessly clean. I should regard such cleanliness as quite
consistent with Vais- hnavism. But my father’s insistence on
leaving the bed only struck me with wonder then, and I had nothing
but admiration for it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The dreadful night came. My uncle was then in Rajkot. I have a faint
recollection that he came to Rajkot having had news that my father
was getting worse. The brothers were deeply attached to each other.
My uncle would sit near my father’s bed the whole day, and would
insist on sleeping by his bedside after sending us all to sleep. No
one had dreamt that this was to be the fateful night. The danger of
course was there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
It was 10.30 or 11 p.m. I was giving the massage. My uncle offered to
relieve me. I was glad and went straight to the bed-room. My wife,
poor thing, was fast asleep. But how could she sleep when I was
there? I woke her up. In five or six minutes, however, the servant<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4
</font></sup>knocked at the door. I started with alarm. ‘Get up,’
he said, ‘Father is very ill.’ I knew of course that he was very
ill, and so I guessed what ‘very ill’ meant at that moment. I
sprang out of bed.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 95%">
So all was over ! I had but to wring my hands.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I felt deeply ashamed and miserable. I ran to my
father’s room. I saw that, if animal passion had not blinded me, I
should have been spared the torture of separation from my father
during his last moments. I should have been massaging him,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and he would have died in   my arms.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>But now it was my uncle who had had this privilege.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>He was so deeply devoted to his elder brother that he
had earned the honour of doing him the last services ! My father had
forebodings of the coming event. He had made a sign for pen and
paper, and written : ‘Prepare for the last rites.’ He had then
snapped the amulet of his arm and also his gold necklace of  <i>tulasi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>1
   </i></font></sup>beads and flung them aside. A moment after this
he was no more.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The shame, to which I have referred in a foregoing chapter, was this
shame of my carnal desire even at the critical hour of my father’s
death, which demanded wakeful service.<font size="1">T9 </font>It is a
a blot I have never been able to efface or forget, and I have always
thought that, although my devotion to my parents knew no bounds and I
would have given up anything for it, yet it was weighed and found
unpardonably wanting becuase my mind was at the same moment in the
grip of lust.  I have therefore always regarded myself as a lustful,
though a faithful, husband. It took me long to get free from the
shackles of lust, and I had to pass through many ordeals before I
could overcome it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Before I close this chapter of my double shame, I may mention that
the poor mite that was born to my wife scarcely breathed for more
than three or four days. Nothing else could be expected. Let all
those who are married<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Being born in the Vaishnava faith, I had often to go to the <i>Haveli</i>.
But it never appealed to me. I did not like its glitter and pomp.
Also I heard rumours of immorality being practised there, and lost
all interest in it. Hence I could gain nothing from the <i>Haveli</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But what I failed to get there I obtained from my nurse, an old
servant of the family, whose affection for me I still recall. I have
said before that there was in me a fear of ghosts and spirits.
Rambha, for that was her name, suggested, as a remedy for this fear,
the repetition of Ramanama<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>. I had more faith in her than in her remedy, and so at
a tender age I began repeating Ramanama to cure my fear of ghosts and
spirits. This was of course short-lived, but the good seed sown in
childhood was not sown in vain. I think it is due to the seed sown by
that good woman Rambha that today Ramanama is an infallible remedy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>for me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Just about this time, a cousin of mine who was a devotee of the
<i>Ramayana </i>arranged for my second brother and me to learn <i>Rama</i><i>
</i><i>Raksha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3 </font></sup>.
We got it by heart, and made it a rule to recite it every mor- ning
after the bath. The practice was kept up as long as we were in
Porbandar. As soon as we reached<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Rajkot, it was forgotten. For I had not much belief in
it. I recited it partly because of my<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>pride in being able to recite <i>Rama </i><i>Raksha
</i>with correct pronunciation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
What, however, left a deep impression on me was the reading of the
<i>Ramayana </i>before my father. During part of his illness my
father was in Porbandar. There every evening he used to listen to the
<i>Ramayana</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The reader was a great devotee of Rama— Ladha Mah-
araj of Bileshwar. It was said of him that he cured himself of his

He had a melodious voice. He would sing the <i>dohas </i>(couplets)
and <i>chopais </i>(quatrains), and explain them, losing himself in
the discourse and carrying his listeners along with him. I must have
been thirteen at that time, but I quite remember being enraptured by
his reading. That laid the foundation of my deep devotion to the
<i>Ramayana</i>. Today I regard the <i>Ramayana </i>of Tul- asidas as
the greatest book in all devotional literature.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A few months after this we came to Rajkot. There was no <i>Ramayana
</i>reading there. The <i>Bhagavata</i>, however, used to be read on
every  <i>Ekadashi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  
</font></sup>day. Sometimes I attended the reading, but the reciter
was uninspiring. Today I see that the <i>Bhagavata </i>is a book
which can<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>evoke religious fervour. I have read it in Gujarati
with intense interest. But when I heard portions of the original read
by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya during my twenty-one days’ fast<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>, I wished I had heard it in my childhood from such a
devotee as he is, so that I could have formed a liking for it at an
early age. Impressions<font size="1">T9 </font>formed at that age
strike roots deep down into one’s nature, and it is my perpetual
regret that I was not fortunate enough to hear more good books of
this kind read during that period.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In Rajkot, however, I got an early grounding in toleration for all
branches of Hinduism and sister religions. For my father and mother
would visit the <i>Haveli </i>as also Shiva’s and Rama’s temples,
and would take or send us youngsters there. Jain monks also would pay
frequent visits to my father, and would even go out of their way to
accept food from  us—non-Jains.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10
     </font></sup>They  would  have  talks  with  my   father   on
subjects religious and mundane.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He had, besides, Mussalman and Parsi friends, who would talk to him
about their own faiths, and he would listen to them always with
respect, and often with interest. Being his nurse, I often had a
chance to be present at these talks. These many things combined to
inculcate in me a toleration for all faiths.</p>

Only Christianity was at the time an exception. I developed a sort of

Christianity. It was the talk of the town that, when he was baptized,
he had to eat beef and drink liquor, that he also had to change  his 
clothes, and that thenceforth he began to go about in European
costume including a hat. These things got on my nerves. Surely,
thought I, a religion that compelled one to eat beef, drink liquor,
and change one’s own clothes did not deserve the name. I also heard
that the new convert had already begun abusing the religion of his
ancestors, their customs and their country. All these things created
in me a dislike for Christianity.</p>

But the fact that I had learnt to be tolerant to other religions did
not mean that I had any living faith in God. I happened, about this
time, to come  across  <i>Manusmrit</i><i>i</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>1
   </i></font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>
</i></font></sup>which  was  amongst  my  father’s collection. The
story of the creation and similar things in it did not impress me
very much, but on the contrary  made  me  incline somewhat towards
atheism.</p>

There was a cousin of mine, still alive, for whose intellect I had
great regard. To him I turned with my doubts. But he could not
resolve them. He sent me away with this answer : ‘When you grow up,
you will be able to solve these doubts yourself. These questions
ought not to be raised at your age.’ I was silenced, but was not
comforted. Chapters about diet and the like in <i>Manusmriti </i>seemed
to me to run contrary to daily practice. To my doubts as to this
also, I got the same answer. ‘With intellect more developed and
with more reading I shall understand it better,’ I said to myself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Manusmrit<i>i </i>at any rate did not then teach me ahimsa. I have
told the story of my meat-eating. <i>Manusmriti </i>seemed to support
it. I also felt that it was quite moral to kill serpents, bugs and
the like. I remember to have killed at that age bugs and such other
insects, regarding it as a duty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But one thing took keep root in me—the conviction that  morality is
the basis of things, and that truth is the substance of all morality.
Truth became my sole objective. It began to grow in magnitude every
day, and my definition of it also has been ever widening.</p>

A Gujarati didactic stanza likewise gripped my mind and heart. Its
precept—return good for evil—became my guiding principle. It

I passed the matriculation examination in 1887. It then used to be
held at two centres, Ahmedabad and Bombay. The general poverty of the
country naturally led Kathiawad students to prefer the nearer and the
cheaper centre. The poverty of my family likewise dictated to me the
same choice. This was my first journey from Rajkot to Ahmedabad and
that too without a companion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My elders wanted me to pursue my studies at college after the
matriculation. There was a college in Bhavnagar as well as in Bombay,
and as the former was cheaper, I decided to go there and join the
Samaldas College. I went, but found myself entirely at sea. Every-
thing was difficult. I could not follow, let alone taking interest
in, the professors’ lectures. It was no fault of theirs. The
professors in that College were regarded as first-rate. But I was so
raw. At the end of the first term, I returned home.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We had in Mavji Dave<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>,
who was a shrewd and learned Brah- min, an old friend and adviser of
the family. He had kept up his connection with the family even after
my father’s death. He happened to visit us during my vacation. In
conversation with my mother and elder brother, he inquired about my
studies.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Learning that I was at Samaldas College, he said: ‘The times are
changed. And none of you can expect to succeed to your father’s
gadi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3   </font></sup>without
having had a proper education. Now as this boy is still pursuing his
studies, you should all look to him to keep the gadi. It will take
him four or five years to get his B.A. degree, which will at best
qualify him for a sixty rupees’ post, not for a Diwanship. If like
my son he went in for law<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>,
it would take him still longer, by which time there would be a host
of lawyers, aspiring for a Diwan’s post. I would far rather that
you sent him to England. My son Kevalram says</p>

it is very easy to become a barrister. In three years’ time he will
return. Also expenses will not exceed four to five thousand rupees.
Think of that barrister who has just come back from England. How
stylishly he lives! He could get the Diwanship for the asking. I
would strongly advise you to send Mohandas to England this very year.
Kevalram has numerous friends in England. He will give notes of

Joshiji—that is how we used to call old Mavji Dave—turned to me
with complete assurance, and asked: ‘Would you not rather go to
England than study here?’ Nothing could have been more welcome to
me. I was fighting shy of my difficult studies. So I jumped at the
proposal and said that the sooner I was sent the better. It was no
easy business to pass examinations quickly. Could I not be sent to
qualify for the medical profession?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My brother interrupted me: ‘Father never liked it. He had you in
mind when he said that we Vaishnavas should have nothing to do with
dissection of dead bodies. Father intended you for the bar.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Joshiji chimed in: ‘I am not opposed to the medical profession as
was Gandhiji. Our Shastras are not against it. But a medical degree
will not make a Diwan of you, and I want you to be Diwan, or if
possible something better. Only in that way could you take under your
protecting care your large family. The times are fast changing and
getting harder every day. It is the wisest thing therefore  to 
become a barrister.’ Turning to my mother he said: ‘Now, I must
leave. Pray ponder over what I have said. When I come here next I
shall expect to hear of preparations for England. Be sure to let me
know if I can assist in any way.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
Joshiji went away, and I began building castles in the air.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My elder brother was greatly exercised in his mind. How was he to
find the wherewithal to send me? And was it proper to trust a young
man like me to go abroad alone?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My mother was sorely perplexed. She did not like the idea of parting
with me. This is how she tried to put me off: ‘Uncle,’ she said,
is now the eldest member of the family. He should first be consulted.
If he consents we will consider the matter.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My brother had another idea. He said to me: ‘We have a certain
claim on the Porbandar State. Mr. Lely is the Administrator. He
thinks highly of our family and uncle is in his good books. It is
just possible that he might recommend you for some State help for
your education in England.’</p>

I liked all this and got ready to start off for Porbandar. There</p>

was no railway in those days. It was a five days’ bullock-cart
journey.  I have already said that I was a coward. But at that moment
my cowar- dice vanished before the desire to go to England, which
com-pletely possessed me. I hired a bullock-cart as far as Dhoraji,
and from Dhoraji I took a camel in order to get to Porbandar a day
quicker. This was my first camel-ride.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I arrived at last, did obeisance to my uncle, and told him ever-
ything. He thought it over and said: ‘I am not sure whether it is
possible for one to stay in England without prejudice to one’s own
religion. From all I have heard, I have my doubts. When I meet these
big barristers, I see no difference between their life and that of
Euro- peans. They know no scruples regarding food. Cigars are never
out of their mouths. They dress as shamelessly as Englishmen. All
that would not be in keeping with our family tradition. I am shortly
going on a pilgrimage and have not many years to live. At the
threshold of death, how dare I give you permission to go to England,
to cross the seas? But I will not stand in your way. It is your
mother’s permission which really matters. If she permits you, then
godspeed! Tell her I will not interfere. You will go with my
blessings.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I could expect nothing more from you,’ said I. ‘I shall now
try to win mother over. But would you not recommend me to Mr. Lely?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘How can I do that ?’ said he. ‘But he is a good man. You ask
for an appointment telling him how you are connected. He will
certainly give you one and may even help you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I cannot say why my uncle did not give me a note of recom- mendation.
I have a faint idea that he hesitated to co-operate directly in my
going to England, which was in his opinion an irreligious act.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I wrote to Mr. Lely, who asked me to see him at his residence. He saw
me as he was ascending the staircase; and saying curtly, ‘Pass your
B.A. first and then see me. No help can be given you now’, he
hurried upstairs. I had made elaborate preparations to meet him. I
had carefully learnt up a few sentences and had bowed low and saluted
him with both hands. But all to no purpose!</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I thought of my wife’s ornaments. I thought of my elder brother, in
whom I had the utmost faith. He was generous to a fault, and he loved
me as his son.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I returned to Rajkot from Porbandar and reported all that had
happened. I consulted Joshiji, who of course advised even incurring a
debt if necessary. I suggested the disposal of my wife’s ornaments,
which could fetch about two to three thousand rupees. My brother
promised to find the money somehow.</p>

minute inquiries. Someone had told her that young men got lost in
England. Someone else had said that they took to meat; and yet
another that they could not live there without liquor. ‘How about
all this?’ she asked me. I said: ‘Will you not trust me? I shall
not lie to you. I swear that I shall not touch any of those things.
If there were any such danger, would Joshiji let me go?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I can trust you,’ she said. ‘But how can I trust you in a

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Becharji Swami was originally a Modh Bania, but had now become a Jain
monk. He too was a family adviser like Joshiji. He came to my help,
and said: ‘I shall get the boy solemnly to take the three vows, and
then he can be allowed to go.’ He administered the oath and I vowed
not to touch wine, woman and meat. This done, my mother gave her
permission.</p>

The high school had a send-off in my honour. It was an uncommon thing
for a young man of Rajkot to go to England. I had written out a few
words of thanks. But I could scarcely stammer them out. I remember

them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

With my mother’s permission and blessings, I set off exultantly for
Bombay, leaving my wife with a baby of a few months. But on arrival
there friends told my brother that the Indian Ocean was rough in June
and July, and as this was my first voyage, I should not be allowed to
sail until November. Someone also reported that a steamer had just
been sunk in a gale. This made my brother uneasy, and he refused to
take the risk of allowing me to sail immediately. Leaving me with a
friend in Bombay, he returned to Rajkot to resume his duty. He put
the money for my travelling expenses in the keeping of a
brother-in-law, and left word with some friends to give me whatever
help I might need.</p>

abroad. No Modh Bania had been to England up to now, and if I dared
to do so, I ought to be brought to book! A general meeting of the
caste was called and I was summoned to appear before it. I went. How
I suddenly managed to muster up courage I do not know. Not- hing
daunted, and without the slightest hesitation, I came before the
meeting. The Sheth—the headman of the community—who was distantly
related to me and had been on very good terms with my father, thus
accosted me:</p>

‘In the opinion of the caste, your proposal to go to England is not

it is not possible to live there without compromising our religion.
One is obliged to eat and drink with Europeans!’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

religion to go to England. I intend going there<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

am sure the vow will keep me safe.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But we tell you,’ rejoined the Sheth, ‘that it is <i>not

This incensed the Sheth. He swore at me. I sat unmoved. So the Sheth
pronounced his order: ‘This boy shall be treated as an outcaste

shall be punishable with a fine of one rupee four annas.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
The order had no effect on me, and I took my leave of the Sheth. But
I wondered how my brother would take it. Fortunately he remained firm

order notwithstanding.</p>

The incident, however, made me more anxious than ever to sail. What
would happen if they succeeded in bringing pressure to bear on my
brother? Supposing something unforeseen happened? As I was thus
worrying over my predicament, I heard that a Junagadh vakil was going
to England, for being called to the bar, by a boat sailing on the 4th
of September. I met the friends to whose care my brother had
commended me. They also agreed that I should not let go the opp-</p>

ortunity of going in such company. There was no time to be lost. I
wired to my brother for permission, which he granted. I asked my
brother-in-law to give me the money. But he referred to the order of
the Sheth and said that he could not afford to lose caste. I then
sought  a friend of the family and requested him to accommodate me to
the extent of my passage and sundries, and to recover the loan from
my brother. The friend was not only good enough to accede to  my
request, but he cheered me up as well. I was so thankful. With part
of the money I at once purchased the passage. Then I had to equip
myself for the voyage. There was another friend who had experience in
the matter. He got clothes and other things ready. Some of the
clothes I liked and some I did not like at all. The necktie, which I
delighted in wearing later, I then abhorred. The short jacket I
looked upon as immodest. But this dislike was nothing before the
desire to go to England, which was uppermost in me. Of provisions
also I had enough and to spare for the voyage. A berth was reserved
for me by my friends in the same cabin as that of Sjt. Tryambakrai
Mazmudar, the Junagadh vakil. They also commended me to him. He was
an experienced man of mature age and knew the world. I was yet a
stripling of eighteen without any experience of the world. Sjt.
Mazmudar told my friends not to worry about me.</p>

I did not feel at all sea-sick. But as the days passed, I became
fidgety. I felt shy even in speaking to the steward. I was quite
unaccustomed to talking English, and except for Sjt. Mazmudar all the

English. I could not speak to them. For I could rarely follow their
remarks when they came up to speak to me, and even when I understood
I could not reply. I had to frame every sentence in my mind, before I
could bring it out. I was innocent of the use of knives and forks and
had not the boldness to inquire what dishes on the menu were free of
meat. I therefore never took meals at table but always had them in my
cabin, and they consisted principally of sweets and fruits which  I 
had  brought with me. Sjt. Mazmudar had no difficulty, and he mixed
with everybody. He would move about freely on deck, while I hid
myself in the cabin the whole day, only venturing up on deck when
there were but few people. Sjt. Mazmudar kept pleading with me to
associate with the passengers and to talk with them freely. He told
me that lawyers should have a long tongue, and related to me his

An English passenger, taking kindly to me, drew me into conversation.
He was older than I.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>He asked me what I ate, what I was, where I was going,
why I was shy, and so on. He also advised me to come to table. He
laughed at my insistence on abjuring meat, and said in a friendly way
when we were in the Red Sea: ‘It is all very well so far but you
will have to revise your decision in the Bay of Biscay. And it is so
cold in England that one cannot possibly live  there without meat.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But I have heard that people <i>can </i>live there without  eating
meat,’ I said.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Rest assured it is a fib,’ said he. ‘No one, to my knowledge,
lives there without being a meat-eater. Don’t you see that I am not
asking you to take liquor, though I do so? But I do think you should
eat meat, for you cannot live without it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I thank you for your kind advice, but I have solemnly promised to
my mother not to touch meat, and therefore I cannot think of taking
it. If it be found impossible to get on without it, I will far rather
go back to India than eat meat in order to remain there.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We entered the Bay of Biscay, but I did not begin to feel the need
either of meat or liquor. I had been advised to collect certificates
of my having abstained from meat, and I asked the English friend to
give me one. He gladly gave it and I treasured it for some time. But
when I saw later that one could get such a certificate in spite of
being a meat-eater, it lost all its charm for me. If my word was not
to be trusted, where was the use of possessing a certificate in the
matter ?</p>

However, we reached Southampton,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>as far as I remember, on a Saturday. On the boat I had
worn a black suit, the white flannel one, which my friends had got
me, having been kept especially for wearing when I landed. I had
thought that white clothes would suit me better when I stepped
ashore, and therefore I did so in white flannels. Those were the last
days of September, and I found I was the only person wearing such
clothes. I left in charge of an agent of Grindlay and Co. all my kit,
including the keys, seeing that many others had done the same and I
must follow suit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had four notes of introduction : to Dr. P. J. Mehta, to Sjt.
Dalpatram Shukla, to Prince Ranjitsinhji and to Dadabhai Naoroji.
Someone on board had advised us to put up at the Victoria Hotel in
London. Sjt. Mazmudar and I accordingly went there. The shame of</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
being the only person in white clothes was already too much for me.
And when at the Hotel I was told that I should not get my things from
Grindlay’s the next day, it being a Sunday, I was exasperated.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Mehta, to whom I had wired from Southampton,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>called at about eight o’clock the same evening. He
gave me a hearty greeting. He smiled at my being in flannels. As we
were talking, I casually picked up his top-hat, and trying to see how
smooth it was, passed my hand over it the wrong way and disturbed the
fur. Dr. Mehta looked somewhat angrily<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>at   what  I  was  doing  and  stopped  me.  But  the
mischief had been done. The incident was a warning for the future.
This was my first lesson in European etiquette, into the details of
which Dr. Mehta humorously initiated me. ‘Do not touch other
people’s things,’ he said. ‘Do not ask questions as we usually
do in India on first acquaintance; do not talk loudly; never address
people as ‘sir’ whilst speaking to them as we do in India, only
servants and subordinates address their masters that way.’ And so
on and so forth. He also told me that it was very expensive to live
in a hotel and recommended that I should live with a private family.
We deferred consideration of the matter until Monday.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Sjt. Mazmudar and I found the hotel to be a trying affair. It was
also very expensive. There was, however, a Sindhi fellow- passenger
from Malta who had become friends with Sjt. Mazmudar, and as he was
not a stranger to London, he offered to find rooms for us. We agreed,
and on Monday, as soon as we got our baggage, we paid up our bills
and went to the rooms rented for us by the Sindhi friend. I remember
my hotel bill came to £3, an amount which shocked me. And I had
practically starved in spite of this heavy bill ! For I could relish
nothing. When I did not like one thing, I asked for another, but had
to pay for both just the same. The fact is that all this while I had
depended on the provisions which I had brought  with me from Bombay.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I was very uneasy even in the new rooms. I would continually think of
my home and country. My mother’s love always haunted me. At night
the tears would stream down my cheeks and home mem- ories of all
sorts made sleep out of the question. It was impossible to share my
misery with anyone. And even if I could have done so, where was the
use ? I knew of nothing that would soothe me. Everything was
strange—the people, their ways, and even their dwel- lings. I was a
complete novice in the matters of English etiquette and continually
had to be on my guard. There was the additional inc- onvenience of
the vegetarian vow. Even the dishes that I could eat were tasteless
and insipid. I thus found myself between Scylla and Charybdis.
England I could not bear, but to return to India was not to</p>

Dr. Mehta went on Monday to the Victoria Hotel expecting to find me
there. He discovered that we had left,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>got our new address, and met me at our rooms. Through
sheer folly I had managed to get ringworm on the boat. For washing
and bathing we used to have sea- water, in which soap is not soluble.
I, however, used soap, taking its use to be a sign of civilization,
with the result that instead of cleaning the skin it made it greasy.
This gave me ringworm. I showed it to Dr. Mehta, who told me to apply
acetic acid. I remember how the burning acid made me cry. Dr. Mehta
inspected my room and its appoint- ments and shook his head in
disapproval. ‘This place won’t do,’ he said. ‘We come to
England not so much for the purpose of studies as for gaining
experience of English life and customs. And for this you need to live
with a family. But before you do so, I think you had better serve a
period of apprenticeship with—. I will take you there.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I gratefully accepted the suggestion and removed to the friend’s
rooms. He was all kindness and attention. He treated me as his own
brother, initiated me into English ways and manners, and accustomed
me to talking the language. My food, however, became a serious
question. I could not relish boiled vegetables cooked without salt or
condiments. The landlady was at a loss to know what to prepare for
me. We had oatmeal porridge for breakfast, which was fairly filling,
but I always starved at lunch and dinner. The friend continually
reasoned with me to eat meat, but I always pleaded my vow and then
remained silent.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Both
for luncheon and dinner we had spinach and bread and jam too. I was a
good eater and had a capacious stomach; but I was ashamed to ask for
more than two or three slices of bread, as it did not seem correct to
do so. Added to this, there was no milk either for lunch or dinner.
The friend once got disgusted with this state of things, and said:
‘Had you been my own brother, I would have sent you packing. What
is the value of a vow made before an illiterate mother, and in
ignorance of conditions here ? It is no vow at all. It would not be
regarded as a vow in law. It is pure superstition to stick to such a
promise. And I tell you this persistence will not help you to gain
anything here. You confess to having eaten and relished meat. You
took it where it was absolutely unnecessary, and will not where it is
quite essential. What a pity!’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.04cm">
But I was adamant.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Day in and day out the friend would argue, but I had an eternal
negative to face him with. The more he argued, the more uncompro-</p>

mising I became. Daily I would pray for God’s protection and get
it. Not that I had any idea of God. It was faith that was at
work—faith of which the seed had been sown by the good nurse
Rambha.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One day the friend began to read to me Bentham’s <i>Theory </i><i>of
</i><i>Utility</i>. I was at my wit’s end. The language was too
difficult for me to understand. He began to expound it. I said: ‘Pray
ex- cuse me. These abstruse things are beyond me. I admit it is
necessary to eat meat. But  I cannot break my vow. I cannot argue
about it. I am sure I cannot meet you in argument. But please give me
up as foolish or obstinate. I appreciate your love for me and I know
you to be my well-wisher. I also know that you are telling me again
and again about this because you feel for me. But I am helpless. A
vow is a vow. It cannot be broken.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The friend looked at me in surprise. He closed the book and said:
‘All right. I will not argue any more.’ I was glad. He never
discussed the subject again. But he did not cease to worry about me.
He smoked and drank, but he never asked me to do so. In fact he asked
me to remain away from both. His one anxiety was lest I should become
very weak without meat, and thus be unable to feel at home in
England.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
That is how I served my apprenticeship for a month.  The friend’s
house was in Richmond, and it was not possible to go to London more
than once or twice a week. Dr. Mehta and Sjt. Dal- patram Shukla
therefore decided that I should be put with  some family. Sjt. Shukla
hit upon an Anglo-Indian’s house in West Kensin- gton and placed me
there. The landlady was a widow. I told her about my vow. The old
lady promised to look after me properly, and I took up my residence
in her house. Here too I practically had to starve. I had sent for
sweets and other eatables from home, but nothing had yet come.
Everything was insipid. Every day the old lady asked me whether I
liked the food, but what could she do? I was still as shy as ever and
dared not ask for more than was put before me. She had two daughters.
They insisted on serving me with an extra slice or two of bread. But
little did they know that nothing less than a loaf would have filled
me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But I had found my feet<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>now. I had not yet started upon my regular studies. I
had just begun reading newspapers, thanks to Sjt. Shukla. In India I
had never read a newspaper. But here I succeeded in cultivating a
liking for them by regular reading. I always glanced over <i>The
Daily News, The Daily Telegraph, </i>and <i>The Pall Mall Gazette</i>.
This took me hardly an hour. I therefore began to wander about. I
launched out in search of a vegetarian restaurant. The landlady had</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
told me that there were such places in the city. I would trot ten or
twelve miles each day, go into a cheap restaurant and eat my fill of
bread, but would never be satisfied. During these wanderings I once
hit on a vegetarian restaurant in Farringdon Street. The sight of it
filled me with the same joy that a child feels on getting a thing
after its own heart. Before I entered I noticed books for sale
exhibited under a glass window near the door. I saw among them Salt’s
<i>Plea </i><i>for Vegetarianism</i>. This I purchased for a shilling
and went straight to the dining-room. This was my first hearty meal
since my arrival in England. God had come to my aid.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I read Salt’s book from cover<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to cover and was very   much impressed by it. From the
date of reading this book, I may claim to have become a vegetarian by
choice. I blessed the day on which I had taken the vow before my
mother. I had all along<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>abstained  from meat in the interests of truth and<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>of  the  vow  I  had  taken,  but  had wished at the
same time that every Indian should be a meat-eater, and had looked
forward to being one myself freely and openly some day, and to
enlisting others in the cause. The choice was now made in favour of
vegetarianism, the spread of which henceforward became by mission.</p>

My faith in vegetarianism grew on me from day to day. Salt’s book
whetted my appetite for dietetic studies. I went in for all books
available on vegetarianism and read them. One of these, Howard
Williams’s <i>The Ethics of Diet</i>, was a ‘biographical history
of the liter- ature of humane dietetics from the earliest period to
the present day’. It tried to make out, that all philosophers and
prophets  from Pythagoras and Jesus down to those of the present age
were vegetarians. Dr. Anna Kingsford’s <i>The </i><i>Perfect </i><i>Way
</i><i>in </i><i>Diet </i>was also an attractive book. Dr. Allinson’s
writings on health and hygiene were likewise very helpful. He
advocated a curative system based on regulation of the dietary of
patients. Himself a vegetarian, he prescribed for his patients also a
strictly vegetarian diet. The result of reading all this literature
was that dietetic experiments came to take an important place in my
life. Health was the principal consideration of these experiments to
begin with. But later on religion became the supreme motive.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Meanwhile my friend had not ceased to worry about me. His love for me
led him to think that, if I persisted in my objections to
meat-eating, I should not only develop a weak constitution, but
should remain a duffer, because I should never feel at home in
English society. When he came to know that I had begun to interest
myself in</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
books on vegetarianism, he was afraid lest these studies should
muddle my head; that I should fritter my life away in experiments,
forgetting my own work, and become a crank. He therefore made one
last effort to reform me. He one day invited me to go to the theatre.
Before the play we were to dine together at the Holborn Restaurant,
to me a palatial place and the first big restaurant I had been to
since leaving the Victoria Hotel. The stay at that hotel had scarcely
been a helpful experience, for I had not lived there with my wits
about me. The friend had planned to take me to this restaurant
evidently imagining that modesty would forbid any questions.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>And
  it  was  a  very  big company of diners in the midst of which my
friend and I sat sharing a table between us. The first course was
soup. I wondered what it might be made of, but durst not ask the
friend about it. I therefore sum- moned the waiter. My friend saw the
movement and sternly asked across the table what was the matter. With
considerable hesitation I told him that I wanted to inquire if the
soup was a vegetable soup. ‘You are too clumsy for decent society,’
he passionately exclaimed. ‘If you cannot behave yourself, you had
better go. Feed in some other<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>restaurant
and await me outside.’ This delighted  me.  Out  I went. There was
a vegetarian restaurant close by, but it was closed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>So
I went without food that night. I accompanied my friend  to  the
theatre, but he never said a word about the scene I had created. On
my part of course there was nothing to say.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
That was the last friendly tussle we had. It did not affect our
relations in the least. I could see and appreciate the love by which
all my friend’s efforts were actuated, and my respect for him was

But I decided that I should put him at ease, that I should assure him
that I would be clumsy no more, but try to become polished and make
up for my vegetarianism by cultivating other accomplishments which
fitted one for polite society. And for this purpose I undertook the
all too impossible task of becoming an English gentleman.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The clothes<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>after the Bombay cut that I was wearing were, I
thought, unsuitable for English society, and I got new ones at the
Army and Navy Stores. I also went in for a chimney-pot hat costing
nineteen shillings—an excessive price in those days. Not content
with this, I wasted ten pounds on an evening suit made in Bond
Street, the centre of fashionable life in London<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup>;
and got my good and noble- hearted brother to send me a double
watch-chain of gold. It was not correct to wear a ready-made tie and
I learnt the art of tying one for myself. While in India, the mirror
had been a luxury permitted on the days when the family barber gave
me a shave. Here I wasted ten minutes every day before a huge mirror,
watching myself arranging</p>

my tie and parting my hair in the correct fashion. My hair was by no
means soft, and every day it meant a regular struggle with the
brush<font size="1">T9</font><font size="1"> </font>to keep it in
position. Each time the hat was put on and off, the hand would
automatically move towards the head to adjust the hair, not to
mention the other civilized habit of the hand every now and then
operating for the same purpose when sitting in polished society.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As if all this were not enough to make me look the thing, I directed
my attention to other details that were supposed to go towards the
making of an English gentleman.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I was told it was necessary for me to take lessons in
dancing, French and elocution.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>French was not only the language of neighbouring
France, but it was the lingua franca of the Continent over which I
had a desire to travel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I decided to take dancing lessons at a class and paid
down £3 as fees for a term.  I must have taken about six lessons in
three weeks. But it was beyond me to achieve anything like rhythmic
motion. I could not follow the piano and hence found it impossible to
keep time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T13</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>What then was I do? The recluse in the fable kept a
cat to keep off the rats, and then a cow to feed the cat with milk,
and a man to keep the cow and so on. My ambitions also grew like the
family of the recluse. I thought I should learn to play the violin in
order to cultivate an ear for Western music. So I invested £3 in a
violin<font size="1">14 </font>and something more in fees. I sought a
third teacher to give me lessons in elocution and paid him a
preliminary fee of a guinea. He recommended Bell’s <i>Standard
Elocutionist </i>as the text-book, which I purchased. And I began
with a speech of Pitt’s.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.04cm">
But Mr. Bell rang the bell of alarm in my ear and I awoke.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I had not to spend a lifetime in England, I said to myself. What then
was the use of learning elocution? And how could dancing make a
gentleman of me? The violin I could learn even in India. I was a
student and ought to go on with my studies. I should qualify myself
to join the Inns of Court. If my character made a gentleman of me, so
much the better. Otherwise I should forgo the ambition.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
These and similar thoughts possessed me, and I expressed them in a
letter which I addressed to the elocution teacher, requesting him to
excuse me from further lessons. I had taken only two or three. I
wrote a similar letter to the dancing teacher, and went personally to
the violin teacher with a request to dispose of the violin for any
price it might fetch. She was rather friendly to me,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T15</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>so I told her how I had discovered that I was pursuing
a false idea. She encouraged me in the determination to make a
complete change.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

Let no one imagine that my experiments in dancing and the like marked
a stage of indulgence in my life. The reader will have noticed that
even then I had my wits about me. That period of infatuation was not
unrelieved by a certain amount of self-intro-spection on my part.  I
kept account of every farthing I spent, and my expenses were
carefully  calculated.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Every

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>would
  be entered, and the balance struck every evening before going to
bed. That habit has stayed with me ever since, and I know that as a
result, though I have had to handle public funds amounting to lakhs,
I have succeeded in exercising strict economy in their disbursement
and, instead of outstanding debts, have had invariably a surplus
balance in respect of all the movements I have led. Let every youth
take a leaf out of my book and make it a point to account for
everything that comes into and goes out of his pocket,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
As I kept strict watch over my way of living, I could see that it was
 necessary  to  economize.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
  therefore   decided   to   reduce   my expenses by half. My
accounts showed numerous items  spent  on fares. Again my living with
a family meant the payment of a regular weekly bill. It also included
the courtesy of occasionally taking members of the family out to
dinner, and likewise attending parties with them. All this involved
heavy items for conveyances, especially as, if the friend was a lady,
custom required that the man should pay all the expenses. Also dining
out meant extra cost, as no deduction could be made from the regular
weekly bill for meals not taken. It seemed to me that all these items
could be saved, as likewise the drain on my purse caused through a
false sense of propriety.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
So I decided to take rooms on my own account, instead of living any
longer in a   family,  and  also  to  remove  from  place  to 
place<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">t6 </font></sup>according
to the work I had to do, thus gaining experience at the same time.
The rooms were so selected as to enable me to reach the place of
business on foot in half an hour, and so save fares. Before this I
had always some kind of conveyance<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>whenever I went anywhere and had to find extra time
for walks. The new arrangement combined walks and economy, as it
meant a saving of fares and gave me walks of eight or ten miles a
day. It was mainly this habit of long walks that kept me practically
free from illness throughout my stay in England and gave</p>

me a fairly strong body.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus I rented a suite of rooms; one for a sitting-room and another
for a bedroom. This was the second stage. The third was yet to come.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These changes saved me half the expense. But how was I to utilize the
time? I knew that Bar examinations did not require much study, and I
therefore did not feel pressed for time. My weak English was a
perpetual worry to me. Mr. (afterwards Sir Frederic) Lely’s words,
‘Graduate first and then come to me,’ still rang in my ears. I
should, I thought, not only be called to the Bar, but have some
literary degree as well. I inquired about the Oxford and Cambridge
University courses, consulted a few friends, and found that, if I
elected to go to either of these places, that would mean greater
expense and a much longer stay in England than I was prepared for. A
friend suggested that, if I really wanted to have the satisfaction of
taking a difficult examination, I should pass the London
Matriculation. It meant a good deal of labour and much addition to my
stock of general knowledge, without any extra expense worth the name.
I welcomed the sugges- tion. But the syllabus frightened me. Latin
and a modern language were compulsory ! How was I to manage Latin ?
But  the  friend entered a strong plea for it: ‘Latin is very
valuable to lawyers. Know- ledge of Latin is very useful in
understanding law-books. And one paper in<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Roman
Law is entirely in Latin. Besides, a knowledge of Latin means greater
command over the English language.’ It went home and I decided to
learn Latin, no matter how difficult it might be. French I had
already begun, so I thought that should be the modern language. I
joined a private Matriculation class. Examinations were held every
six months and I had only five months at my disopsal. It was an
almost impossible task for me. But the aspirant after being an
English gentleman chose to convert himself<font size="1">T9 </font>into
a serious student. I framed my own time-table to the minute; but
neither my intelligence nor memory promised to enable me to tackle
Latin  and  French besides other subjects within the given period.
The result was that I was ploughed in Latin. I was sorry<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>but
 did  not  lose  heart.  I  had acquired a taste for Latin, also I
thought my French would be all the better for another trial and I
would select a new subject in the science group. Chemistry which was
my subject in science had no attraction for want of experiments,
whereas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>it ought to have been a deeply interesting study. It was
one of the compulsory subjects in India and so I had selected it for
the London Matriculation. This time, however,  I chose Heat and Light
instead of Chemistry. It was said to be easy and I found it to be so.</p>

simplify my life still further. I felt that my way of living did not
yet befit the modest means of my family. The thought of my struggling
brother, who nobly responded to my regular calls for monetary help,
deeply pained me. I saw that most of those who were spending from
eight to fifteen pounds monthly had the advantage of scholarships. I
had before me examples of much simpler living. I came across a fair
number of poor students living more humbly than I. One of them was
staying in the slums in a room at two shillings a week and living on
twopence worth of cocoa and bread per meal from Lockhart’s cheap
Cocoa Rooms. It was far from<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12
  </font></sup>me to think of emulating him, but I felt I could
surely have one room instead of two and cook some of my meals at
home. That would be a saving of<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T14
  </font></sup>four to five pounds each<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T15</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>month. I also came across books on simple living. I
gave up the suite of rooms and rented one instead, invested in a
stove, and began cooking my breakfast at home. The process scarcely
took me more than twenty minutes, for there was only oatmeal porridge
to cook and water to boil for cocoa. I had lunch out and for dinner
bread and cocoa at home. Thus I managed to live on a shilling and
three pence a day. This was also a period of intensive study. Plain
living saved me plenty of time and I passed my examination.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Let not the reader think that this living made my life by any means a
dreary affair. On the contrary the change harmonized my inward and
outward life. It was also more in keeping with the means of my
family. My life was certainly more truthful<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T16</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

EXPERIMENTS IN DIETETICS</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
As I searched myself deeper, the necessity for changes both internal
and external began to grow on me. As soon as, or  even before, I made
alterations in my expenses and my way of living, I began to make
changes in my diet. I saw that the writers on vegetaria- nism had
examined the question very minutely, attacking it in its religious,
scientific, practical and medical aspects. Ethically they had arrived
at the conclusion that man’s supremacy over the lower animals<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>meant
not that the former should prey upon the latter, but that the higher
should protect the lower, and that there should be mutual aid between
the two as between man and man. They had also brought out the truth
that man eats not for enjoyment but to live. And some of them
accordingly suggested and effected in their lives abstention   not  
only   from   fleshmeat   but   from   eggs   and   milk<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>.
Scientifically some had concluded that man’s physical structure
showed that he was not meant to be a cooking but a frugivorous
animal, that he could take only his mother’s milk and, as soon as
he</p>

had teeth, should begin to take solid foods. Medically they had
suggested the rejection of all spices and condiments. According to
the practical and economic argument they had demonstrated that a
vegetarian diet was the least expensive. All these considerations had
their effect on me, and I came across vegetarians of all these types
in vegetarian restaurants. There was a Vegetarian Society in England
with a weekly journal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>of its own. I subscribed to the weekly, joined the
Society and very shortly found  myself on the Executive Committee.
Here I came in contact with those who were regarded as pillars of
vegetarianism, and began my own experiments in dietetics.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I stopped taking the sweets and condiments I had got from home. The
mind having taken a different turn, the fondness for condiments wore
away, and I now relished the boiled spinach, which in Richmond tasted
insipid, cooked without condiments. Many such experiments taught me
that the real seat of taste was not the tongue but the mind.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The economic consideration was of course constantly before me. There
was in those days a body of opinion which regarded tea and coffee as
harmful and favoured cocoa. And as I was convinced that one should
eat only articles that sustained the body, I gave up tea and coffee
as a rule, and substituted cocoa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were two divisions in the restaurants I used to visit. One
division, which was patronized by fairly well-to-do people, provided
any number of courses from which one chose and paid for <i>a la
carte</i>, each dinner thus costing from one to two shillings. The
other division provided six-penny dinners of three courses with a
slice of bread. In my days of strict frugality I usually dined in the
second division.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were many minor experiments going on along with the main one;
as for example, giving up starchy foods at one time; living on bread
and fruit alone at another, and once living on cheese, milk and eggs.
This last experiment is worth noting. It lasted not even a
fortnight.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2    </font></sup>The
reformer who advocated starchless food had spoken highly of eggs and
held that eggs were not meat. It was apparent that there was no
injury done to living creatures in taking eggs. I was taken in by
this plea and took eggs in spite of my vow. But the lapse was
momentary. I had no business to put a new interpretation on the
vow.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

therefor me. I knew that her definition of meat included eggs. And as
soon as I saw the true import of the vow I gave up eggs and the
experiment alike.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There is a nice point underlying the argument, and  worth  noting. I
came across three definitions of meat in England. Accor- ding to the
first, meat denoted only the flesh of birds and beasts. Vegetarians
who accepted that definition abjured the flesh of birds and beasts,
but ate fish, not to mention eggs. According to the second
definition, meat meant flesh of all living creatures. So fish was
here out of the question, but eggs were allowed. The third definition
included under meat the flesh of all living beings, as well as all
their products, thus covering eggs and milk alike. If I accepted the
first definition, I could take not only eggs, but fish also. But I
was conv- inced that my mother’s definition was the definition
binding on me. If, therefore, I would observe the vow I had taken, I
must abjure eggs.  I therefore did so. This was a hardship inasmuch
as inquiry showed that even in vegetarian restaurants many courses
used to contain eggs. This meant that unless<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
knew what was what, I had to go through the awkward process of
ascertaining whether a particular course contained eggs or no, for
many puddings and cakes were not free from them. But though the
revelation of my duty caused this difficulty, it simplified my food.
The simplification in its turn brought me annoyance in that I had to
give up several dishes I had come to relish. These difficulties were
only passing, for the strict observance of the vow produced an inward
relish disinctly more healthy, delticate and permanent<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The real ordeal, however, was still to come, and that was in respect
of the other vow. But who dare harm whom God protects ?</p>

My experiments in England were conducted from the point of view of
economy and hygiene. The religious aspect of the question was not
considered until I went to South Africa where I undertook strenuous
experiments which will be narrated later. The seed, however, for all
of them was sown in England.</p>

A convert’s enthusiasm for<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T17
 </font></sup>his new religion is greater than that of a person who
is born in it. Vegetarianism was then a new cult in England, and
likewise for me, because, as we have seen, I had gone there a
convinced meat-eater, and was intellectually converted to
vegetarianism later.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T18</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Full of the neophyte’s zeal for vegetarianism. I
decided to start a vegetarian club in my locality, Bayswater. I
invited Sir Edwin Arnold, who lived there, to be Vice-President. Dr.
Oldfield who was Editor of <i>The Vegetarian </i>became President. I
myself became the Secretary. The club went well for a while, but came
to an end in the course of a few months. For I left the locality,
according to my custom of moving from place to place periodically.
But this brief and modest experience gave me some little training in
organizing and conducting institutions.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
I was elected to the Executive Committee of the Vegetarian Society,
and made it a point to attend every one of its meetings, but I always
felt tongue-tied. Dr. Oldfield once said to me, ‘You talk to me
quite all right, but why is it that you never open your lips at a
committee meeting ? You are a drone.’ I appreciated the banter. The
bees are ever busy, the drone is a thorough idler. And it was not a
little curious that whilst others expressed their opinions at these
meetings, I sat quite silent. Not that I never felt tempted to speak.
But I was at a loss to know how to express myself. All the rest of
the members appeared to me to be better informed than I. Then it
often happened that just when I had mustered up courage to speak, a
fresh subject would be started. This went on for a long time.</p>

Meantime a serious question came up for discussion. I thought</p>

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
felt it cowardice to register a silent vote. The discussion arose
somewhat in this wise. The President of the Society was Mr. Hills,
proprietor of the Thames Iron Works. He was a puritan. It may be said
that the existence of the Society depended practically   on   his   
financial   assistance.    Many   members   of  the</p>

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>was
also a member of the Committee. He was an advocate of the then new
birthcontrol movement, and preached its methods among the working
classes. Mr. Hills regarded these methods as cutting at the root of
morals. He thought that the Vegetarian Society had for its object not
only dietetic but also moral reform, and that a man of Dr. Allinson’s
anti-puritanic<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>views
should not be allowed to remain in the Society. A motion was
therefore brought for his removal. The question deeply interested me.
I considered Dr. Allinson’s views regarding artificial methods of
birth control as dangerous, and I believed that Mr. Hills was
entitled, as a puritan, to oppose him.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I

one of the objects of the Society.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Mr.

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>was
simply the promotion of vegetarianism and not of any system of

There were in the Committee others also who shared my view, but I
felt myself personally called upon to express my own. How to do it
was the question. I had not the courage to speak and I therefore
decided to set down<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>my thoughts in writing<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

document in my pocket. So far as I recollect, I did not find myself
equal even to reading it, and the President had it read by someone
else. Dr. Allinson lost the day. Thus in the very first battle of the
kind I found myself siding with the losing party. But  I  had comfort
in the thought that the cause was right. I have a faint recollection
that, after this incident, I resigned from the Committee This shyness
I retained throughout my stay in England. Even when I paid a social
call the presence of half a dozen or more people would strike me
dumb.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
I once went to Ventnor with Sjt. Mazmudar. We stayed there with a
vegetarian family. Mr. Howard, the author of <i>The Ethics of Diet</i>,
was also staying at the same watering-place. We met him, and he
invited us to speak at a meeting for the promotion of vegetarianism.
I had ascertained that it was not considered incorrect to read one’s
speech. I knew that many did so to express themselves coherently and
briefly. To speak extempore would have been out of the question for
me. I had therefore written down my speech. I stood up to read it,
but could</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
not. My vision became blurred and I trembled, though the speech
hardly covered a sheet of foolscap. Sjt. Mazmudar had to read it for
me. His own speech was of course excellent and was received with
applause. I was ashamed of myself and sad at heart for my incapacity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My last effort to make a public speech in England was on the eve of
my departure for home. But this time too I only succeeded in making
myself ridiculous.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
invited my vegetarian friends to dinner in the Holborn Restaurant
referred to in these chapters. ‘A vegetarian dinner could be had,’
I said to myself, ‘in vegetarian restaurants as a matter of course.
But why should it not be possible in a non-veg- etarian restaurant
too?’ And I arranged with the manager of the Holborn   Restaurant  
to   provide   a   strictly    vegetarian    meal.  The</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
vegetarians hailed the new experiment with delight . All dinners are
meant for enjoyment, but the West has developed the thing into an
art. They are celebrated with great <i>eclat</i>, music and speeches.
And the little dinner party that I gave was also not un-accompanied
by some such display. Speeches, therefore, there had to be. When my
turn for speaking came, I stood up to make a speech. I had with great
care thought out one which would consist of a very few sentences. But
I could not proceed beyond the first sentence. I had read of Addison
that he began his maiden speech in the House of Commons, repeating ‘I
conceive’ three times, and when he could proceed no further, a wag
stood up and said, ‘The gentleman conceived thrice but brought
forth nothing.’ I had thought of making a humorous speech taking
this anecdote as the text. I therefore began with it and stuck there.
My</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
memory entirely failed me and in attempting a humorous speech I made
myself ridiculous. ‘I thank you, gentlemen, for having kindly
responded to my invitation,’ I said abruptly, and sat down.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 90%">
It was only in South Africa that I got over this shyness, though I
never completely overcame it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T15</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>It was impossible for me to  speak <i>impromptu</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T16

making a speech whenever I could. Even today I do not</p>

think I could or would even be inclined to keep a meeting of friends
engaged in idle talk.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must say that, beyond occasionally exposing me to laughter, my
constitutional shyness has been no disadvantage whatever. In fact I
can see that, on the contrary, it has been all to my advantage. My
hesitancy in speech, which was once an annoyance, is now a pleasure.
Its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of
words. I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts.</p>

had to regret anything in my speech or writing. I have thus been
spared many a mishap and waste of time. Experience has taught me that
silence is part of the spiritual discipline of a votary of truth.
Proneness to exaggerate, to suppress or modify the truth, wittingly
or unwittingly, is a natural weakness of man, and silence is
necessary in order to surmount it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T19</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

man of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his speech; he will
measure every word. We find so many people impatient to talk. There
is no chairman of a meeting who is not pestered with notes for
permission to speak. And whenever the permission is given the speaker
generally exceeds the time-limit, asks for more time, and keeps on
talking without permission. All this talking can hardly be said to be
of any benefit to the world. It is so much waste of time. My shyness

There were comparatively few Indian students in England forty years
ago. It was a practice with them to affect the bachelor even though
they might be married. School or college students in England are all
bachelors, studies being regarded as incompatible with married life.
We had that tradition in the good old days, a student then being
invariably known as a  <i>brahmchari</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. But in these days we have child- marriages, a thing
practically unknown in England. Indian youths in England, therefore,
felt ashamed to confess that they were married. There was also
another reason for dissembling, namely that in the event of the fact
being known it would be impossible for the young man to go about or
flirt with the young girls of the family in which they  lived.  The 
flirting  was  more   or   less   innocent.   Parents even</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
encouraged it ; and that sort of association between young men and
young women may even be a necessity there, in view of the fact that
every young man has to choose his mate. If, however, Indian youths</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
on arrival in England indulge in these relations, quite natural to
English youths, the result is likely to be disastrous, as has often
been found. I saw that our youths had succumbed to the temptation and
chosen a life of untruth for the sake of companionships  which,
however innocent in the case of English youths, were for them
undesirable. I  too caught the contagion. I  did  not  hesitate   to

sprightly young lady of twenty-five darted down the hill like an
arrow. I was shamefacedly struggling to get down<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. She stood at the foot smiling and cheering me and
offering to come and drag me. How could I be so chicken-hearted ?
With the greatest difficulty, and crawling at intervals, I somehow
managed to scramble to the bottom. She loudly laughed ‘bravo’ and
shamed me all the more, as well she might.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
But I could not escape scatheless everywhere. For God wanted to rid
me of the canker of untruth. I once went to Brighton, another
watering-place like Ventnor. This was before the Ventnor visit. I met
there at a hotel an old widow of moderate means. This was my first
year in England. The courses on the <i>menu </i>were all described in
French, which I did not understand. I sat at the same table as the
old lady. She saw that I was a stranger and puzzled, and immediately
came to my aid. ‘You seem to be a stranger,’ she said, ‘and
look perplexed. Why have you not ordered anything ?’ I was spelling
through the <i>menu </i>and preparing to ascertain the ingredients of
the courses from the waiter, when the good lady thus intervened. I
thanked her, and explaining my difficulty told her that I was at a
loss to know which of the courses were vegetarian as I did not
understand French.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Let me help you,’ she said, “I shall explain the card to you
and show you what you may eat.’ I gratefully availed of her help.
This was the beginning of an acquaintance that ripened into frien-
dship and was kept up all through my stay in England and long after.
She gave me her London address and invited me to dine at her house
every Sunday. On special occasions also she would invite me, help me
to conquer my bashfulness and introduce me to young ladies and draw
me into conversation with them. Particularly marked out for these
conversations was a young lady who stayed with her, and often we
would be left entirely alone together.</p>

I found all this very trying at first. I could not start  a
conversation nor could I indulge in any jokes. But she put me in the
way. I began to learn; and in course of time looked forward to every
Sunday and came to like the conversations with the young friend.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The old lady went on spreading her net wider every day. She felt
interested in our meetings. Possibly she has her own plans about us.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I was in a quandary. ‘How I wished I had told the good lady that I
was married !’ I said to myself. ‘She would then have not thou-
ght of an engagement between us. It is, however, never too late to
mend. If I declare the truth, I might yet be saved more misery.’
With these thoughts in my mind, I wrote a letter to her somewhat to
this effect :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Ever since we met at Brighton you have been kind to me. You have
taken care of me even as a mother of her son. You also think that  I
should get married and with that view you have been introducing me to
young ladies. Rather than allow matters to go further, I  must 
confess to you that I have been unworthy of your affection. I should
have told you when I begen by visits to you that I was married. I
knew that Indian students in England dissembled the fact of their
marriage and I followed suit. I now see that I should not have done
so. I must also add that I was married while yet a boy, and am the
father of a son. I am pained that I should have kept this knowledge
from you so long. But I am glad God has now given me the courage to
speak out the truth. Will you forgive me ? I assure you I have taken
no improper liberties with the young lady you were good enough to
introduce to me. I knew my limits. You, not knowing that I was
married, naturally desired that we should be engaged. In order that
things should not go beyond the present stage, I must tell you the
truth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup></p>

‘If on receipt of this, you feel that I have been unworthy of your
hospitality, I assure you I shall not take it amiss. You have laid me
under an everlasting debt of gratitude by your kindness and
solicitude. If, after this, you do not reject me but continue to
regard me as worthy of your hospitality, which I will spare no pains
to deserve, I shall naturally be happy and count it a further token
of your kindness.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Let the reader know that I could not have written such a letter in a
moment. I must have drafted and redrafted it many times over. But it
lifted a burden that was weighing me down. Almost by return post came
her reply somewhat as follows :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I have your frank letter. We were both very glad and had a hearty

England I came across two Theosophists, brothers, and both unmarried.
They talked to me about the <i>Gita</i>. They were reading Sir Edwin
Arnold’s translation— <i>The </i><i>Song </i><i>Celestial—</i>and
they invited me to read the original with them. I felt ashamed, as I
had read the divine  poem  neither  in Samskrit nor in Gujarati. I
was constrained to tell them that I had not read the <i>Gita</i>, but
that I would gladly read it with them, and that though my knowledge
of Samskrit was meagre, still I hoped to be able to understand the
original to the extent of telling where the translation failed to
bring out the meaning. I began reading the <i>Gita </i>with them. The

The book struck me as one of priceless worth. The impression has ever
since been growing on me with the result that I regard it today as
the book <i>par </i><i>excellence </i>for the knowledge of Truth. It
has afforded me invaluable help in my moments of gloom. I have read
almost all the English translations of it, and I regard Sir Edwin
Arnold’s as the best. He has been faithful to the text<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>,

the <i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita</i>. Once I had begun it I could not
leave off. They also took me on one occasion to the Blavatsky Lodge
and introduced me to<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>Madame
Blavatsky and Mrs. Besant. The latter had just then joined the
Theosophical Society, and I was following with great interest the
controversy about her conversion. The friends advised me to join the
Society, but I politely declined saying, With, my meagre knowledge of
my own<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

I recall having read, at the brothers’ instance, Mad-ame
Blavatsky’s <i>Key </i><i>to </i><i>Theosophy</i>. This book
stimulated in me the desire to read books on Hinduism, and disabused
me of the notion fostered by the missionaries that Hinduism was rife
with superstition.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
About the same time I met a good Christian from Manchester in a
vegetarian boarding house. He talked to me about Christianity. I
narrated to him my Rajkot recollections. He was pained to hear them.
He said, ‘I am a vegetarian. I do not drink. Many Charistians are
meat-eaters and drink, no doubt; but neither meat-eating nor drinking
is enjoined by Scripture<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7</font></sup>.
Do please read the Bible.’ I accepted his advice, and he got me a
copy. I have a faint recollection that he himself used to sell copies
of the Bible, and I purchased from him an edition containing maps,
concordance, and other aids. I began reading it, but I could not
possibly read through the Old Testament. I read the book of Genesis,
and the chapters that followed invariably sent me to sleep. But just
for the sake of being able to say that I had read it, I plodded
through the other books with much difficulty and without the least
interest or understanding. I disliked reading the book  of Numbers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
But the New Testament produced a different impression, especially the
Sermon on the Mount which went straight to my heart. I compared<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>it with the  <i>Git</i><i>a</i>. The verses, ‘But I
say unto you, that ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man
take away thy coat let him have thy cloak too,’ delighted me beyond
measure and put me in mind of Shamal Bhatt’s ‘For a bowl of
water, give a goodly meal’ etc. My young mind tried to unify the
teaching of the <i>Gita, The Light </i><i>of </i><i>Asia </i>and the
Sermon on the Mount. That renunciation was the highest form of
religion<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>appealed to me greatly.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This reading whetted my appetite for studying the lives of other
religious teachers. A friend recommended Carlyle’s <i>Heroes </i><i>and
</i><i>Hero-warship</i>. I read the chapter on the Hero as a prophet
and learnt of the Prophet’s greatness and bravery and austere
living.</p>

outside subjects. But I took mental note of the fact that I should
read more religious books and acquaint myself with all the principal
religions.</p>

And how could I help knowing something of atheism too ? Every Indian
knew Bradlaugh’s name and his so-called atheism. I read some book
about it, the name of which I forget. It had no effect on me, for I
had already crossed the Sahara of atheism. Mrs. Besant who was then
very much in the limelight, had turned to theism from atheism, and
that fact also strengthened my aversion to atheism. I had</p>

It was about this time that Bradlaugh died. He was buried in the
Woking Cemetery. I attended the funeral, as I believe every Indian
residing in London did. A few clergymen also were present to do him
the last honours. On our way back from the funeral we had to wait at
the station for our train. A champion atheist from the crowd heckled
one of these clergymen.‘Well, Sir, you believe in the existence of
God?’</p>

sustains him through trials man has no inkling, much less knowledge,
at the time. If an unbeliever, he will attribute his safety to
chance. If a believer, he will say God saved him. He will conclude as
well he may, that his religious study or spiritual discipline was at
the back of the state of grace within him. But in the hour of his
deliverance he does not know whether his spiritual discipline or
something else saves him.</p>

It was in England that I first discovered the futility of mere
religious knowledge. How I was saved on previous occasions is more
than I can say, for I was very young then<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

as husband and father.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
During the last year, as far as I can remember, of my stay in
England, that is in 1890,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  
</font></sup>there was a Vegetarian Conference at Port- smouth to
which an Indian friend and I were invited. Portsmouth is a sea-port
with a large naval population. It has many  houses  with women of ill
fame, women not actually prostitutes, but at the same time, not very
scrupulous about their morals. We were put up in one of these houses.
Needless to say, the Reception Committee did not know anything about
it. It would have been difficult in a town like Portsmouth to find
out which were good lodgings and which were bad for occasional
travellers like us.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
We returned from the Conference in the evening. After dinner we sat
down to play a rubber of bridge, in which our landlady joined, as is
customary in England even in respectable households. Every player
indulges in innocent jokes as a matter of course, but here my
companion and our hostess began to make indecent ones as well. I did
not know that my friend was an adept in the art. It captured me and I
also joined in. Just when I was about to go beyond the limit, leaving
the cards and the game to themselves, God through the good comp-
anion uttered the blessed warning : ‘Whence this devil in you, my
boy</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.41cm">
? Be off, quick !’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
I was ashamed. I took the warning and expressed within myself
gratefulness to my friend. Remembering the vow I had taken before my
mother, I fled from the scene. To my room I went quaking, trembling,
and with beating heart, like a quarry escaped from its pursuer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I recall this as the first occasion on which a woman, other than my
wife, moved me to lust. I passed that night sleeplessly, all kinds of
thoughts assailing me. Should I leave this house ? Should I run away
from the place ? Where was I ? What would happen to me if I had not
my wits about me ?  I  decided to act thenceforth with great caution;</p>

I did not then know the essence of religion or of God, and how He
works in us. Only vaguely I understood that God had saved me on that

experience can help me to a fuller understanding. But in all my tria
ls—of a spiritual nature, as a lawyer, in conducting institutions,
and in politics—I can say that God saved me. When every hope is
gone, ‘when helpers fail and comforts flee,’ I find that help
arrives some- how, from I know not where. Supplication, worship,
prayer are no superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of
eating, drinking, sitting or walking. It is no exaggeration to say
that they along are real, all else is unreal.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Such
worship or prayer is no flight of eloquence; it is no lip- homage. It
springs from the heart. If, therefore, we achieve that purity of the
heart when it is ‘emptied of all but love’, if we keep all the
chords in proper tune, they ‘trembling pass in music out of sight’.
Prayer needs no speech. It is in itself independent of any sensuous</p>

means of cleansing the heart of passions. But it must be combined
with the utmost humility.</p>

used to sit tongue-tied, never speaking except when spoken to. She
introduced me to Narayan Hemchandra. He did not know English. His
dress was queer—a clumsy pair of trousers, a wrinkled, dirty, brown
coat after the Parsi fashion, no necktie or collar, and a tasselled
woollen cap. He grew a long beard.</p>

his ignorance of grammar as a matter for shame.</p>

a boundless ambition for learning languages and for foreign travel.</p>

Narayan Hemchandra’s simplicity was all his own, and his frankness
was on a par with it. Of pride he had not the slightest trace,
excepting, of course, a rather undue regard for his own capacity as a
writer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We met daily. There was a considerable amount of similarity between
our thoughts and actions. Both of us were vegetarians. We would often
have our lunch together. This was the time when I lived on 17s. a
week and cooked for myself. Sometimes I would go to his room, and
sometimes he would come to mine. I cooked in the English style.
Nothing but Indian style would satisfy him. He could not do without
dal. I would make soup of carrots, etc., and he would pity me for my
taste. Once he somehow hunted out   <i>mung</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

delight. This led on to a regular system of exchange between us. I
would take my delicacies to him and he would bring his to me.</p>

Cardinal Manning’s name was then on every lip. The dock labourers’
strike had come to an early termination  owing  to  the efforts of
John Burns and Cardinal Manning. I told Narayan Hemchandra of
Disraeli’s tribute to the Cardinal’s simplicity. ‘Then I must
see the sage,’ said he.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 0.43cm">

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I wrote a letter to that effect. In two or three days came Cardinal
Manning’s card in reply giving us an appointment. So we both called
on the Cardinal. I put on the usual visiting suit. Narayan Hemchandra
was the same as ever, in the same coat and the same trousers. I tried
to make fun of this, but he laughed me out and said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘You civilized fellows are all cowards. Great men never look at a

We entered the Cardinal’s mansion.   As soon as we were seated,  a
thin, tall, old gentleman made his appearance, and shook hands with
us. Narayan Hemchandra thus gave his greetings :</p>

Once Narayan Hemchandra came to my place in a shirt and dhoti. The
good landlady opened the door, came running to me in a fright—this
was a new landlady who did not know Narayan Hem- chandra<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">9</font></sup>—and
said : ‘A sort of a madcap wants to see you.’ I went to the door
and to my surprise found Narayan Hemchandra. I was shocked. His face,
however, showed nothing but his usual smile.</p>

Narayan Hemchandra went to Paris after a few months’ stay in
London. He began studying French and also translating  French  books.
I knew enough French to revise his translation, so he gave it to me
to read. It was not a translation, it was the substance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Finally
he carried out his determination to visit America. It was with great
difficulty that he succeeded in securing a deck ticket. While in  
the   United   States  he   was  prosecuted<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>for   ‘being   indecently dressed’, as he once
went out in a shirt and dhoti. I have a recollection that he was
discharged.</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2">CHAPTER XXIII : THE
GREAT EXHIBITION</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 95%">
There was a great Exhibition at Paris in 1890. I had<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>read
about its elaborate preparations, and I also had a keen desire to see
Paris. So  I thought I had better combine two things in one and go
there at this juncture. A particular attraction of the Exhi- bition
was the Eiffel Tower, constructed entirely of iron, and nearly 1,000
feet high. There were of course many other things of inte- rest, but
the Tower was the chief one, inasmuch as it had been supposed till
then that a structure of that height could not safely stand.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I  had  heard  of<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>a vegetarian restaurant in Paris. I engaged a room
there and stayed seven days. I managed everything very econ-
omically, both the journey to Paris and the sightseeing there. This I
did mostly on foot and with the help of a map of Paris, as also a map
of and guide to the Exhibition. These were enough to direct one to
the main streets and chief places off interest.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
I remember nothing of the Exhibition excepting its magnitude and
variety. I have fair recollection of the Eiffel Tower as I ascended
it twice or thrice. there was a restaurant on the first platform, and
just for the satisfaction of being able to say that I had had my
lunch at a great height, I threw away seven shillings on it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The ancient churches of Paris are still in my memory. Their grandeur
and their peacefulness are unforgettable. The wonderful constru-ction
of Notre Dame and the elaborate decoration of the interior with its
beautiful sculptures cannot be forgotten. I felt then that those who
expended millions on such divine cathedrals could not but have the
love of God in their hearts.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had read a lot about the fashions and frivolity of Paris. These
were in evidence in every street, but the churches stood noticeably
apart from these scenes. A man would forget the outside noise and
bustle as soon as he entered one of these churches. His manner would</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
change, he would behave with dignity and reverence as he passed
someone kneeling before the image of the Virgin. The feeling I had
then has since been growing on me, that all this kneeling and prayer
could not be mere superstition; the devout souls kneeling before the
Virgin could not be worshipping mere marble. They were fired with</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
genuine devotion and they worshipped not stone, but the divinity of
which it was symbolic. I have an impression that I felt then that by
this worship they were not detracting from, but increasing, the glory
of God.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 101%">
I must say a word about the Eiffel Tower. I do not know what purpose
it serves today.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>But I then heard it greatly disparaged as well as
praised. I remember that Tolstoy was the chief among those who
disparaged it. He said that the Eiffel Tower was a monument of man’s
folly, not of his wisdom. Tobacco, he argued, was the worst of all
into- xicants, inasmuch as a man addicted to it was tempted to commit
crimes which a drunkard never dared to do; liquor made a man mad, but
tobacco clouded his intellect and made him build castles in the
air.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The Eiffel Tower was one of the creations of a man
under such influence.</p>

There is<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>no
art about the Eiffel Tower. In no way can it be said to have
contributed to the real beauty of the Exhibition. Men flocked to see
it and ascended it as it was a novelty and of unique dimensions. It
was the toy of the Exhibition. So long as we are children we are
attracted by toys, and the Tower was a good demonstration of the fact
that we are all children attracted by trinkets. That may be claimed
to be the purpose served by the Eiffel Tower.</p>

I have deferred saying anything up to now about the purpose for which
I went to England, viz., being called to the bar. It is time to
advert to it briefly.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">There
were two conditions which had to be fulfilled before a student was
formally called to the bar : ‘keeping terms’, twelve terms
equivalent to about three years; and passing examinations. ‘Keeping
terms’ meant eating one’s terms, i.e., attending at least six out
of about twenty-four dinners in a term. Eating did not mean actually
partaking of the dinner, it meant reporting oneself at the fixed
hours and remaining present throughout the dinner. Usually of course
everyone ate and drank the good commons and choice wines pro- vided.
A dinner cost from two and six to three and six, that is from two to
three rupees. This was considered moderate, inasmuch as one had to
pay that same amount for wines alone if one dined at a hotel. To us
in India it is a matter for surprise, if we are not ‘civilized’,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>that the cost of drink should exceed the cost of food.
The first revelation gave me a great shock, and I wondered how people
had the heart to throw away so much money on drink. Later Icame to
understand. I often nothing at these dinners, for the things that I
might eat were only bread, boiled potato and cabbage. In the
beginning I did not eat these, as I did not like them; and later,
when I began to relish them, I also gained the courage to ask for
other dishes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
The dinner provided for the benchers used to be better than that for
the students. A Parsi student, who was also a vegetarian, and I
applied, in the interests of vegetarianism, for the vegetarian
courses which were served to the benchers. The application was
granted, and we began to get fruits and other vegetables from the
benchers’ table.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Two bottles of wine were allowed to each group of four, and as I did
not touch them, I was ever in demand to form a quartet, so that three
might empty two bottles. And there was a ‘grand night‘ in each
term when extra wines, like champagne, in addition to port and
sheery, were served.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I was therefore specially requested to attend and was
in great demand on that ‘grand night’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I could not see then, nor have I seen since, how these dinners
qualified the students better for the bar. There was once a time when
only a few students used to attend these dinners and thus there were
opportunities for talks between them and the benchers, and speeches
were also made. These occasions helped to give them knowledge of the
world with a sort of polish and refinement, and also improved their
power of speaking. No such thing was possible in my time, as the
benchers had a table all to themselves.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The institution had gradually</p>

lost all its meaning, but conservative<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>England retained it nevertheless. The curriculum of
study was easy, barristers being humorously known as ‘dinner
barristers’. Everyone knew that the examinations</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
had practically no value. In my time there were two, one in Roman Law
and the other in Common Law. There were regular text-books prescribed
for these examinations which could be taken in compartments, but
scarcely anyone read them. I have known many to pass the Roman Law
examination by scrambling through<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>notes  on Roman Law in a couple of weeks, and the
Common Law examination by reading notes on the subject in two or
three months. Question papers were easy and examiners were generous.
The percentage of passes in the Roman Law examination used to be 95
to 99 and of those in the final examination 75 or even more. There
was thus little fear of being plucked, and examinations were held not
once but four times in the year. They<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>could not be felt as a difficulty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
But I succeeded in turning them into one. I felt that I should read
all the text-books. It was a fraud, I thought, not to read these
books. I invested much money in them. I decided to read Roman Law in
Latin. The Latin which I had acquired in the London Matriculation
stood me in good stead. And all this reading was not without its
value later on in South Africa, where Roman Dutch is the common law.
The reading of Justinian, therefore, helped me a great deal in
understan- ding the South African law.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 101%">
It took me nine months of fairly hard labour to read through the
Common Law of England. For Broom’s <i>Common </i><i>Law</i>, a big
but interesting volume, took up a good deal of time. Snell’s <i>Equity
</i>was full of interest, but a bit hard to understand. White and
Tudor’s <i>Leading Cases</i>, from which certain cases were
prescribed, was full of interest and instruction. I read also with
interest Williams’ and Edwards’ <i>Real Property</i>, and
Goodeve’s <i>Personal Property</i>. Williams’ book read like a
novel. The one<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

was at a loss to know how one could employ this maxim for the bene-

Besides, I had learnt nothing at all of Indian law. I had not the
slightest idea of Hindu and Mahomedan Law. I had not even learnt how
to draft a plaint, and felt completely at sea. I had heard of Sir
Pherozeshah Mehta as one who roared like a lion in law-courts. How, I
wondered, could he have learnt the art in England ? It was out of the
question for me ever to acquire his legal acumen, but I had serious
misgivings as to whether I should be able even to earn a living by

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was torn with these doubts and anxieties whilst I was studying law.
I confided my difficulties to some of my friends. One of them
suggested that I should seek Dadabhai Naoroji’s advice.  I  have
already said that, when I went to England, I possessed a note of
introduction to Dadabhai. I availed myself of it very late. I thought
I had no right to trouble such a great man for an interview. Whenever
an address by him was announced, I would attend it, listen to him
from a corner of the hall and go away after having feasted my eyes
and ears. In order to come in close touch with the students he had
founded an association. I used to attend its meetings, and rejoiced
at Dadabhai’s solicitude for the students, and the latter’s
respect for him. In course of time I mustered up courage to present
to him the note of</p>

introduction. He said : ‘You can  come  and  have  my advice
whenever you like.’ But I never availed myself of his offer. I
thought it   wrong      to   trouble   him   without   the   most  
pressing necessity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
Therefore I dared not venture to accept my friend’s advice to
submit my difficulties to Dadabhai at that time. I forget now whether
it was the same friend or someone else who recommended me to meet Mr.
Frederick Pincott. He was a Conservative, but his affection for
Indian students was pure and unselfish. Many students sought his
advice and  I  also applied to  him for an  appointment, which he 
granted. I can</p>

never forget that interview. He greeted me as a friend. He laughed
away my pessimism. ‘Do you think,’ he said, ‘that everyone must
be a Pherozeshah Mehta ? Pherozeshahs and Badruddins are rare. Rest
assured it takes no unusual skill to be an ordinary lawyer. Common
honesty and industry are enough to enable him to make a living. All
cases are not complicated. Well, let me know the extent of your
general reading.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
When I acquainted him with my little stock of reading, he was, as  I
could see, rather disappointed. But it was only for a moment. Soon
his face beamed with a pleasing smile and he said, ‘I understand
your trouble. Your general reading is meagre. You have no knowledge
of the world, a <i>sine </i><i>qua non </i>for a <i>vakil</i>. You
have not even read the history of India. A <i>vakil </i>should know
human nature. He should be able to read a man’s character from his
face. And every Indian ought to know Indian history. This has no
connection with the practice of law, but you ought to have that
knowledge I see that you have not even read Kaye and Malleson’s
history of the Mutiny of 1857. Get hold of that at once and also read
two more books to understand human nature.’ These were Lavator’s
and Shemmelpennick’s books on physiognomy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I was extremely grateful to this venerable friend. In his presence I
found all my fear gone, but as soon as I left him I began to worry
again. ‘To know a man from his face’ was the question that
haunted me, as I thought of the two books on my way home. The next
day I purchased Lavator’s book. Shemmelpennick’s was not
available at the shop. I read Lavator’s book and found it more
difficult than Snell’s <i>Equity</i>, and scarcely interesting. I
studied Shakespeare’s physi- ognomy, but did not acquire the knack
of finding out the Shak- espeares walking up and down the streets of
London.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Lavator’s book did not add to my knowledge. Mr. Pincott’s advice
did me very little direct service, but his kindness stood me in good
stead. His smiling open face stayed in my memory, and I trusted his
advice that Pherozeshah Mehta’s acumen, memory and ability were not
essential to the making of a successful lawyer; honesty and industry
were enough. And as I had a fair share of these last I felt somewhat
reassured.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I could not read Kaye and Malleson’s volumes in England, but I did

opportunity.</p>

I said in the last chapter that the sea was rough in Bombay harbour,
not an unusual thing in the Arabian Sea in June and July. It had been
choppy all the way from Aden. Almost every passenger was sick; I
alone was in perfect form, staying on deck to see the stormy surge,
and enjoying the splash of the waves. At breakfast there would be
just one or two people besides myself, eating  their  oatmeal 
porridge from plates carefully held in their laps, lest the porridge
itself find its place there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The outer storm was to me a symbol of the inner. But even as the
former left me unperturbed, I think I can say the same thing about
the latter. There was the trouble with the caste that was to confront
me. I have already adverted to my helplessness in starting on  my
profession. And then, as I was a reformer, I was taxing myself as to
how best to begin certain reforms. But there was even more in store
for me than I knew.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My elder brother had come to meet me at the dock. He had already made
the acquaintance of Dr. Mehta and his elder brother, and as Dr. Mehta
insisted on putting me up at his house, we went there. Thus the
acquaintance begun in England continued in India and ripened into a
permanent friendship between the two families.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I was pining to see my mother. I did not know that she was no more in
the flesh to receive me back into her bosom. The sad news was now
given me, and I underwent the usual ablution. My brother</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">

dwell upon it. My grief was even greater than over my father’s 
death. Most of my cherished hopes were shattered. But I remember that
I did not give myself up to any wild expression of grief. I could
even check the tears, and took to life just as though nothing had
happened.</p>

jewellers conducted in the name of Revashankar Jagjivan. He was not
above twenty-five then, but my first meeting with him convinced me
that he was a man of great character and learning. He was also known
as <i>shatavadhani </i>(one having the faculty of remembering or
attending to a hundred things simultaneously), and Dr. Mehta
recommended me to see some of his memory feats. I exhausted my
vocabulary of all the European tongues I knew, and asked the poet to
repeat the words. He did so in the precise order in which I had given
them. I envied his gift without, however, coming under its spell. The
thing that did cast its spell over me I came to know afterwards. This
was his wide knowledge of the scriptures, his spotless character, and
his burning passion for self-realization. I saw later that this last
was the only thing for which he lived. the following lines of
Muktanand were always on his lips and engraved on the tablets of his
heart :</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Raychandbhai’s commercial transactions covered hundreds of
thousands. He was a connoisseur of pearls and diamonds. No knotty
business problem was too difficult for him. But all these things were
not the centre round which his life revolved. That centre was the
passion to see God face to face. Amongst the things on his business
table there were invariably to be found some religious book and his
diary. The moment he finished his business he opened the religious
book or the diary. Much of his published writings is a reproduction
from this diary. The man who, immediately on finishing his talk about
weighty business transactions, began to write about the hidden things
of the spirit could evidently not be a businessman at all, but a real
seeker after Truth. And I saw him thus absorbed in godly pursuits in
the midst of business, not once or twice, but very often. I never saw
him lose his state of equipoise. There was no business or other
selfish tie that bound him to me, and yet I enjoyed the closest
association with him. I was but a briefless barrister then, and yet
whenever I saw him he would engage me in conversation of a seriously
religious nature. Though I was then groping and could not be said to
have any serious interest in religious discussion, still I found his
talk of absorbing interest. I have since met many a  religious 
leader  or teacher. I have tried to meet the heads of various faiths,
and I must say that no one else has ever made on me the impression 
that Raychandbhai did. His words went straight home to me. His
intellect compelled as great a regard from me as his moral
earnestness, and</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
deep down in me was the conviction that he would never willingly lead
me astray and would always confide to me his innermost thoughts. In
my moments of spiritual crisis, therefore, he was my refuge.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And yet in spite of this regard for him I could not enthrone him in
my heart as my Guru. The throne has remained vacant and my search
still continues.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">I
believe in the Hindu theory of Guru and his importance in spiritual
realization. I think there is a great deal of truth in  the doctrine
that true knowledge is impossible without a Guru. An imperfect
teacher may be tolerable in mundane matters, but not in spiritual
matters. Only a perfect  <i>jnani</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

perfection is one’s right. It is its own reward. The rest is in the

generous to a fault. this, combined with his simple nature, had 
attracted to him many friends, and through them he expected to get me
briefs. He had also assumed that I should have a swinging practice

The storm in my caste over my foreign voyage was still brewing. It
had divided the caste into two camps, one of which immediately
readmitted me, while the other was bent on keeping me out. To please
the former my brother took me to Nasik before going to Rajkot, gave
me a bath in the sacred river and, on reaching Rajkot, gave a caste
dinner. I did not like all this. Buy my brother’s love for me was</p>

Nor did I feel even mental resentment against any of the headmen of

</font></sup>I fully respected the caste regulations about
excommunication. According to these, none of my relations, including
my father-in-law and mother-in-law, and even my sister and
brother-in-law, could entertain me; and I would not so much as drink
water at their houses. They were prepared secretly to evade the

secret that I would not do in public.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The result of my scrupulous conduct was that I never had occasion to
be troubled by the caste; nay, I have experienced nothing but
affection and generosity from the general body of the section that
still regards me as<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup>due   to   my   non- resistance. Had I agitated for
being admitted to the caste, had I atte- mpted to divide it into more
camps, had I provoked the caste-men, they would surely have
retaliated, and instead of steering clear of the storm, I should, on
arrival from England, have found myself in a whirlpool of agitation,
and perhaps a party to dissimulation.</p>

My relations with my wife were still not as I desired. Even my stay
in England had not cured me of jealousy. I continued my squeamishness
and suspiciousness in respect of every little thing, and hence all my
cherished desires remained unfulfilled. I had decided that my wife
should learn reading and writing and that I should help her in her
studies, but my lust came in the way and she had to suffer for<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

this was pure folly on my part.</p>

I had planned reform in the education of children. My bro- ther had
children, and my own child which I had left at home when I went to
England was now a boy of nearly four. It was my desire to teach these
little ones physical exercise and make them hardy, and also to give
them the benefit of my personal guidance. In this I had my brother’s
support and I succeeded in my efforts more or less. I very much liked
the company of children, and the habit of playing and joking with
them has stayed with me till today. I have ever since thought that I
should make a good teacher of children.</p>

The necessity for food ‘reform’ was obvious. Tea and coffee had
already found their place in the house. My brother had thought it fit
to keep some sort of English atmosphere ready for me on my</p>

return, and to that end, crockery and such other things, which used
to be kept in the house only for special occasions, were now in
general use. My ‘reforms’ put the finishing touch. I introduced
oat-meal porridge, and cocoa was to replace tea and coffee. But in
truth it became an addition to tea and coffee. Boots and shoes were
already there. I completed the Europeanization by  adding  the 
European dress.</p>

In Bombay I started a household with a cook as incompetent as myself.
He was a Brahmin. I did not treat him as a servant but as a member of
the household. He would pour water over himself but</p>

was completely innocent of the scriptures. But how was I to get a
better cook</p>

FIRST CASE</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst in Bombay, I began, on the one hand, my study of Indian law
and, on the other, my experiments in dietetics in which Virchand
Gandhi, a friend, joined me. My brother, for his part, was trying his
best to get me briefs.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The study of Indian law was a tedious business. The Civil Procedure
Code I could in no way get on with. Not so, however, with the
Evidence Act. Virchand Gandhi was reading for the Solicitor’s
Examination and would tell me all sorts of stories about barristers
and <i>vakils</i>. ‘Sir Pherozeshah’s ability,’ he would say,
‘lies in his profound knowledge of law. He has the Evidence Act by
heart and knows all the cases on the thirty-second section. Badruddin
Tyabji’s wonderful power of argument inspires the judges with awe.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
The stories of stalwarts such as these would unnerve me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is not unusual,’ he would add, ‘for a barrister to vegetate
for five or seven years. That’s why I have signed the articles for
solicitorship. You should count yourself lucky if you can paddle your
own canoe in three years’ time.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Expenses were mounting up every month. To have a barrister’s board
outside the house, whilst still preparing for the barrister’s
profession inside, was a thing to which I could not reconcile myself.
Hence   I   could   not   give   undivided   attention   to   my  
studies.   I<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1 </font></sup>developed
 some  liking  for  the  Evidence  Act<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
  read   Mayne’s <i>Hindu </i><i>Law </i>with deep interest, but I
had not the courage to conduct a case. I was helpless beyond words,
even as the bride come fresh to her father-in-law’s house !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
About this time, I took up<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the case of one Mamibai. It was a ‘small cause’.
‘You will have to pay some commission to the tout,’ I was told. I
emphatically declined.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">‘But
even that great criminal lawyer Mr. So-and-So, who makes three to
four thousand a month, pays commission !’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I do not need to emulate him,’ I rejoined. ‘I should be
content with Rs. 300 a month. Father did not get more.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But those days are gone. Expenses in Bombay have gone up
frightfully. You must be business-like.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was adamant. I gave no commission, but got Mamibai’s case all the
same. It was an easy case. I charged Rs. 30 for my fees. The case was
not likely to last longer than a day.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This was my <i>debut </i>in the Small Causes Court. I appeared for
the defendant and had thus to cross-examine the plaintiff’s
witnesses. I</p>

stood up, but my heart sank into my boots. My head was reeling and I
felt as though the whole court was doing likewise. I could think of
no question to ask. The judge must have laughed, and the <i>vakils </i>no
doubt enjoyed the spectacle. But I was past seeing anything. I sat
down and told the agent that I could not conduct the case, that he
had better engage Patel and have the fee back from me. Mr. Patel was
duly engaged for Rs. 51. To him, of course, the case was child’s
play.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 95%">
I hastened from the Court<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup>,
not knowing whether my client won or lost her case, but I was ashamed
of myself, and decided not to take up any more cases until I had
courage enough to conduct them. Indeed I did not go to Court again
until I went to South Africa. There was no virtue in my decision. I
had simply made a virtue of necessity. There would be no one so
foolish as to entrust his case to me, only to lose it !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But there <i>was </i>another case in store for me at Bombay. It was a
memorial to be drafted. A poor Mussalman’s land was confiscated in
Porbandar. He approached me as the worthy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>son of a worthy father. His case appeared to be weak,
but I consented to draft a memorial for him, the cost of printing to
be borne by him. I drafted it and read it out to friends. They
approved of it, and that to some extent made me feel confident that I
was qualified enough to draft a memorial, as indeed I really was.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>My
business could flourish if I drafted memorials without any fees. But
that would bring no grist to the mill. So I thought I might take up a
teacher’s job. My knowledge of English was good enough, and I
should have loved to teach English to Matriculation boys in some
school. In this way I could have met part at least of the expen- ses.
I came across an advertisement in the papers : ‘Wanted, an Eng-
lish teacher to teach one hour daily. Salary Rs. 75.’ The
advertise- ment was from a famous high school. I applied for the post
and was called for an interview. I went there in high spirits, but
when the principal found that I was not a graduate, he regretfully
refused me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But I have passed the London Matriculation with Latin as my second
language.’</p>

‘True, but we want a graduate.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was no help for it. I wrung my hands in despair. My brother
also felt much worried. We both came to the conclusion that it was no
use spending more time in Bombay. I should settle in Rajkot where my
brother, himself a petty pleader, could give me some work in the
shape of drafting applications and memorials. And then as there was
already a household at Rajkot, the breaking up of the one at Bom- bay
meant a considerable saving. I liked the suggestion. My little esta-</p>

blishment was thus closed after a stay of six months in Bombay.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I used to attend High Court daily whilst in Bombay,but I cannot say
that I learnt anything there. I had not sufficient knowledge to learn
much. Often I could not follow the cases and dozed off. There were
others also who kept me company in this, and thus lightened my load
of shame. After a time, I even lost the sense of shame, as I learnt
to think that it was fashionable to doze in the High Court.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
If the present generation has also its briefless barristers like me
in Bombay, I would commend them a little practical precept about
living. Although I lived in Girgaum I hardly ever took a carriage or
a tramcar. I had made it a rule to walk to the High Court. It took me
quite forty-five minutes, and of course I invariably returned home on
foot. I had inured myself to the heat of the sun. This walk to and
from the Court saved a fair amount of money, and when many of my
friends in Bombay used to fall ill, I do not remember having once had
an illness. Even when I began to earn money, I kept up the practice
of walking to and from the office, and I am still reaping the
benefits of that practice.</p>

FIRST SHOCK</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
Disappointed, I left Bombay and went to Rajkot where I set up my own
office. Here I got along moderately well. Drafting applications and
memorials brought me in, on an average, Rs. 300 a month. For this
work I had to thank influence rather than my own ability, for my
brother’s partner had a settled practice. All applications, etc.,
which were really or to his mind of an important character, he sent
to big barristers. To my lot fell the applications to be drafted on
behalf of his poor clients.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must confess that here I had to compromise the principle of giving
no commission, which in Bombay I had so scrupulously observed. I was
told that conditions in the two cases were different; that whilst in
Bombay commissions had to be paid to touts, here they had to be paid
<i>vakils </i>who briefed you; and that here as in Bombay all
barristers, without exception, paid a percentage of their fees as
commission. The argument of my brother was, for me, unanswerable.
‘You see’, said he, ‘that I am in partnership with another
<i>vakil</i>. I shall always be inclined to make over to you all our
cases with which you can possibly deal, and if you refuse to pay a
commission to my part- ner, you are sure to embarrass me. As you and
I have a joint establish- ment, your fee comes to our common purse,
and I auto- matically get  a share. But what about my partner ?
Supposing he gave the same case to some other barrister, he would
certainly get his commission from him,’ I was taken in by this
plea, and felt that, if I was to practise as a</p>

barrister, I could not press my principle regarding commission in
such cases. That is how I argued with myself, or to put it bluntly,
how I deceived myself. Let me add, however, that I do not remember
even to have given a commission in respect of any other case.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Though I thus began to make both ends meet, I got the first shock of
my life about this time. I had heard what a British officer was like,
but up to now had never been face to face with one.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
My brother had been secretary and adviser to the late Ranasaheb of
Porbandar before he was installed on his gadi, and hanging over his
head at this time was the charge of having given wrong advice when in
that office. The matter had gone to the Political Agent who was
prejudiced against my brother. Now I had known this officer when in
England, and he may be said to have been fairly friendly to me. My
brother thought that I should avail myself of the friendship and,
putting in a good word on his behalf, try to disabuse the Political
Agent of his prejudice. I did not at all like this idea. I should
not, I thought, try to take advantage of a trifling acquaintance in
England. If my brother was really at fault, what use was my
recommendation ? If he was innocent, he should submit a petition in
the proper course and, confident of his innocence, face<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">t1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>the
result. My brother did not relish this advice. ‘You do not know
Kathiawad,’ he said, ‘and you have yet to know the world. Only
influence counts here. It is not proper for you, a brother, to shirk
your duty, when you can clearly put in a good word about me to an
officer you know.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
I could not refuse him, so I went to the officer much against my
will. I knew I had no right to approach him and was fully conscious
that I was compromising self-respect. But I sought an appointment and
got it. I reminded him of the old acquaintance, but I immediately saw
that Kathiawad was different from England; that an officer on leave
was not the same as an officer on duty. The Political Agent owned the
acquaintance, but the reminder seemed to stiffen him. ‘Surely you
have not come here to abuse that acquaintance, have you</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
?’ appeared to be the meaning of that stiffness, and seemed to be
written on his brow. Nevertheless I opened my case. The sahib was
impatient. ‘Your brother is an intriguer. I want to hear nothing
more from you. I have no time. If your brother has anything to say,
let him apply through the proper channel.’ The answer was enough,
was perhaps deserved<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>But selfishness is blind. I went on with my story. The
sahib got up and said: ‘You must go now.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 96%">
‘But please hear me out’, said I. That made him more angry. He
called his peon and ordered him to show me the door. I was still
hesitating<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>when the peon came in, placed his hands on my
shoulders</p>

and put me out of the room.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The sahib went away as also the peon, and I departed fretting and
fuming. I at once wrote out and sent over a note to this effect :
‘You have insulted me. You have assaulted me through your peon. If
you make no amends, I shall have to proceed against you.’</p>

‘You were rude to me. I asked you to go and you would not. I had no
option but to order my peon to show you the door. Even after he asked
you to leave the office, you did not do so. He therefore had to use
just enough force to send you out. You are at liberty to proceed as
you wish.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
With this answer in my pocket, I came home crestfallen, and told my
brother all that had happened. He was grieved, but was at a loss as
to how to console me. He spoke to his <i>vakil </i>friends. For I did
not know how to proceed against the sahib. Sir Pherozeshah Mehta
happened to be in Rajkot at this time, having come down from  Bombay
for some case. But how could a junior barrister like me dare to see
him ? So I sent him the papers of my case, through the <i>vakil </i>who
had engaged him, and begged for his advice. ‘Tell Gandhi,’ he
said, ‘such things are the common experience of many <i>vakils </i>and
bar- rister. He is still fresh from England, and hot-blooded. He does
not know British officers. If he would earn something and have an
easy time here, let him tear up the note and pocket the insult. He
will gain nothing by proceeding against the sahib, and on the
contrary will very likely ruin himself. Tell him he has yet to know
life.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
The advice was as bitter as poison to me, but I had to swallow it. I
pocketed the insult, but also profited by it. Never again shall I
place myself in such a false position, never again shall I try to
exploit</p>

never been guilty of a breach of that detemination. This shock
changed the course of my life.</p>

I was no doubt at fault in having gone to that officer. But his
impatience and overbearing anger were out of all proportion to my
mistake. It did not warrant expulsion. I can scarcely have taken up
more than five minutes of his time. But he simply could not endure my
talking. He could have politely asked me to go, but power had
intoxicated him to an inordinate extent. Later I came to know that</p>

patience was not one of the virtues of this officer. It was usual for
him to insult his visitors. The slightest unpleasantness was sure to
put the sahib out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Now most of my work would naturally be in his court. It was beyond me
to conciliate him. I had no desire to curry favour with him. Indeed,
having once threatened to proceed against him, I did not like to
remain silent.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Meanwhile I began to learn something of the petty politics of the
country. Kathiawad, being a conglomeration of small States, naturally
had its rich crop of politicals. Petty intrigues between States, and
intrigues of officers for power were the order of the day. Princes
were always at the mercy of others and ready to lend their ears to
sycophants. Even the sahib’s peon had to be cajoled, and the
sahib’s shirastedar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>was
more than his master, as he was his eyes, his ears and his
interpreter. The <i>shirastedar’s </i>will was law, and his income
was always reputed to be more than the sahib’s. This may have been
an exaggeration, but he certainly lived beyond his salary.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This atmosphere appeared to me to be poisonous, and how to remain
unscathed was a perpetual problem for me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was thoroughly depressed and my brother clearly saw it. We both
felt that, if I could secure some job, I should be free from this
atmosphere of intrigue. But without intrigue a ministership or
judgeship was out of the question. And the quarrel with the sahib
stood in the way of practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Porbandar was then under administration, and I had some work there in
the shape of securing more powers for the Prince. Also I had to see
the Administrator in respect of the heavy <i>vighoti</i><i> </i>(land
rent)</p>

exacted from the Mers. This officer, though an Indian, was, I found,
one better than the sahib in arrogance. He was able, but the ryots
appeared to me to be none the better off for his ability. I succeeded
in</p>

securing a few more powers for the Rana, but hardly any relief for
the Mers. It struck me that their cause was not even carefully gone
into.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So even in this mission I was comparatively disappointed. I thought
justice was not done to my clients, but I had not the means to secure
it. At the most I could have appealed to the Political Agent or to
the Governor who whould have dismissed the appeal saying, ‘We
decline to interfere.’ If there had been any rule or regulation
governing such decisions, it would have been something, but here the
sahib’s will was law.</p>

In the meantime a Meman firm from Porbandar wrote to my brother
making the following offer : ‘We have business in South Africa.
Ours is a big firm, and we have a big case there in the Court, our
claim being £40,000. It has been going on for a long time. We have
engaged the services of the best <i>vakils </i>and barristers. If you
sent your brother there, he would be useful to us and also to
himself. He would be able to instruct our counsel better than
ourselves. And he would have the advantage of seeing a new part of
the world, and of making new acquaintances.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My brother discussed the proposition with me. I could  not clearly
make out whether I had simply to instruct the counsel or to appear in
court. But I was tempted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My brother introduced me to the late Sheth Abdul Karim Jhaveri, a
partner of Dada Abdulla &amp; Co., the firm in question. ‘It won’t
be a difficult job,’ the Sheth assured me. ‘We have big Europeans
as our friends, whose acquaintance you will make. you can be useful
to us in our shop. Much of our correspondence is in English and you
can help us with that too. You will, of course, be our guest and
hence will have no expense whatever.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘How long do you require my services ?’ I asked. ‘And what will
be the payment ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Not more than a year. ‘We will pay you a first class return fare
and a sum of £105, all found.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This was hardly going there as a barrister. It was going as a servant
of the firm. But I wanted somehow to leave India. There was also the
tempting opportunity of seeing a new country and of having new
experience. Also I could send £105 to my brother and help in the
expenses of the household. I closed with the offer  without  any
higgling and got ready to go to South Africa.</p>

When starting for South Africa I did not feel the wrench of
separation which I had experienced when leaving for England. My
mother was now no more. I had gained some knowledge of the world and
of travel abroad, and going from Rajkot to Bombay was no unusual
affair.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
This time I only felt the pang of parting with my wife. Another baby
had been born to us since my return from England. Our love could not
yet be called free from lust, but it was getting gradually purer.
Since my return from Europe, we had lived very little together; and
as I had now become her teacher, however indifferent, and helped</p>

her to make certain reforms, we both felt the necessity of being more
together, if only to continue the reforms. But the attraction of
South Africa rendered the separation bearable. ‘We are bound to
meet again in a year,’ I said to her, by way of consolation, and
left Rajkot for Bombay.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Here I was to get my passage through the agent of Dada Abdulla and
Company. But no berth was available on the boat, and if I did not
sail then, I should be stranded in Bombay.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>‘We
have tried our best,’ said the agent, ‘to secure a first-class
passage, but in vain— unless you are prepared to go on deck. Your
meals can be arranged for in the salloon.’ Those were the days of
my first-class travelling, and how could a barrister travel as a deck
passenger ? So I refused the offer. I suspected the agent’s
veracity, for I could not believe that a first-class passage was not
available. With the agent’s consent I set about securing it myself.
I went on board the boat and met the chief officer. He said to me
quite frankly, ‘We do not usually have such a rush. But as the
Goveror-General of Mozambique is going by this boat, all the berths
are engaged.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">
‘Could you not possibly squeeze me in ?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
He surveyed me from top to toe and smiled. ‘There is just one way,’
he said. ‘There is an extra berth in my cabin, which is usually not
available for passengers. But I am prepared to give it to you.’ I<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2
</font></sup>thanked him and got the agent to purchase the passage.
In April 1893  I set forth full of zest to try my luck in South
Africa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The first port of call was Lamu, which we reached in about thirteen
days. The Captain and I had become great friends by this time. He was
fond of playing chess, but as he was quite a novice, he wanted one
still more of a beginner for his partner, and so he invited me. I had
heard a lot about the game but had never tried my hand at it. Players
used to say that this was a game in which there was plenty of scope
for the exercise of one’s intelligence. The Captain offered to give
me lessons, and he found me a good pupil as I had unlimited patience.
Every time I was the loser, and that made him all the more eager to
teach me. I liked the game, but never carried my liking beyond the
boat or my knowledge beyond the boat or my knowledge beyond the moves
of the pieces.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
At Lamu the ship remained at anchor for some three to four hours, and
I landed to see the port. The Captain had also gone ashore, but he
had warned me that the harbour was treacherous and that I should
return in good time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was a very small place. I went to the Post Office and was
delighted to see the Indian clerks there, and had a talk with them. I</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
also saw the Africans and tried to acquaint myself with their ways of
life which interested me very much. This took up some time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were some deck passengers with whom I had made acquaintance,
and who had landed with a view to cooking their food on shore and
having a quiet meal. I now found them preparing to</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
return to the steamer, so we all got into the same boat. The tide was
high in the harbour and our boat more than its proper load. The
current was so strong that it was impossible to hold the boat to the
ladder of the steamer. It would just touch the ladder and be drawn
away again by the current. The first whistle to start had already
gone. I was worried. The Captain was witnessing our plight from the
bridge. He ordered the steamer to wait an extra five minutes. There 
was another boat near the ship which a friend hired for me for ten
rupees. This boat picked me up from the overloaded one. The ladder
had already been raised. I had therefore to be drawn up by means of a
rope and the steamer started immediately. The other passengers were
left behind. I now appreciated the Captain’s warning.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
After Lamu the next port was Mombasa and then Zanzibar. The halt here
was a long one—eight or ten days—and we then changed to another
boat.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The Captain liked me much but the liking took an undesirable turn. He
invited an English friend and me to accompany him on an outing, and
we all went ashore in his boat. I had not the least notion of what
the outing meant. And little did the Captain know what an ignoramus I
was in such matters. We were taken to some Negro women’s quarters
by a tout. We were each shown into a room. I simply stood there dumb
with shame. Heaven only knows what the poor woman must have thought
of me. When the Captain called me I came out just as I had gone in.
He saw my innocence. At first I felt very much ashamed, but as I
could not think of the thing except with horror, the sense of shame
wore away, and I thanked God that the sight of the woman had not
moved me in the least. I was disgusted at my weakness and pitied
myself for not having had the courage to refuse to go into the room.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
This in my life was the third trial of its kind. Many a youth, inn-
ocent at first must have been drawn into sin by a false sense of
shame. I could claim no credit for having come out unscathed. I could
have credit if I had refused to enter that room. I must entirely
thank the All-merciful for having saved me. The incident increased my
faith in God and taught me, to a certain extent, to cast off false
shame.</p>

The port of Natal is Durban, also known as Port Natal. Abdulla Sheth
was there to receive me. As the ship arrived at the quay and I
watched the people coming on board to meet their friends, I observed
that the Indians were not held in much respect. I could not fail to
notice a sort of snobbishness about the manner in which those who
knew Abdulla Sheth behaved to-wards him, and it stung me. Abdulla
Sheth had got used to it. Those who looked at me did so with a
certain amount of curiosity. My dress marked me out from other
Indians. I had a frock-coat and a turban, an imitation of the Bengal
pugree.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">I
was taken to the firm’s quarters and shown into the room set apart
for me, next to Abdulla Sheth’s. He did not understand me. I could
not understand him. He read the papers his brother had sent through
me, and felt more puzzled<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>.
He thought his brother had sent him a white elephant. My style of
dress and living struck him as being expensive like that of the
Europeans.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>There
was no particular work then which could be given me. Their case was
going on in the Transvaal. There was no meaning in sending me there
immediately. And how far could he trust my ability and honesty ? He
would not be in Pretoria to watch me. The defendants were in
Pretoria, and for aught he knew they might bring undue influence to
bear on me. And if work in connection with the case in question was
not to be entrusted to me, what work could I be given to do, as all
other work could be done much better by his clerks ? The clerks could
be brought to book, if they did wrong. Could I be, if I also happened
to err ?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>So
if no work in connection with the case could be given me, I should
have to be kept for nothing.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Abdulla Sheth was practically unlettered, but he had a rich fund of
experience. He had an acut intellect and was conscious of it. By
practice he had picked up just sufficient English for conversational
purposes, but that served him for carrying on all his business,
whether it was dealing with Bank Managers and European merchants or
explaining his case to his counsel. The Indians held him in very high
esteem. His firm was then the biggest, or at any rate one of the
biggest, of the Indian firms. With all these advantages he had one
disadvantage<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>—he
was by nature suspicious.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
He was proud of Islam and loved to discourse on Islamic philosophy.
Though he did not know Arabic, his acquaintance with the Holy Koran
and Islamic literature in general was fairly good. Illustrations he
had in plenty, always ready at hand. Contact with him gave me a fair
amount of practical knowledge of Islam. When we came closer to each
other, we had long discussions on religious topics.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On the second or third day of my arrival, he took me to see the
Durban court. There he introduced me to several people and seated me
next to his attorney. The Magistrate kept staring at me and finally
asked me to take off my turban. This I refused to do and left the
court.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
So here too there was fighting in store for me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Abdulla Sheth explained to me why some Indians were required to take
off their turbans. Those wearing the  Mussalman  costume might, he
said, keep their turbans on, but the other Indians on entering a
court had to take theirs off as a rule.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must enter into some details to make this nice distinction
intelligible. In the course of these two or three days I could see
that the Indians were divided into different groups. One was that of
Mussalman merchants, who would call themselves ‘Arabs’. Another
was that of Hindu, and yet another of Parsi, clerks. The Hindu clerks
were neither here nor there, unless they cast in their lot with the
‘Arabs’. The Parsi clerks would call themselves Persians. These
three classes had some social relations with one another. But by far
the largest class was that composed of Tamil, Telugu and North Indian
indentured and freed labourers. The indentured labourers were those
who went to Natal on an agreement to serve for five years, and came
to be known there as <i>girmitiyas </i>from <i>girmit</i>, which was
the corrupt form of the English word ‘agreement’. The other three
classes had none but business relations with this class. Englishmen
called them ‘coolies’ and as the majority of Indians belonged to
the labouring class, all Indians were called ‘coolies’, or
‘<i>samis</i>’. ‘ <i>Sami </i>’ is a Tamil suffix occurring
after many Tamil names, and it is nothing else than the Samskrit
<i>swami</i>, meaning a master. Whenever therefore, an Indian
resented being addressed as a ‘<i>sam</i><i>i</i>’ and had enough
wit<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>in him, he would try to return the compliment in this
wise : ‘You may call me <i>sami</i>, but you forget that <i>sami
</i>means a master. I am not your master !’ Some Englishmen would
wince at this, while others would get angry, swear at the Indian and,
if there was a chance, would even belabour him; for ‘<i>sami</i>’
to him was nothing better than a term of contempt. To interpret it to
mean a master amounted to an insult !</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.06cm">
I was hence known as a ‘coolie barrister’. The merchants were</p>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
known as ‘coolie merchants’. The original meaning of the word
‘coolie’ was thus forgotten, and it became a common appellation
for all Indians.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The Mussalman merchant would resent this and say : ‘I
am not a coolie, I am an Arab,’ or ‘I am a merchant,’ and the
Englishman, if courteous, would apologize to him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">The
question of wearing the turban had a great importance in this state
of things. Being obliged to take off one’s Indian turban would be
pocketing an insult. So I thought I had better bid good-bye to the
Indian turban and begin wearing an English hat, which would save me
from the insult and the unpleasant controversy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But Abdulla Sheth disapproved of the idea. He said, ‘If you do
anything of the kind, it will have a very bad effect. You will
compromise those insisting on wearing Indian turbans. And an Indian
turban sits well on your head. If you wear an English hat, you will
pass for a waiter.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was practical wisdom, patriotism and a little bit of narrowness
in this advice. The wisdom was apparent, and he would not have
insisted on the Indian turban except out of patriotism; the slighting
reference to the waiter betrayed a kind of narrowness. Amongst the
identured Indians there were three classes—Hindus, Mussalmans and
Christians. The last were the children of indentured Indians who
became converts to Christianity. Even in 1893 their number was large.
They wore the English costume, and the majority of them earned their
living by service as waiters in hotels. Abdulla Sheth’s criticism
of the English hat was with reference to this class. It was
considered degrading to serve as a waiter in a hotel. The belief
persists even today among many.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">On
the whole I liked Abdulla Sheth’s advice. I wrote to the Press
about the incident and defended the wearing of my turban in the
court. The question was very much discussed in the papers, which
described me as an ‘unwelcome visitor’. Thus the incident gave me
an unexpected advertisement in South Africa within a few days of my
arrival there. Some supported me while others severely criticized my
temerity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 96%">
My turban stayed with me practically until the end of my stay in
South Africa. When and why I left off wearing any head-dress at all
in South Africa, we shall see later.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup></p>

I soon came in contact with the Christian Indians living in Durban.
The Court Interpreter, Mr. Paul, was a Roman Catholic. I made his
acquaintance, as also that of the late Mr. Subhan Godfrey, then a
teacher under the Protestant Mission, and father of Mr. James</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Godfrey, who, as a member of the South African Deputation, visited
India in 1924. I likewise met the late Parsi Rustomji and the late
Adamji Miyakhan about the same time. All these friends, who up to
then had never met one another except on business, came ultimately
into close contact, as we shall see later.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst I was thus widening the circle of my acquaintance, the firm
received a letter from their lawyer saying that  preparations  should
be made for the case, and that Abdulla Sheth should go to Pretoria
himself or send a representative.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Abdulla Sheth gave me this letter to read, and asked me if I would go
to Pretoria. ‘I can only say after I have understood the case from
you,’ said I. ‘At present I am at a loss to know what I have to
do there.’ He thereupon asked his clerks to explain the case to me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As I began to study the case, I felt as though I ought to begin from
A B C of the subject.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>During
the few days I had at Zanzibar, I had been to the court to see the
work there. A Parsi lawyer was examining a witness and asking him
questions regarding credit and debit entries in account books. It was
all Greek to me. Book-keeping I had learnt neither at school nor
during my stay in England. And the case for which I had come to South
Africa was mainly about accounts. Only one who knew accounts could
understand and explain it. The clerk went on talking about this
debited and that credited, and I felt more and more confused. I did
not know what a P. Note meant. I failed to find the word in the
dictionary. I revealed my ignorance to the clerk, and learnt from him
that a P. Note meant a promissory note.  I purchased a book on
book-keeping and studied it. That gave me some confidence. I
understood the case. I saw that Abdulla Sheth, who did not know how
to keep accounts, had so much practical knowledge that he could
quickly solve intricacies of book-keeping. I told him that I was
prepared to go to Pretoria.</p>

‘Then I shall write to our lawyer. He will arrange for your

Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad was a near relative of  Abdulla Sheth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The mention of a probable settlement somewhat startled the Sheth, I
could see. But I had already been six or  seven  days  in Durban, and
we now knew and understood each other. I was no longer a ‘white
elephant’. So he said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Y…es, I see. There would be nothing better than a settlement out
of court. But we are all relatives and know one another very well
indeed. Tyeb Sheth is not a man to consent to a settlement easily.
With the slightest unwariness on our part, he would screw all sorts
of things out of us, and do us down in the end. So please think twice
before you do anything.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Don’t be anxious about that,’ said I. ‘I need not talk to
Tyeb Sheth, or for that matter to anyone else, about the case. I
would only suggest to him to come to an understanding, and so save a
lot of unnecessary litigation.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On the seventh or eighth day after my arrival, I left Durban. A
first-class seat was booked for me. It was usual there to pay five
shillings extra, if one needed a bedding. Abdulla Sheth insisted that
I should book one bedding but, out of obstinacy and pride and with a
view to saving five shillings, I declined. Abdulla Sheth warned me.
‘Look, now,’ said he, ‘this is a different country from India.

p.m. Beddings used to be provided at this station. A railway servant
came and asked me if I wanted one. ‘No,’ said I, ‘I have one
with me.’ He went away. But a passenger came next, and looked me up
and down. He saw that I was a ‘coloured’ man. This disturbed him.
Out he went and came in again with one or two officials. They all
kept quiet, when another official came to me and said, ‘Come along,
you must go to the van compartment.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
‘But I have a first-class ticket,’ said I.</p>

‘That doesn’t matter,’ rejoined the other. ‘I tell you, you

out.’ ‘Yes, you may. I refuse to get out voluntarily.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
The constable came. He took me by the hand and pushed me out. My
luggage was also taken out. I refused to go to the other compartment
and the train steamed away. I went and sat in the waiting room,
keeping my hand-bag with me, and leaving the other luggage where it
was. The railway authorities had taken<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>charge of it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was winter, and winter in the higher regions of South Africa is
severely cold. Maritzburg being at a high altitude, the cold was
extremely bitter. My over-coat was in my luggage, but I did not dare
to ask for it lest I should be insulted again, so I sat and shivered.
There was no light in the room. A passenger came in at about midnight
and possibly wanted to talk to me. But I was in no mood to talk.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I began to think of my duty. Should I fight for my rights or go back
to India, or should I go on to Pretoria without minding the insults,
and return to India after finishing the case ? It would be cowardice
to run back to India without fulfilling my obligation. The hardship
to which I was subjected was superficial—only a symptom of the deep
disease of colour prejudice. I should try, if possible, to root out
the disease and suffer hardships in the process. Redress for wrongs I
should seek only to the extent that would be necessary for the
removal of the colour prejudice.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">
So I decided to take the next available train to Pretoria<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The following morning I sent a long telegram to the General Manager
of the Railway and also informed Abdulla Sheth, who immediately met
the General Manager. The Manager justified the conduct of the railway
authorities, but informed him that he had already instructed the
Station Master to see that I reached my destination safely. Abdulla
Sheth wired to the Indian merchants in Maritzburg and to friends in
other places to meet me and look after me. The merchants came to see
me at the station and tried to comfort me by narrating their own
hardships and explaining that what had happened to me was nothing
unusual. They also said that Indians travelling first or second class
had to expect trouble from railway officials and white passengers.
The day was thus spent in listening to these tales of woe. The
evening train arrived. There was a reserved berth for me. I now
purchased at Maritzburg the bedding ticket I had refused to book at
Durban.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.04cm">
The train took me to Charlestown.</p>

The train reached Charlestown in the morning. There was no</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
railway, in those days, between Charlestown and Johannesburg, but
only a stage-coach, which halted at Standerton for the night <i>en
</i><i>route</i>.  I possessed a ticket for the coach, which was not
cancelled by the break of the journey at Maritzburg for a day;
besides, Abdulla Sheth had sent a wire to the coach agent at
Charlestown.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But the agent only needed a pretext for putting me off, and so, when
he discovered me to be a stranger, he said, ‘Your ticket is
cancelled.’ I gave him the proper reply. The reason at the back of
his mind was not want of accommodation, but quite another. Passengers
had to be accommodated inside the coach, but as I was regarded as a
‘coolie’ and looked a stranger, it would be proper, thought the
‘leader’, as the white man in charge of the coach was called, not
to seat me with the white passengers. There were seats on either side
of the coachbox. The leader sat on one of these as a rule. Today he
sat inside and gave me his seat. I knew it was sheer injustice and an
insult, but I thought it better to pocket it. I could not have forced
myself inside, and if I had raised a protest, the coach would have
gone off without me. This would have meant the loss of another day,
and Heaven only knows what would have happened the next day.  So,
much as I fretted within myself, I prudently sat next the coachman.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
At about three o’clock the coach reached Pardekoph. Now the leader
desired to sit where I was seated, as he wanted to smoke and possibly
to have some fresh air. So he took a piece of dirty sack-cloth from
the driver, spread it on the footboard and, addressing me said, ‘
<i>Sami </i>, you sit on this, I want to sit near the driver.’ The
insult was more than I could bear. In fear and trembling I said to
him, ‘It was you who seated me here, though I should have been
accommodated inside. I put up with the insult. Now that you want to
sit outside and smoke, you would have me sit at your feet. I will not
do so, but I am prepared to sit inside.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As I was struggling through these sentences, the man came down upon
me and began heavily to box my ears. He seized me by the arm and
tried to drag me down. I clung to the brass rails of the coachbox and
was determined to keep my hold even at the risk of breaking my
wristbones. The passengers were witnessing the scene<font size="2">—</font>the
man swearing at me, dragging and belabouring me, and I remaining
still. He was strong and I was weak. Some of the passengers were
moved to pity and exclaimed : ‘Man, let him alone. Don’t beat
him. He is not to blame. He is right. If he can’t stay there, let
him come and sit with us.’ ‘No fear,’ cried the man, but he
seemed somewhat crestfallen and stopped beating me. He let go my arm,
swore at me a little more, and asking the Hottentot servant who was
sitting on the other side of the coachbox to sit on the footboard,
took the seat so vacated.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
The passengers took their seats and, the whistle given, the coach
rattled away. My heart was beating fast within my breast, and I was
wondering whether I should ever reach my destination alive. The man
cast an angry look at me now and then and, pointing his finger at me,
growled : ‘Take care, let me once get to Standerton and I shall
show you what I do.’ I sat speechless and prayed to God to help me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After dark we reached Standerton and I heaved a sigh of relief on
seeing some Indian faces. As soon as I got down, these friends said</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
: ‘We are here to receive you and take you to Isa Sheth’s shop.
We have had a telegram from Dada Abdulla.’ I was very glad, and we
went to Sheth Isa Haji Sumar’s shop. The Sheth and his clerks
gathered round me. I told them all that I had gone through. They were
very sorry to hear it and comforted me by relating to me their own
bitter experiences.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I wanted to inform the agent of the Coach Company of the whole
affair. So I wrote him a letter, narrating everything that had
happened, and drawing his attention to the threat his man had held
out. I also asked for an assurance that he would accommodate me with
the other passengers inside the coach when we started the  next
morning. To which the agent replied to this effect : ‘From
Standerton we have a bigger coach with different men in charge. The
man complained of will not be there tomorrow, and you will have a
seat with the other passengers.’ This somewhat relieved me. I had,
of course, no intention of proceeding against the man who had
assaulted me, and so the chapter of the assault closed there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
In the morning Isa Sheth’s man<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>took me to the coach, I got a good seat and reached
Johannesburg quite safely that night.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Standerton is a small village and Johannesburg a big city. Abdulla
Sheth had wired to Johannesburg also, and given me the name and
address of Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin’s firm there. Their man had
come to receive me at the stage, but neither did I see him nor did he
recognize me. So I decided to go to a hotel. I knew the names of
several. Taking a cab I asked to be driven to the Grand National
Hotel. I saw the Manager and asked for a room. He eyed me for a
moment, and politely saying, ‘I am very sorry, we are full up’,
bade me good-bye. So I asked the cabman to drive to Muhammad Kasam
Kamruddin’s shop. Here I found Abdul Gani Sheth expecting me, and
he gave me a cordial greeting. He had a hearty laugh over the story
of my experience at the hotel. ‘How ever did you expect to be
admitted to a hotel ?’ he said.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.04cm">
‘Why not ?’ I asked.</p>

said he. ‘Only <i>we </i>can live in a land like this, because, for
making money, we do not mind pocketing insults, and here we are.’
With this he narrated to me the story of the hardships of Indians in
South Africa.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He said : ‘This country is not for men like you. Look now, you have
to go to Pretoria tomorrow. You will <i>have </i>to travel third
class. Conditions in the Transvaal are worse than in Natal. First and
second- class tickets are never issued to Indians.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.09cm">
‘You cannot have made persistent effort in this direction.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘We have sent representations, but I confess our own men too do not
want as a rule to travel first or second.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I sent for the railway regulations and read them. There was a
loophole. The language of the old Transvaal enactments was not very
exact or precise; that of the railway regulations was even less so.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I said to the Sheth : ‘I wish to go first class, and if I cannot, I
shall prefer to take a cab to Pretoria, a matter of only thirty-seven
miles.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Sheth Abdul Gani drew my attention to the extra time  and money this
would mean, but agreed to my proposal to travel first, and
accordingly we sent a note to the Station Master. I mentioned in my
note that I was a barrister and that I always travelled first. I also
stated in the letter that I needed to reach Pretoria as early as
possible, that as there was no time to await his reply I would
receive it in person at the station, and that I should expect to get
a first-class ticket. There was of course a purpose behind asking for
the reply in person. I thought that if the Station Master gave a
written reply, he would certainly say ‘no’, especially because he
would have his own notion of a ‘coolie’ barrister. I would
therefore appear before him in faultless English dress, talk to him
and possibly persuade him to issue a first-class ticket. So I went to
the station in a frock-coat and necktie, placed a sovereign for my
fare on the counter and asked for a first-class ticket.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.08cm">
‘You sent me that note ?’ he asked.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.08cm">
‘That is so. I shall be much obliged if you will give me a ticket.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
He smiled and, moved to pity, said: ‘I am not a Transvaaler. I am a
Hollander. I appreciate your feelings, and you have  my sympathy. I
do want to give you a ticket—on one condition, however, that, if
the guard should ask you to shift to the third class, you will not
involve me in the affair, by which I mean that you should not proceed</p>

are a gentleman.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
With these words he booked the ticket. I thanked him and gave him the
necessary assurance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sheth Abdul Gani had come to see me off at the station. The incident
gave him an agreeable surprise, but he warned me saying : ‘I shall
be thankful if you reach Pretoria all right. I am afraid the guard
will not leave you in peace in the first-class and even if he does,
the passengers will not.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I took my seat in a first-class compartment and the train started. At
Germiston the guard came to examine the tickets. He was angry to find
me there, and signalled to me with his finger to go to the third
class. I showed him my first-class ticket. ‘The doesn’t matter,’
said he, ‘remove to the third class.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was only one English passenger in the compartment. He took the
guard to task. ‘What do you mean by  troubling  the gentleman ?’
he said. ‘Don’t you see he has a first-class ticket ? I do not
mind in the least his travelling with me.’ Addressing me, he said,
‘You should make yourself comfortable where you are.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The guard muttered : ‘If you want to travel with a coolie, what do
I care ?’ and went away.</p>

I had expected someone on behalf of Dada Abdulla’s attorney to meet
me at Pretoria station. I knew that no Indian would be there to
receive me, since I had particularly promised not to put up at an
Indian house. But the attorney had sent no one. I understood later
that, as I had arrived on a Sunday, he could not have sent anyone
without inconvenience. I was perplexed, and wondered where to go, as 
I feared that no hotel would accept me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Pretoria station in 1893 was quite different from what it was in
1914. The lights were burning dimly. The travellers were few. I let
all the other passengers go and thought that, as soon as  the  ticket
 collector was fairly free, I would hand him my ticket and ask him if
he could direct me to some small hotel or any other such place where
I might go; otherwise I would spend the night at the station. I must
confess I shrank from asking him even this, for I was afraid of being
insulted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The station became clear of all passengers. I gave my ticket to the
ticket collector and began my inquiries. He replied to me
courteously, but I saw that he could not be of any considerable help.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
But an American Negro who was standing near by broke into the
conversation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I see,’ said he, ‘that you are an utter stranger here, without
any friends. If you will come with me, I will take you to a small
hotel, of which the proprietor is an American who is very well known
to me. I think he will acept you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had my own doubts about the offer, but I thanked him and accepted
his suggestion. He took me to Johnston’s Family Hotel. He drew Mr.
Johnston aside to speak to him, and the latter agreed to accommodate
me for the night, on condition that I should have my dinner served in
my room.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I assure you,’ said he, ‘that I have no colour prejudice. But
I have only European custom, and, if I allowed you to eat in the
dining- room, my guests might be offended and even go away.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Thank you,’ said I, ‘even for accommodating me for the night. 
I am now more or less acquainted with the conditions here, and I
understand your difficulty. I do not mind your serving the dinner in
my room. I hope to be able to make some other arrangement tomorrow.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was shown into a room, where I now sat waiting for the dinner and
musing, as I was quite alone. There were not many guests in the
hotel, and I had expected the waiter to come very shortly with the
dinner. Instead Mr. Johnston appeared. He said : ‘I was ashamed of
having asked you to have your dinner here. So I spoke to the other
guests about you, and asked them if they would mind your having your
dinner in the dining-room. They said they had no objection, and that
they did not mind your staying here as long as you liked. Please,
therefore, come to the dining-room, if you will, and stay here as
long as you wish.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I thanked him again, went to the dining-room and had a hearty dinner.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Next morning I called on the attorney, Mr. A.  W.  Baker. Abdulla
Sheth had given me some description of him; so his cordial reception
did not surprise me. He received me very warmly and made kind
inquiries. I explained all about myself. Thereupon he said : ‘We
have no work for you here as barrister, for we have engaged the best
counsel. The case is a prolonged and complicated one, so I shall take
your assistance only to the extent of getting necessary information.
And of course you will make communication with my client easy for me,
as I shall now ask for all the information I want from him through
you. That is certainly an advantage. I have not yet found rooms for
you. I thought I had better do so after having seen you. There is a</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
fearful amount of colour prejudice here, and therefore it is not easy
to find lodgings for such as you. But I know a poor woman. She is the
wife of a baker. I think she will take you and thus add to her income
at the same time. Come, let us go to her place.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So he took me to her house. He spoke with her privately about me, and
she agreed to accept me as a boarder at 35 shillings a week.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Baker, besides being an attorney, was a staunch lay prea- cher.
He is still alive and now engaged purely in missionary work, having
given up the legal profession. He is quite well-to-do. He still
corresponds with me. In his letters he always dwells on the same
theme. He upholds the excellence of Christianity from various points
of view, and contends that it is impossible to find eternal peace,
unless one accepts Jesus as the only son of God and the Saviour of
mankind.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
During the very first interview Mr. Baker ascertained my religious
views. I said to him : ‘I am a Hindu by birth. And yet I do not
know much of Hinduism, and I know less of other religions. In fact I
do not know where I am, and what is and what should be my belief. I
intend to make a careful study of my own religion and, as far as I
can, of other religions as well.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Baker was glad to hear all this, and said : ‘I am one of the
Directors of the South Africa General Mission. I have built a church
at my own expense, and deliver sermons in it regularly. I am free
from colour prejudice. I have some co-workers, and we meet at one
o’clock every day for a few minutes and pray for peace and light. I
shall be glad if you will join us there. I shall introduce you to my
co-workers who will be happy to meet you, and I dare say you will
also like their company. I shall give you, besides, some religious
books to read, though of course the book of books is the Holy Bible,
which I would specially recommend to you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I thanked Mr. Baker and agreed to attend the one  o’clock prayers
as regularly as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘So I shall expect you here tomorrow at one o’clock, and we shall

I went to Mr. Johnston, paid the bill and removed to the new
lodgings, where I had my lunch. The landlady was a good woman. She
had cooked a vegetarian meal for me. It was not long before I made
myself quite at home with the family.</p>

I next went to see the friend to whom Dada Abdulla had given me a

Africa. He insisted that I should stay with him. I thanked him, and
told him I had already made arrangements. He urged me not to</p>

It was now dark. I returned home, had my dinner, went to my room and
lay there absorbed in deep thought. There was not any immediate work
for me. I informed Abdulla Sheth of it. What, I thought, can be the
meaning of Mr. Baker’s interest in me ? What shall I gain from his
religious co-workers? How far  should  I undertake the study of
Christianity? How was I to obtain literature about Hinduism? And how
was I to understand Christianity in its proper perspective without
thoroughly knowing my own religion? I could come to only one
conclusion : I should make a dispassionate study of all that came to
me, and deal with Mr. Baker’s group as God might guide me; I should
not think of embracing another religion before I had fully understood
my own.</p>

The next day at one o’clock I went to Mr. Baker’s prayer-
meeting. There I was introduced to Miss Harris, Miss Gabb,  Mr.
Coates and others. Everyone kneeled down to pray, and I followed
suit. The prayers were supplications to God for various things,
according to each person’s desire. Thus the usual forms were for
the day to be passed peacefully, or for God to open the doors of the
heart.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A prayer was now added for my welfare : ‘Lord, show the path to the
new brother who has come amongst us. Give him, Lord, the peace that
Thou hast given us. May the Lord Jesus who has saved us save him too.
We ask all this in the name of Jesus.’ There was no singing of
hymns or other music at these meetings. After the supplication for
something special every day,  we  dispersed,  each going to his
lunch, that being the hour for it. The prayer did not take more than
five minutes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The Misses Harris and Gabb were both elderly maiden ladies. Mr.
Coates was a Quaker. The two ladies lived together, and they gave me
a standing invitation to four o‘clock tea at their house every
Sunday.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
When we met on Sundays, I used to give Mr. Coates  my religious diary
for the week, and discuss with him the books I had read and the
impression they had left on me. The ladies used to narrate their
sweet experiences and talk about the peace they had found.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Coates was a frank-hearted staunch young man<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>.
We went out for walks together, and he also took me to other
Christian friends.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
As we came closer to each other, he began to give me books of his own
choice, until my shelf was filled with them. He loaded me with books,
as it were. In pure faith I consented to read all those books, and as
I went on reading them we discussed them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I read a number of such books in 1893. I do not remember the names of
them all, but they included the <i>Commentary </i>of Dr. Parker of
the City Temple, Pearson’s <i>Many </i><i>Infallible </i><i>Proofs
</i>and Butler’s <i>Analogy</i>. Parts of these were unintelligible
to me. I liked some things in them, while I did not like others.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup><i>Man</i><i>y
</i><i> </i><i>Infallibl</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i> </i><i>Proofs </i><i>
</i>were proofs in support of the religion of the Bible, as the
author understood it. The book had no effect on me. Parker’s
<i>Commentary </i>was morally stimulating, but it could not be of any
help to one who had no faith in the prevalent Christian beliefs.
Butler’s <i>Analogy </i>struck me to be a very profound and
difficult book, which should be read four or five times to be
understood properly. It seemed to me to be written with a view to
converting atheists to theism. The arguments advanced in it regarding
the existence of God were unnecessary for me, as I had then passed
the stage of unbelief but the arguments in proof of Jesus being the
only incarnation of God and the Mediator between God and man left me
unmoved. But Mr. Coates was not the man easily to accept defeat. He
had great affection for me. He saw, round my neck, the Vaishnava
necklace of Tulasi-beads. He thought it to be superstition and was
pained by it. ‘This superstition does not become you. Come, let me
break the necklace.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0cm">
‘No, you will not. It is a sacred gift from my mother.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘But do you believe in it?’ ‘I do not know its myterious
signifi- cance. I do not think I should come to harm if I did not
wear it. But I cannot, without sufficient reason, give up a necklace
that  she  put round my neck out of love and in the conviction that
it would be conducive to my welfare. When, with the passage of time,
it wears away and breaks on its own accord, I shall have no desire to
get a new one. But this necklace cannot be broken.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Mr. Coates could not appreciate my argument, as he had no regard for
my religion. He was looking forward to delivering me from the abyss
of ignorance. He wanted to convince me that, no matter whether there
was some truth in other religions, salvation was impossible for me
unless I accepted Christianity which represented the truth, and that
my sins would not be washed away except by the intercession of Jesus,
and that all good works were useless.</p>

Just as he introduced me to several books, he introduced me to
several friends whom he regarded as staunch Christians. One of these
introductions was to a family which belonged to the Plymouth
Brethren, a Christian sect.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Many of the contacts for which Mr. Coates was responsible were good.
Most struck me as being God-fearing. But during my contact with this
family, one of the Plymouth Brethren confronted me with an argument
for which I was not prepared :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You cannot understand the beauty of our religion. From what you
say it appears that you must be brooding over your transgressions
every moment of your life, always mending them and atoning for them.
How can this ceaseless cycle of action bring you redemption ? You can
never have peace. You admit that we are all sinners. Now look at the
perfection of our belief. Our attempts at improvement and atonement
are futile. And yet redemption we must have. How can we bear the
burden of sin ? We can but throw it on Jesus. He is the only sinless
Son of God. It is His word that those who believe in Him shall have
everlasting life.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Therein lies God’s infinite mercy. And as we believe
in the atonement of Jesus, our own sins do not bind us. Sin we
must.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>It is impossible to live in this world sinless. And
therefore Jesus suffered and atoned for all the sins of mankind. Only
he who accepts His great redemption<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>can have eternal peace. Think what a life of
restlessness is yours, and what a promise of peace we have.’</p>

The argument utterly failed to convince me. I humbly replied : ‘If
this be the Christianity  acknowledged  by  all  Christians,  I</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.37cm">
cannot accept it. I do not seek redemption<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

restless.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
To which the Plymouth Brother rejoined : ‘I assure you, your
attempt is fruitless. Think again over what I have said.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And the Brother proved as good as his word He knowingly committed
transgressions, and showed me that he was undisturbed by the thought
of them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I already knew before meeting with these friends that all
Christians did not believe in such a theory of atonement. Mr. Coates
himself walked in the fear of God. His heart was pure, and he
believed in the possibility of self-purification. The two ladies also
shared this belief. Some of the books that came into my hands were
full of devotion. So, although Mr. Coates was very much disturbed by
this latest experience of mine, I was able to reassure him and tell
him that</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
the distorted belief of a Plymouth Brother could not prejudice me
against Christianity.</p>

Before writing further about Christian contacts, I must record other
experiences of the same period.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad had in Pretoria the same position as
was enjoyed by Dada Abdulla in Natal. There was no public movement
that could be conducted without him. I made his acquaintance the very
first week and told him of my intention to get in touch with every
Indian in Pretoria. I expressed a desire to study the conditions of
Indians there, and asked for his help in my work, which he gladly
agreed to give.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
My first step was to call a meeting of all the Indians in Pretoria
and to present to them a picture of their condition in the Transvaal.
The meeting was held at the house of Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Joosab,
to whom I had a letter of introduction. It was principally attended
by Meman merchants, though there was a sprinkling of Hindus as well.
The Hindu population in Pretoria was, as a matter of fact, very
small.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
My speech at this meeting may be said to have been the first public
speech in my life. I went fairly prepared with my subject, which was
about observing truthfulness in business. I had always heard the
merchants say that truth was not possible in business. I did not
think so then, nor do I now. Even today there are merchant friends
who contend that truth is inconsistent with business. Business they
say, is a very practical affair, and truth a matter of religion; and
they argue that practical affairs are one thing, while religion is
quite another. Pure truth, they hold, is out of the question in
business; one can speak it only so far as is suitable. I strongly
contested the position in my speech and awakened the merchants to a
sense of their duty, which was twofold. Their responsibility to be
truthful was all the greater in a foreign land, because the conduct
of a few Indians was the measure of that of the millions of their
fellowcountrymen.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I had found our people’s habits to be insanitary, as compared with
those of the Englishmen around them, and drew their attention to it.
I laid stress on the necessity of forgetting all distinctions such as
Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,
Punjabis, Sindhis, Kachchhis, Surtis and so on.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
I suggested, in conclusion, the formation of an association to make
representations to the authorities concerned in respect of the
hardships of the Indian settlers, and offered to place at its
disposal as much of my time and service as was possible.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
I saw that I made a considerable impression on the meeting.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My speech was followed by discussion. Some offered to supply me with
facts. I felt encouraged. I saw that very few amongst my audience
knew English. As I felt that knowledge of English would be useful in
that country, I adviced those who had leisure  to  learn English. I
told them that it was possible to learn language even at an advanced
age, and cited cases of people who had  done  so.  I undertook,
besides, to teach a class, if one was started or personally to
instruct individuals desiring to learn the language.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The class was not started, but three young men expressed their
readiness to learn at their convenience, and on condition that I went
to their places to teach them. Of these, two were Mussalmans— one
of them a barber and the other a clerk—and the third was a Hindu, a
petty shopkeeper. I agreed to suit them all. I had no mis- givings
regarding my capacity to teach. My pupils might become tired, but not
I. Sometimes it happened that I would go to their places only to find
them engaged in their business. But I did not lose patience. None of
the three desired a deep study of English, but two may be said to
have made fairly good progress in about eight months. Two learnt
enough to keep accounts and write ordinary business letters. The
barber’s ambition was confined to acquiring just enough English for
dealing with his customers. As a result of their studies, two of the
pupils were equipped for making a fair income.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I was satisfied with the result of the meeting. It was decided to
hold such meetings, as far as I remember, once as week or, may be,
once a month. These were held more or less regularly, and on these
occasions there was a free exchange of ideas. The result was that
there was now in Pretoria no Indian I did not know, or whose
condition I was not acquainted with. This prompted me in turn to make
the acquaintance of the British Agent in Pretoria, Mr. Jacobus de
Wet. He had sympathy for the Indians, but he had very little
influence. However, he agreed to help us as best he could, and
invited me to meet him whenever I wished.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I now communicated with the railway authorities and told them that,
even under their own regulations, the disabilities about travelling
under which the Indians laboured could not be justified. I got a
letter in reply to the effect that first and second class tickets
would be issued to Indians who were properly dressed. This was far
from giving</p>

adequate relief, as it rested with the Station Master to decide who
was ‘properly dressed’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The British Agent showed me some papers dealing with Indian affairs.
Tyeb Sheth had also given me similar papers. I learnt from them how
cruelly the Indians were hounded out from the Orange Free State.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
In short, my stay in Pretoria enabled me to make a deep study of the
social, economical and political condition of the Indians in the
Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I had no idea that this study
was to be of invaluable service to me in the future. For I had
thought of returning home by the end of the year, or even earlier, if
the case was finished before the year was out.</p>

It would be out of place here to describe fully the condition of
Indians in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State. I would suggest
that those who wish to have a full idea of it may turn to my <i>History
of Satyagraha in South Africa</i>. It is, however, necessary to give
here a brief outline.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In the Orange Free State the Indians were deprived of all their
rights by a special law enacted inn 1888 or even earlier. If they
chose to stay there, they could do so only to serve as waiters in
hotels or to pursue some other such menial calling. The traders were
driven away with a nominal compensation. They made representations
and petitions, but in vain.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A very stringent enactment was passed in the Transvaal in 1885. It
was slightly amended in 1886, and it was provided under the amended
law that all Indians should pay a poll-tax of £3 as fee for entry
into the Transvaal. They might not own land except in locations set
apart for them, and in practice even that was not to be ownership.
They had no franchise. All this was under the special law for
Asiatics, to whom the laws for the coloured people were also applied.
Under these latter, Indians might not walk on public footpaths, and
might not move out of doors after 9 p.m. without a permit. The
enforcement of this last regulation was elastic so far as the Indians
were concerned. Those who passed as ‘Arabs’ were, as a matter of
favour, exempted from it. The exemption thus naturally depended on
the sweet will of the police.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I had to experience the effect of both these regulations. I often
went out at night for a walk with Mr. Coates, and we rarely got back
home much before ten o’clock. What if the police arrested me ? Mr.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Coates was more concerned about this than I. He had to issue passes
to his Negro servants. But how could he give one to me ? Only a
master might issue a permit to a servant. If I had wanted one, and
even if Mr. Coates had been ready to give it, he could not have done
so, for it would have been fraud.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
So Mr. Coates or some friend of his took me to the State Attorney,
Dr. Krause. We turned out to be barristers of the same Inn. The fact
that I needed a pass to enable me to be out of doors after 9</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 102%">
p.m. was too much for him. He expressed sympathy for me. Instead of
ordering for me a pass, he gave me a letter authorizing me to be out
of doors at all hours without police interference. I always kept this
letter on me whenever I went out. The fact that I never had to make
use of it was a mere accident.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Krause invited me to his place, and we may be said to have become
friends. I occasionally called on him, and it was through him that I
was introduced to his more famous brother, who was Public Prosecutor
in Johannesburg. During the Boer War he was court- martialled for
conspiring to murder an English officer, and was sentenced to
imprisonment for seven years. He was also disbarred by the Benchers.
On the termination of hostilities he was released and, being
honourably readmitted to the Transvaal bar, resumed practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These connections were useful to me later on in my public life, and
simplified much of my work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
The consequences of the regulation regarding the use of footpaths
were rather serious for me. I always went out for a walk through
President Street to an open plain. President Kruger’s house was in
this street—a very modest, unostentatious building, without a
garden, and not distinguishable from other houses in its neighbo-
urhood. The houses of many of the millionaires in Pretoria were far
more pretentious, and were surrounded by gardens. Indeed President
Kruger’s simplicity was proverbial. Only the presence of a police
patrol before the house indicated that it belonged to some official.
I nearly always went along the footpath past this patrol without the
slightest hitch or hindrance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now the man on duty used to be changed from time to time. Once one of
these men, without giving me the slightest warning, without even
asking me to leave the footpath, pushed and kicked me into the
street. I was dismayed. Before I could question him as to his
behaviour, Mr. Coates, who happened to be passing the spot on horse
back, hailed me and said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
‘Gandhi, I have seen everything. I shall gladly be your witness in
court if you proceed against the man. I am very sorry you have been
so rudely assaulted.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘You need not be sorry,’ I said. ‘What does the  poor  man 
know ? All coloured people are the same to him. He no doubt treats
Negroes just as he has treated me. I have made it a rule not to go to
court in respect of any personal grievance. So I do not intend to
proceed against him.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘That is just like you,’ said Mr. Coates, ‘but do think it over
again. We must teach such men a lesson.’ He then spoke to the
policeman and reprimanded him. I could not follow their talk, as it
was in Dutch, the policeman being a Boer. But he apologized to me,
for which there was no need. I had already forgiven him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I never again went through this street. There would be other men
coming in this man’s place and, ignorant of the incident, they
would behave likewise. Why should I unnecessarily court another kick</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.43cm">
? I therefore selected a different walk.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The incident deepened my feeling for the Indian settlers. I discussed

I thus made an intimate study of the hard condition of the Indian
settlers, not only by reading and hearing about it, but by personal
experience. I saw that South Africa was no country for a self-
respecting Indian, and my mind became more and more occupied with the
question as to how this state of things might be improved.</p>

The year’s stay in Pretoria was a most valuable experience in my
life. Here it was that I had opportunities of learning public work
and acquired some measure of my capacity for it. Here it was that the
religious spirit within me became a living force, and here too I 
acquired a true knowledge of legal practice. Here I learnt the things
that a junior barrister learns in a senior barrister’s chamber, and
here I also gained confidence that I should not after all fail as a
lawyer. It was likewise here that I learnt the secret of success as a
lawyer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dada Abdulla’s was no small case. The suit was for £40,000.
Arising out of business transactions, it was full of intricacies of
accounts. Part of the claim was based on promissory notes, and part
on the specific performance of promise to deliver promissory notes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
The defence was that the promissory notes were fraudulently taken and
lacked sufficient consideration. There were numerous points of fact
and law<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>in this intricate case.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Both parties had engaged the best attorneys and counsel. I thus had a
fine opportunity of studying their work. The preparation of the
plaintiff’s case for the attorney and the sifting of facts in
support of his case had been entrusted to me. It was an education to
see how much the attorney accepted, and how much he rejected from my
preparation, as also to see have much use the counsel made of the
brief prepared by the attorney. I saw that this preparation for the
case would give me a fair measure of my powers of comprehension and
my capacity for marshalling evidence.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I took the keenest interest in the case. Indeed I threw myself into
it. I read all the papers pertaining to the transactions. My client
was a man of great ability and reposed absolute confidence in me, and
this rendered my work easy. I made a fair study of book-keeping. My
capacity for translation was improved by having to translate the
correspondence, which was for the most part in Gujarati.</p>

<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>Although,

in public work and always gave some of my time to them, they were not
then my primary interest. The prep- aration of the case was my
primary interest. Reading of law and looking up law cases, when
necessary, had always a prior claim on my time. As a result, I
acquired such a grasp of the facts of the case as perhaps was not
possessed even by the parties themselves, inasmuch as   I had with me
the papers of both the parties.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I recalled the late Mr. Pincott’s advice—facts are three-fourths
of the law. At a later date it was amply borne out by that famous
barrister of South Africa, the late Mr. Leonard. In a certain case in
my charge I saw that, though justice was on the side of my client,
the law seemed to be against him. In despair I approached Mr. Leonard
for help. He also felt that the facts of the case were very strong.
He exclaimed, ‘Gandhi, I have learnt one thing, and it is this,
that if we take care of the facts of a case, the law will take care
of itself. Let us dive deeper into the facts of this case.’ With
these words he asked me to study the case further and then see him
again. On a re-examination of the facts I saw them in an entirely new
light, and I also hit upon an old South African case bearing on the
point. I was delighted and went to Mr. Leonard and told him
everything. ‘Right,’ he said, ‘we shall win the case. Only we
must bear in mind which of the judges takes it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
When I was making preparation for Dada Abdulla’s case, I had not
fully realized this  paramount  importance  of  facts.   Facts  mean</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
truth, and once we adhere to truth, the law comes to our aid
naturally.  I saw that the facts of Dada Abdulla’s case made it
very strong indeed, and that the law was bound to be on his side. But
I also saw that the litigation, if it were parsisted in, would ruin
the plaintiff and the defendant, who were relatives and both belonged
to the same city. No one knew how long the case might go on. Should
it be allowed to continue to be fought out in court, it might go on
indefinitely and to no advantage of either party.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Both,
therefore, desired an immediate termination of the case, if possible.</p>

I approached Tyeb Sheth and requested and advised him to go to
arbitration. I recommended him to see his counsel. I suggested to him
that if an arbitrator commanding the confidence of both par-ties
could be appointed, the case would be quickly finished. The lawy-ers’
fees were so rapidly mounting up that they were enough to devo-ur all
the resources of the clients, big merchants as they were. The case
occupied so much of their attention that they had no time left for
any other work. In the mean-time mutual ill-will was steadily
increasing. I became disgusted with the profession. As lawyers the
counsel on both sides were bound to rake up points of law in support
of their own clients. I also saw for the first time that the winning
party never recovers all the costs incurred. Under the Court Fees
Regulation there was a fixed scale of costs to be allowed as between
party and party, the actual costs as between attorney and client
being very much higher. This was more than I could bear. I felt that
my duty was to befriend both parties and bring them together. I
strained every nerve to bring about a compromise. At last Tyeb Sheth
agreed. An arbitrator was appointed, the case was argued before him,
and Dada Abdulla won.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But that did not satisfy me. If my client were to seek immediate
execution of the award, it would be impossible for Tyeb Sheth to meet
the whole of the awarded amount, and there was an unwritten law among
the Porbandar Memans living in South Africa  that  death should be
preferred to bankruptcy. It was impossible for Tyeb Sheth to pay down
the whole sum of about £ 37,000 and costs. He meant to pay not a pie
less than the amount, and he did not want to be declared bankrupt.
There was only one way, Dada Abdulla should allow him to pay in  
moderate  instalments.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>He
 was  equal  to  the  occasion,  and granted Tyeb Sheth instalments
spread over a very long period. It was more difficult for me to
secure this concession of payment by instalments than to get the
parties to agree to arbitration. But both were happy over the result,
and both rose in the public estimation. My joy was boundless. I had
learnt the true practice of law. I had learnt to find out the better
side of human nature and to enter men’s hearts. I realized that the
true function of a lawyer was to unite parties riven</p>

asunder. The lesson was so indelibly burnt into me that a large part
of my time during the twenty years of my practice as a lawyer was
occupied in bringing about private compromises of hundreds of cases.
I lost nothing thereby—not even money, certainly not my soul.</p>

It is now time to turn again to my experiences with Christian
friends.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Mr. Baker was getting anxious about my future. He took me to the
Wellington Convention. The Protestant Christians organize such
gatherings every few years for religious enlightenment or, in other
words, self-purification. One may call this religion restoration or
revival. The Wellington Convention was of this type. The chairman was
the famous divine of the place, the Rev. Andrew Murray. Mr. Baker had
hoped that the atmosphere of religious exaltation at the Convention,
and the enthusiasm and earnestness of the people atte- nding it,
would inevitably lead me to embrace Christianity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
But his final hope was the efficacy of prayer. He had an abiding
faith in prayer. It was his firm conviction that God could not but
listen to prayer fervently offered. He would cite the instances of
men like George Muller of Bristol, who depended entirely on prayer
even for his temporal needs. I listened to his discourse on the
efficacy  of prayer with unbiased attention, and assured him that
nothing could prevent me from embracing Christianity, should I feel
the call. I had no hesitation in giving him this assurance, as<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
had long since taught myself to follow the inner voice. I delighted
in submitting to it. To act against it would be difficult and painful
to me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
So we went to Wellington. Mr. Baker was hard put to it in having ‘a
coloured man’ like me for his companion. He had to suffer
inconveniences on many occasions entirely on account of me. We had to
break the journey on the way, as one of the days happened to be a
Sunday, and Mr. Baker and his party would not travel on the sabbath.
Though the mannager of the station hotel agreed to take me in after
much altercation, he absolutely refused to admit me to the dining-
room. Mr. Baker was not the man to give way easily. He stood by the
rights of the guests of a hotel. But I could see his difficulty. At
Wellington also I stayed with Mr. Baker. In spite of his best efforts
to conceal the little inconveniences that he was put to, I could see
them all.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
This Convention was an assemblage of devout Christians. I was
delighted at their faith. I met the Rev. Murray. I saw that many were
praying for me. I liked some of their hymns, they were very sweet.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The Convention lasted for three days. I could understand and
appreciate the devoutness of those who attended it. But I saw  no
reason for changing my belief—my religion. It was impossible for me
to believe that I could go to heaven or attain salvation only by
becoming<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>a
Christian. When I frankly said so to some of the good Christian
friends, they were shocked. But there was no help for it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
My difficulties lay deeper. It was more than I could believe that
Jesus was the only incarnate son of God, and that only  he  who
believed in him would have everlasting life. If God could have sons,
all of us were His sons. If Jesus was like God, or God Himself, then
all men were like God and could be God Himself<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>.
My reason was not ready to believe literally that Jesus by his death
and by his blood redeemed the sins of the world. Metaphorically there
might be some truth in it. Again, according to Christianity<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>only
human beings had souls, and not other living beings, for whom death
meant complete extinction; while I held a contrary belief. I could
accept Jesus as a martyr, an embodiment of sacrifice<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>,
and a divine teacher, but not as the most perfect man ever born<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>.
His death on the Cross was a great example to the world, but that
there was anything like a mysterious or miraculous virtue in it my
heart could not accept. The pious lives of Christians did not give me
anything that the lives of men of other faiths had failed to give. I
had seen in other lives just the same ref- ormation that I had heard
of among Christians. Philosophically there was nothing extraordinary
in Christian principles. From the point of view of sacrifice<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7</font></sup>,
it seemed to me that the Hindus greatly surpassed the Christians. It
was impossible for me to regard Christianity as a perfect religion or
the greatest of all religions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
I shared this mental churning with my Christian friends when ever
there was an opportunity, but their answers could not satisfy me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the
greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being
such. Hindu defects were pressingly visible to me. If untouchability
could be a part of Hinduism, it could but be a rotten part or an
excrescence. I could not understand the <i>raison d’etre </i>of a
multitude of sects and castes. What was the meaning of saying that
the Vedas were the inspired Word of God ? If they were inspired, why
not also the Bible and the Koran ?</p>

As Christian friends were endeavouring to convert me, even so were
Mussalman friends. Abdulla Sheth had kept on inducing me to study
Islam, and of course he had always something to say regarding its
beauty.</p>

I expressed my difficulties in a letter to Raychandbhai.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
 also corresponded with other religious authorities in India and
received answers from them. Raychandbhai’s letter somewhat pacified
me. He asked me to be patient and to study Hinduism more deeply. One
of his sentences was to this effect: ‘On a dispassionate view of
the question I am convinced that no other religion has the subtle and
profound thought of Hinduism, its vision of the soul, or its
charity.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I purchased Sales’s translation of the Koran and began reading it.
I also obtained other books on Islam. I communicated  with Christian
friends in England. One of them introduced me to Edward Maitland<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>with
 whom  I  opened  correspondence.  He   sent   me   <i>The Perfect
</i><i>Way</i>, a book he had written in collaboration with Anna
Kingsford. The book was a repudiation of the current Christian
belief. He also sent me another book, <i>The New </i><i>Interpretation
</i><i>of </i><i>the </i><i>Bible</i>. I liked both. They seemed to
support Hinduism. Tolstoy’s  <i>The </i><i>Kingdom </i><i>of </i><i>God
</i><i>Is </i><i>within </i><i>You </i>overwhelmed me. It left an
abiding impression on me. Before the independent thinking, profound
morality, and the truthfulness of this book, all the books given me
by Mr. Coates seemed to pale into insignificance.</p>

It was proposed to spend the whole day there. Whilst I was turning

see a paragraph in a corner of one of them under the caption ‘Indian

This opened my eyes. I felt that this class should be claimed as our
own. Was this the meaning of Christianity ? Did they cease to be
Indians because they had become Christians ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I was on the point of returning home and hesitated  to express
what was passing through my mind in this matter. I simply said to
Abdulla Sheth : ‘This Bill, if it passes into law, will make our<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>lot extremely difficult. It is the first nail into our
coffin. It strikes at the root of our self-respect.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It may,’ echoed Sheth Abdulla. ‘I will tell you the genesis of
the franchise question<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>.
We know nothing about it. But Mr. Escombe, one of our best attorneys,
whom you know, put the idea into our heads. It happened thus. He is a
great fighter, and there being no love lost between him and the Wharf
Engineer, he feared that the Engineer might deprive him of his votes
and defeat him at the election. So he acquainted us with our
position, and at his instance we all registered ourselves as voters,
and voted for him. You will now see how the franchise has not for us
the value that you attach to it. But we  understand what you say.
Well, then, what is your advice ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
The other guests were listening to this conversation with attention.
One of them said : ‘Shall I tell you what should be done ? You
cancel your passage by this boat, stay here a month longer, and we
will fight as you direct us.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
All the others chimed in : ‘Indeed, indeed. Abdulla Sheth, you must
detain Gandhibhai.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Sheth was a shrewd man. He said : ‘I may not detain him now. Or
rather, you have as much right as I to do so. But you are quite
right. Let us <i>all </i>persuade him to stay on. But you should
remember that he is a barrister. What about his fees ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The mention of fees pained me, and I broke in : ‘Abdulla Sheth,
fees are out of the question. There can be no fees for public work. I
can stay, if at all, as a servant. And as you know, I am not
acquainted with all these friends. But if you believe that they will
co-operate, I am prepared to stay a month longer. There is one thing,
however. Though you need not pay me anything, work of the nature we
contemplate cannot be done without some funds to start with. Thus we
may have to send telegrams, we may have to print some literature,
some touring may have to be done, the local attorneys may have to be
consulted, and as I am ignorant of your laws, I may need some
law-books for reference. All this cannot be done without money. And
it is clear that one man is not enough for this work. Many must come
forward to help him.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
And a chorus of voices was heard: ‘Allah is great and merciful.
Money will come in. Men there are, as many as you need. You please
consent to stay, and all will be well.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The farewell party was thus turned into a working committee. I
suggested finishing dinner, etc., quickly and getting back home. I
worked out in my own mind an outline of the campaign. I ascertained
the names of those who were on the list of voters, and made up my
mind to stay on for a month.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus God laid the foundations of my life<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Sheth Haji Muhammad Haji Dada was regarded as the foremost leader of
the Indian community in Natal in 1893. Financially Sheth Abdulla Haji
Adam was the chief among them, but he and others always gave the
first place to Sheth Haji Muhammad in public affairs. A meeting was,
therefore, held under his presidentship at the house of Abdulla
Sheth, at which it was resolved to offer opposition to the Franchise
Bill.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Volunteers were enrolled. Natal-born Indians, that is, mostly
Christian Indian youths, had been invited to attend this meeting. Mr.
Paul, the Durban Court Interpreter, and Mr. Subhan Godfrey, Head
Master of a mission school, were present, and it was they who were
responsible for bringing together at the meeting a good number of
Christian youths. All these enrolled themselves as volunteers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Many of the local merchants were of course enrolled, note worthy
among them being Sheths Dawud Muhammad, Muhammad Kasam Kamruddin,
Adamji Miyakhan, A. Kolandavellu Pillai, C. Lachhiram, Rangasami
Padiachi, and Amad Jiva. Parsi Rustomji was of course there. From
among the clerks were Messrs Manekji, Joshi, Narsinhram and others,
employees of Dada Abdulla and  Co.  and other big firms. They were
all agreeably surprised to find themselves taking a share in public
work. To be invited thus to take part was a new experience in their
lives. In face of the calamity that had overtaken the community, all
distinctions such as high and low, small and great, master and
servant, Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians, Gujaratis, Madrasis,
Sindhis, etc., were forgotten. All were alike the children and
servants of the motherland.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The Bill had already passed, or was about to pass, its second
reading. In the speeches on the occasion the fact that Indians had
expressed no opposition to the stringent Bill was urged as proof of
their<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>unfitness for the franchise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
I explained the situation to the meeting. The first thing we did was
to despatch a telegram to the Speaker of the Assembly requesting him
to postpone further discussion of the Bill. A similar telegram was
sent to the Premier, Sir John Robinson, and another to Mr. Escombe,
as a friend of Dada Abdulla’s. The Speaker promptly replied that
discussion of the Bill would be postponed for two days. This 
gladdened our hearts.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The petition<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

up.  Three  copies  had  to  be  prepared<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
 one   extra   was needed for the Press. It was also proposed to
obtain as many signatures to it as possible, and all this work had to
be done in the course of a night. The volunteers with a knowledge of
English and several others sat up the whole night. Mr. Arthur, an old
man, who was known for his calligraphy, wrote the principal copy. The
rest were written by others to someone’s dictation. Five copies
were thus got ready simultaneously. Merchant volunteers went out in
their own carriages, or carriages whose hire they had paid, to obtain
signatures</p>

to the petition. This was accomplished in quick time and the petition
was despatched. The newspapers published it with favourable comments.
It likewise created an impression on the Assembly. It was discussed<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>in the House. Partisans of the Bill offered a defence,
an admittedly lame one, in reply to the arguments advanced  in  the
petition. The Bill, however, was passed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
We all knew that this was a foregone conclusion, but the agitation
had infused new life into the community and had brought home to them
the conviction that the community was one and indivisible, and that
it was as much their duty to fight for its political rights as for
its trading rights.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Lord Ripon was at this time Secretary of State for the Colonies. It
was decided to submit to him a monster petition. This was no small
task and could not be done in a day. Vlunteers were enlisted, and all
did their due share of the work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
I took considerable pains over drawing up this petition<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>.
I read all the literature available on the subject. My argument
centred round a principle and an expedience. I argued that we had a
right to the franchise in Natal, as we had a kind of franchise in
India. I urged that it was expedient to retain it, as the Indian
population capable of using the franchise was very small.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
Ten thousand signatures were obtained in the course of a fortnight.
To secure this number of signatures from the whole of the province
was no light task, especially when we consider that the men were
perfect strangers to the work. Specially competent volunteers had to
be selected for the work, as it had been decided not to take a single
signature without the signatory fully understanding the petition. The
villages were scattered at long distances. The work could be done
promptly only if a number of workers put their whole heart into it.
And this they did. All carried out their allotted task with
enthusiasm. But as I am writing these lines, the figures of Sheth
Dawud Muhammad, Rustomji, Adamji Miyakhan, and Amad Jiva rise clearly
before my mind. They brought in the largest number of signatures.
Dawud Sheth kept going about in his carriage the whole day. And it
was all a labour of love, not one of them asking for even his out-of-
pocket expenses. Dada Abdulla’s house became at once a 
caravanserai and a public office. A number of educated friends who
helped me and many others had their food there. Thus every helper was
put to considerable expense.</p>

The petition was at last submitted. A thousand copies had been
printed for circulation and distribution. It acquainted the Indian 
public for the first time with conditions in Natal. I sent copies to
all the newspapers and publicists<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup>The  London <i>Times </i>supported our claims, and
we began to entertain hopes of the Bill being vetoed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It was now impossible for me to leave Natal. The Indian friends
surrounded me on all sides and importuned me to remain there
permanently. I expressed my difficulties. I had made up my mind not
to stay at public expense. I felt it necessary to set up an
independent household. I thought<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>that the house should be good and situated in a good
locality. I also had the idea that I could not add to the credit of
the community, unless I lived in a style usual for barristers. And it
seemed to me to be impossible to run such a household with anything
less than £300 a year. I therefore decided that I could stay only if
the members of the community guaranteed legal work to the extent of
that minimum, and I communicated my decision to them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But’, said they, ‘we should like you to draw<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>that amount for public work, and we can easily collect
it. Of course this is apart from the fees you must charge for private
legal work.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘No, I could not thus charge you for public work,’ said I.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>‘The work would not involve the exercise on my part
of much skill as barrister. My work would be mainly to make you all
work. And how could I charge you for that? And then I should have to
appeal to you frequently for funds for the work, and if I were to
draw my mainte- nance from you, I should find myself at a
disadvantage in making an appeal for large amounts, and we should
ultimately find ourselves at a standstill. Besides I want the
community to find more than £300 annually for public work.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But we have now known you for some time, and are sure you would
not draw anything you do not need. And if we wanted you to stay here,
should we not find your expenses ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is your love and present enthusiasm that make you talk like
this. How can we be sure that this love and enthusisam will endure
for ever ? And as your friend and servant,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I should occasionally have to say hard things to you.
Heaven only knows whether I should then retain your affection. But
the fact is that I must not accept any salary for public work. It is
enough for me that you should all agree to</p>

entrust me with your legal work. Even that may be hard for you. For
one thing I am not a white barrister. How can I be sure that the
court will respond to me ? Nor can I be sure how I shall fare as a
lawyer. So even in giving me retainers you may be running some risk.
I should regard even the fact of your giving them to me as the reward
of my public work.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The upshot of this discussion was that about twenty merchants gave me
retainers for one year for their legal work. Besides this, Dada
Abdulla purchased me the necessary furniture in lieu of a purse he
had intended to give me on my departure.</p>

The symbol of a court of justice is a pair of scales held evenly by
an impartial and blind but sagacious woman. Fate has purposely made
her blind, in order that she may not judge a person from his exterior
but from his intrinsic worth. But the Law Society of Natal set out to
persuade the Supreme Court to act in contravention of this principle
and to belie its symbol.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I applied for admission as an advocate of the Supreme Court. I held a
certificate of admission from the Bombay High Court. The English
certificate I had to deposit with the Bombay High Court when I was
enrolled there. It was necessary to attach two certificates of
character to the application for admission, and thinking that these
would carry more weight if given by Europeans, I secured them from
two well-known European merchants whom I knew through Sheth Abdulla.
The application had to be presented through a member of the bar, and
as a rule the Attorney General presented such applications without
fees. Mr. Escombe, who, as we have seen, was legal adviser to Messrs
Dada Abdulla &amp; Co., was the Attorney General. I called on him,
and he willingly consented to present my application.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The Law Society now sprang a surprise on me by serving me with a
notice opposing my application for admission. One of their objections
was that the original English certificate was not attached to my
application. But the main objection was that, when the regulations
regarding admission of advocates were made, the possibility of a
coloured man applying could not have been contemplated. Natal owed
its growth to European enterprise, and therefore in the bar. If
coloured people were admitted, they might gradually outnumber the
Europeans, and the bulwark of their protection would break down.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Law Society had engaged a distinguished lawyer to support their
opposition. As he too was connected with Dada Abdulla &amp; Co.,</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
he sent me word through Sheth abdulla to go and see him. He talked
with me quite frankly, and inquired about my antecedents, which I
gave. Then he said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘I have nothing to say against you. I was only afraid lest you
should be some Colonial-born adventurer. And the fact that your
application was unaccompanied by the original certificate supported
my suspicion. There have been men who have made use of diplomas which
did not belong to them. The certificate of character from European
traders you have submitted have no value for me. What do they know
about you ? What can be the extent of their acquaintance with you ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
‘But’, said I, ‘everyone here is a stranger to me. Even Sheth
Abdulla first came to know me here.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But then you say he belongs to the same place as you ? If your
father was Prime Minister there, Sheth Abdulla is bound to know your
family. If you were to produce his affidavit, I should have
absolutely no objection. I would then gladly communicate to the Law
Society my inability to oppose your application.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This talk enraged me, but I restrained my feelings. ‘If I had
attached Dada Abdulla’s certificate,‘ said I to myself, ‘it
would have been rejected and they would have asked for Europeans’
certificates. And what has my admission as advocate to do with my
birth and my antecedents ? How could my birth, whether humble or
objectionable, be used against me ?’ But I contained myself and
quietly replied :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘Though I do not admit that the Law Society has any authority to
require all these details, I am quite prepared to present the
affidavit you desire.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Sheth Abdulla’s affidavit was prepared and duly submitted to the
counsel for the Law Society. He said he was satisfied. But not so the
Law Society. It opposed my application before  the  Supreme Court,
which ruled out the opposition without even calling upon Mr. Escombe
to reply. The Chief Justice said in effect :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The objection that the applicant has not attached the original
certificate has no substance. If he has made a false affidavit, he
can be prosecuted, and his name can then be struck off the roll, if
he is proved  guilty.  The  law<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>makes  no  distinction  between   white  and
coloured people. The Court has therefore no authority to prevent Mr.
Gandhi from being enrolled as an advocate. We admit his application.
Mr. Gandhi, you can now take the oath.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I stood up and took the oath before the Registrar. As soon as I was
sworn in, the Chief Justice, addressing me, said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
‘You must now take off your turban, Mr. Gandhi. You must submit to
the rules of the Court with regard to the dress to be worn by
practising barristers.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I saw my limitations. The turban that I had insisted on wearing in
the district Magistrate Court I took off in obedience to the order of
the Supreme Court. Not that, if I had resisted the order, the
resistance could not have been justified. But I wanted to reserve my
strength for fighting bigger battles. I should not exhaust my skill
as a fighter in insisting on retaining my turban. It was worthy of a
better cause.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Sheth Abdulla and other friends did not like my submission (or was it
weakness ?). They felt that I should have stood by my right to wear
the turban while practising in the Court. I tried to reason with
them. I tried to press home to them the truth of the maxim, ‘When
at Rome do as the Romans do.’ ‘It would be right,’ I said, ‘to
refuse to obey, if in India an English officer or judge ordered you
to take off your turban; but as an officer of the Court, it would
have ill become me to disregard a custom of the Court in the province
of Natal.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I pacified the friends somewhat with these and similar arguments, but
I do not think I convinced them completely; in this instance, of the
applicability of the principle of looking at a thing from a different
standpoint in different circumstances. But all my life through, the
very insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the beauty of
compromise.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The opposition of the Law Society gave me another advertisement in
South Africa. Most of the newspapers condemned the opposition and
accused the Law Society of jealousy. The advertisement, to some
extent, simplified my work.</p>

Practice as a lawyer was and remained for me a subordinate
occupation. It was necessary that I should concentrate on public work
to justify my stay in Natal. The despatch of the petition regarding
the disfranchising bill was not sufficient in itself. Sustained
agitation was essential for making an impression on the Secretary of
State for the Colonies. For this purpose it was thought necessary to
bring  into being a permanent organization. So I consulted Sheth
Abdulla and other friends, and we all decided to have a public
organization of a permanent character.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
To find out a name to be given to the new organization per- plexed me
sorely. It was not to identify itself with any particular party. The
name ‘Congress’, I knew, was in bad odour with the Conserva-
tives in England, and yet the Congress was the very life of India. I
wanted to popularize it in Natal. It savoured of cowardice to
hesitate to adopt the name. Therefore, with full explanation of my
reasons, I recommended that the organization should be called the
Natal Indian Congress, and on the 22nd May the Natal Indian Congress
came into being.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dada Abdulla’s spacious room was packed to the full on that day.
The Congress received the enthusiastic approval of all present. Its
constitution<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was simple, the subscription was heavy. Only he who paid
five shillings monthly could be a member. The well-to-do classes were
persuaded to subscribe as much as they could. Abdualla Sheth headed
the list with £2 per month. Two other friends also put down the
same. I thought I should not stint my subscription, and put down a
pound per month. This was for me no small amount. But I thought that
it would not be beyond my means, if at all I was to pay my way. And
God helped me. We thus got a considerable number of members who
subscribed £1 per month. The number of those who put down 10s. was
even larger. Besides this, there were donations which were gratefully
accepted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Experience showed that no one paid his subscription for the mere
asking. It was impossible to call frequently on members outside
Durban. The enthusiasm of one moment seemed to wear away the next.
Even the members in Durban had to be considerably dunned before they
would pay in their subscriptions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The task of collecting subcriptions lay with me, I being the
secretary. And we came to a stage when I had to keep my clerk enga-
ged all day long in the work of collection. The man got tired of the
job, and I felt that, if the situation was to be  improved,  the
subscriptions should be made payable annually and not monthly, and
that too strictly in advance. So I called a meeting of the Congress.
Everyone welcomed the proposal for making the subscription annual
instead of monthly and for fixing the minimum at £3. Thus the work
of collection was considerably facilitated.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had learnt at the outset not to carry on public work with borrowed
money. One could rely on people’s promises in  most matters except
in repsect of money. I had never found people quick</p>

to pay the amounts they had undertaken to subscribe, and the Natal
Indians were no exception to the rule. As, therefore, no work was
done unless there were funds on hand, the Natal Indian Congress has
never been in debt.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My co-workers evinced extraordinary enthusiasm in canvassing members.
It was work which interested them and was at the same time an
invaluable experience. Large numbers of people gladly came forwad
with cash subscriptions. Work in the distant Villages of the interior
was rather difficult. People did not know the nature of public work.
And yet we had invitations to visit far-away places, leading
merchants of every place extending their hospitality.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On one occasion during this tour the situation was rather  difficult.
We expected our host to contribute £6, but he refused to give
anything more than £3. If we had accepted that amount from him,
others would have follwed suit, and our collections would have been
spoiled. It was a late hour of the night, and we were all hungry. But
how could we dine without having first obtained the amount we were
bent on getting ? All persuasion was useless. The host seemed to be
adamant. Other merchants in the town reasoned with him, and we all
sat up throughout the night, he as well as we determined not to budge
one inch. Most of my co-workers were burning with rage, but they
contained themselves. At last, when day was already breaking, the
host yielded, paid down £6 and feasted us. This happened at Tonggat,
but the repercussion of the incident was felt as far as Stanger on
the North Coast and Charlestown in the interior. It also hastened our
work of collection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But collecting funds was not the only thing to do. In fact I had long
learnt the principle of never having more money at one’s disposal
than necessary.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Meetings used to be held once a month or even once a week if
required. Minutes of the proceedings of the preceding meeting would
be read, and all sorts of questions would be discussed. People had no
experience of taking part in public discussions or of speaking
briefly and to the point. Everyone hesitated to stand up to speak. I
explained to them the rules of procedure at meetings, and they
respected them. They realized that it was an education for them, and
many who had never been accustomed to speaking before an audience
soon acquired the habit of thinking and speaking publicly about
matters of public interest.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Knowing that in public work minor expenses at times absorb large
amounts, I had decided not to have even the receipt books printed in
the beginning. I had a cyclostyle machine in my office, on</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
which I took copies of receipts and reports. Such things I began to
get printed only when the Congress coffers were full, and when  the
number of members and work had increased. Such economy is essential
for every organization, and yet I know that it is not always
exercised. That is why I have thought it proper to enter into these
little details of the beginnings of a small but growing organization.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Poeple never cared to have receipts for the amounts they paid, but we
always insisted on the receipts being given. Every pie was thus
clearly accounted for, and I dare say the account books for the year
1894 can be found intact even today in the records of Natal Indian
Congress. Carefully kept accounts are a <i>sine qua non </i>for any
organization. Without them it falls into disrepute. Without properly
kept accounts it is impossible to maintain truth in its pristine
purity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Another feature of the Congress was service of Colonial-born educated
Indians. The Colonial-born Indian Educational Association was founded
under the auspices of the Congress. The members consisted mostly of
these educated youths. They had to pay a nominal subscription. The
association served to ventilate their needs and grievances, to
stimulate thought amongst them, to bring them into touch with Indian
merchants and also to afford them scope for service of the community.
It was a sort of debating society. The members met regularly and
spoke or read papers on different subjects. A small library was also
opened in connection with the Association.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
The third feature of the Congress was propaganda. This consisted in
acquainting the English in South Africa and England and people in
India with the real state of things in Natal. With that end in view I
wrote two pamphlets. The first was <i>An </i><i>Apeal </i><i>to </i><i>Every
Briton </i><i>in </i><i>South </i><i>Africa. </i>It contained a
statement, supported by evidence, of the general condition of Natal
Indians. The other was entitled <i>The </i><i>Indian </i><i>Franchise</i>—<i>An
</i><i>Appeal</i>. It contained a brief history of the Indian
franchise in Natal with facts and figures. I had devoted considerable
labour and study to the preparation of these pamphlets, and the
result was quite commensurate with the trouble taken. They were
widely circulated.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
All this activity resulted in winning the  Indians numerous friends
in Sourth Africa and in obtaining the active sympathy of all parties
in India. It also opened out and placed before the  South African
Indians a definite line of action.</p>

The heart’s earnest and pure desire is always fulfilled. In my own
experience I have often seen this rule verified. Service of the poor
has been my heart’s desire, and it has always thrown me amongst the
poor and enabled me to identify myself with them.</p>

Although the members of the Natal Indian Congress included the
Colonial-born Indians and the clerical class, the unskilled wage-
earners, the indentured labourers were still outside its pale. The
Congress was not yet theirs. They could not afford to belong to it by
paying the subscription and becoming its members. The Congress could
win their attachment only by serving them. An opportunity offered
itself when neither the Congress nor I was really ready for it. I had
put in scarcely three or four months’s practice, and the Congress
also was still in its infancy, when a Tamil man in tattered clothes,
head- gear in hand, two front teeth broken and his mouth bleeding,
stood before me trembling and weeping. He had been heavily belaboured
by his master. I learnt all about him from my clerk, who was a
Tamilian<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>.
Balasundaram, as that was the visitor’s name, was serving his
indenture under a well-known European resident of Durban. The master,
getting angry with him, had lost self-control, and had beaten
Balasundaram severely, breaking two of his teeth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I sent him to a doctor. In those days only white doctors were
available. I wanted a certificate from the doctor about the nature of
the injury Balasundaram had sustained. I secured the certificate, and
straightway took the injured man to the magistrate, to whom  I
submitted his affidavit. The magistrate was indignant when he read
it, and issued a summons against the employer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was far from my desire to get the employer punished.  I  simply
wanted Balasundaram to be released from him. I read the law about
indentured labour. If an ordinary servant left service without giving
notice, he was liable to be sued by his master in a civil court. With
the indentured labourer the case was entirely different. He was
liable, in similar circumstances, to be proceeded against in a
criminal court and to be imprisoned on conviction. That is why Sir
William Hunter called the indenture system almost as bad as slavery.
Like the slave the indentured labourer was the property of his
master.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
There were only two ways of relasing Balasundaram: either by getting
the Protector of Indentured Labourers to cancel his indenture or
transfer him to someone else, or by getting Bala- sundaram’s
employer to release him. I called on the latter and said to him : ‘I
do</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
not want to proceed against you and get you punished. I think you
realize that you have severly beaten the man. I shall be satisfied if
you will transfer the indenture to someone else.’ To this he
readily agreed. I next saw the Protector. He also agreed, on
condition that I found a new employer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
So I went off in search of an employer. He had to be a Euro- pean, as
no Indians could employ indentured labour. At that time I knew very
few Europeans. I met one of them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>He very kindly agreed to take on Balasundaram. I
gratefully acknowledged his kindness. The magistrate convicted
Balasundaram’s employer, and recorded that he had undertaken to
transfer the indenture to someone else.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Balasundaram’s case reached the ears of every indentured labourer,
and I came to be regarded as their friend. I hailed this connection
with delight. A regular stream of indentured labourers began to pour
into my office, and I got the best opportunity of  learning their
joys and sorrows.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
The echoes of Balansundaram’s case were heard in far off Madras.
Labourers from different parts of the province, who went to Natal on
indenture, came to know of this case through  their indentured
brethren.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
There was nothing extraordinary in the case itself, but the fact that
there was someone in Natal to espouse their casue and publicly work
for them gave the indentured labourers a joyful surprise and inspired
them with hope.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
I have said that Balasundaram entered my office, head-gear in hand.
There was a peculiar pathos about the circumstance which also showed
our humiliation. I have already narrated the incident when I was
asked to take off my turban. A practice had been forced upon every
indentured labourer and every Indian stranger to take off his
head-gear when visiting a Euopean, whether the head-gear were a cap,
a turban or a scarf wrapped round the head. A salute even with both
hands was not sufficient. Balasundaram thought that he should follow
the practice even with me. This was the first case in my experience.
I felt humiliated and asked him to tie up his scarf. He did so, not
with- out a certain hesitation, but I could perceive the pleasure on
his face.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
It has always been a mystery to me how men can feel themselves
honoured by the humiliation of their fellow-beings.</p>

Balasundaram’s case brought me into touch with the indentured
Indians. What impelled me, however, to make a deep study of their
condition was the campaign for bringing them under special heavy
taxation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In  the  same   year,   1894,   the   Natal   Government   sought<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to impose   an   annual   tax   of   £25<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>on   the   indentured   Indians.   The proposal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>astonished me. I put the matter before the Congress 
for discussion, and it was immediately resolved to organize the
necessary opposition.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
At the outset I must explain briefly the genesis of the tax.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
About the year 1860 the Europeans in Natal, finding that there was
considerable scope for sugarcane cultivation, felt themselves in need
of labour. Without outside labour the cultivation of cane and the
manufacture of sugar were impossible, as the Natal Zulus were not
suited to this form of work. The Natal Government therefore
corresponded with the Indian Government, and secured their permission
to recruit Indian labour. These recruits were to sign an indenture to
work in Natal for five years, and at the end of the term they were to
be at liberty to settle there and to have full rights of ownership of
land. Those were the inducements held out to them, for the whites
then had looked forward to improving their agriculture by the
industry of the Indian labourers after the term of their indentures
had expired.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But the Indians gave more than had been expected of them. They grew
large quantities of vegatables. They introduced a number of Indian
varieties and made it possible to grow the local varieties cheaper.
They also introduced the mango. Nor did their enterprise stop at
agriculture. They entered trade. They purchased land for building,
and many raised themselves from the status of labourers to that of
owners of land and houses. Merchants from India followed them and
settled there for trade. The late Sheth Abubakar Amod was first among
them. He soon built up an extensive business.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The white traders were alarmed. When they first welcomed the Indian
labourers, they had not reckoned with their business skill. They
might be tolerated as independent agriculturists, but their
competition in trade could not be brooked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
This sowed the seed of the antagonism to Indians. Many other factors
contributed to its growth. Our different ways of living, our
simplicity, our contentment with small gains, our indifference to the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
laws of hygiene and sanitation, our slowness in keeping our
surroundings clean and tidy, and our stinginess in keeping our houses
in good repair—all these, combined with the difference in religion,
contributed to fan the flame of antagonism. Through legislation this
antagonism found its expression in the disfranchising bill and the
bill to impose a tax on the indentured Indians. Independent of
legislation a number of pinpricks had already been started.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The first suggestion was that the India labourers should be forcibly
repatriated, so that the term of their indentures might expire in
India. The Government of India was not likely to accept the
suggestion. Another proposal was therefore made to the effect that</p>

A deputation composed of Sir Henry Binns and Mr. Mason was sent to
India to get the proposal approved by the Government there. The
Viceroy at that time was Lord Elgin. He disapproved of the £25 tax,
but agreed to a poll tax of £3. I thought then, as I do even now,
that this was a serious blunder on the part of the Viceroy. In giving
his approval he had in no way thought of the interests of India. It
was no part of his duty thus to accommodate the Natal Europeans. In
the course of three of four years an indentured labourer with his
wife and each male child over 16 and female child over 13 came under
the impost. To levy a yearly tax of £12 from a family of
four—husband, wife and two children—when the average income of
the husband was never more than 14s. a month, was atrocious and
unknown anywhere else in the world.</p>

the subject, the Viceroy might have approved of even the £25 tax.
The reduction from £25 to £3 was probably due solely to the
Congress agitation. But I may be mistaken in thinking so. It may be
possible that the Indian Government had dis- approved of the £25 tax
from the beginning and reduced it to £3<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup>,

The Congress could not regard it as any great achievement to have
succeeded in getting the tax reduced from £25 to £3<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup>.
The regret was still there that it had not completely safeguarded the
interest of the indentured Indians. It ever remained its
determination to get the tax remitted, but it was twenty years before
the detemination was realized. And when it was realized, it came as a
result of the labours of not only the Natal Indians but of all the
Indians in South Africa. The breach of faith with the late Mr.
Gokhale became the occasion of the final campaign, in which the
indentured Indians took their full share, some of them losing their
lives as a result of the firing that was resorted to, and over ten
thousand suffering imprisonment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But truth triumphed in the end. The sufferings of the Indians were
the expression of that truth. Yet it would not have triumphed except
for unflinching faith, great patience and incessant effort. Had the
community given up the struggle, had the Congress abandoned the
campaign and submitted to the tax as inevitable, the hated<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>impost would have continued to be levied from the
indentured Indians until this day, to the eternal shame of the
Indians in South Africa and of the whole of India.</p>

If I found myself entirely absorbed in the service of the community,
the reason behind it was my desire for self-realization. I had made
the religion of service my own, as I felt that God could be realized
only through service. And service for me was the service of India,
because it came to me without my seeking, because I had an aptitude
for it. I had gone to South Africa for travel, for finding an escape
from Kathiawad intrigues and for gaining my own livelihood. But as I
have said, I found myself in search of God and striving for
self-realization.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Christian   friends   had   whetted   my   appetite   for  
knowledge<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>,
which had become almost insatiable, and they would not leave me in
peace, even if I desired to be indifferent. In Durban Mr. Spencer
Walton, the head of the South Africa General Mission, found me out. I
became almost a member of his family. At the back of this
acquaintance was of course my contact with christians in Pretoria.
Mr. Walton had a manner all his own. I do not recollect his ever
having invited me to embrace Christianity. But he placed his life as
an open book before me, and let me watch all his movements. Mrs.
Walton was a very gentle and talented woman. I liked the attitude of
this couple.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
We knew the fundamental differences between us. Any amount of
discussion could not efface them. Yet even differences prove helpful,
where there are tolerance, charity and truth. I liked Mr. and Mrs.
Walton’s humility, perseverance and devotion to work, and we met
very frequently.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This freindship kept alive my interest in religion. It was impossible
now to get the leisure that I used to have in Pretoria for my
religious studies. But what little time I could spare I turned to
good account. My relgious correspondence continued. Raychandbhai was
guiding me. Some friend sent me Narmadashanker’s book <i>Dharma
</i><i>Vichar</i>. Its preface proved very helpful. I had heard about
the Bohemian way in which the poet had lived, and a description in
the preface of the revolution effected in his life by his religious
studies<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2 </font></sup>captivated
me. I came to like the book, and read it from cover to cover with
attention. I read with interest Max Muller’s book, <i>India</i>—<i>What
</i><i>Can It </i><i>Teach </i><i>Us ? </i>and the translation of the
Upanishads published by the Theosophical Society. All this enhanced
my regard for Hinduism, and its beauties began to grow upon me. It
did not, however, prejudice me against other religions. I read
Washington Irving’s  <i>Life  of </i><i>Mahomet </i><i>and His
</i><i>Successors </i>and Carlyle’s panegyric on the Prophet. These
books raised Muhammad in my estimation I also read a book called <i>The
</i><i>Sayings </i><i>of</i><i> </i><i>Zarathustra</i>.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus I gained more knowledge of the different religions. The study
stimulated my self-introspection and fostered in me the habit of
putting into practice whatever appealed to me in my studies. Thus I
began some of the Yogic practices<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>,
as well as I could  understand them from a reading of the Hindu
books. But I could not get on very far, and decided to follow them
with the help of some expert when I returned to India. The desire has
never been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I made too an intensive study of Tolstoy’s books. <i>The Gospels in
Brief, What to Do ? </i>and other books made a deep impression on me.
I began to realize more and more the infinite possibilities of
universal love.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
About the same time I came in contact with another Christian family.
At their suggestion I attended the Wesleyan church every Sunday. For
these days I also had their standing invi- tation to dinner. The
church did not make a favourable impression on me.  The  sermons
seemed to be uninspiring. The congregation did not strike me as being
particularly religious<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>.
They were not an assembly of devout souls; they appeared rather to be
worldly- minded people, going to church for recreation and in
conformity to custom. Here, at times, I would involuntarily doze. I
was ashamed, but some of my</p>

neighbours, who were in no better case, lightended the shame. I could
not go on long like this, and soon gave up attending the service.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
My connection with the family I used to visit every Sunday was
abruptly broken. In fact it may be said that I was warned to visit it
no more. It happened thus. My hostess was a good and simple woman,
but somewhat narrow-minded. We always discussed religious subjects. I
was then re-reading Arnold’s <i>Light </i><i>of Asia. </i>Once we
began to compare the life of Jesus with that of Buddha. ‘Look at
Gautama’s compassion !’ said I. ‘It was not confined to
mankind, it was extended to all living beings. Does not one’s heart
overflow with love to think of the lamb joyously perched on his
shoulders ? One fails to notice this love for all living beings in
the life<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
Jesus.’ The comparison pained the good lady. I could understand her
feelings. I cut the matter short, and we went to the dining-room. Her
son, a cherub  aged scarcely five, was also with us. I am happiest
when in the midst of children, and this youngster and I had long been
friends. I spoke derisively<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
the piece of meat on his plate and in high praise of the apple on
mine. The innocent boy was carried away and joined in my praise of
the fruit.</p>

  not   without trepidation. I did not see that I should stop going
there, I did not think it proper either. But the good lady made my
way easy.</p>

To set up a household was no new experience for me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>But
the establishment in Natal was different from the ones that I had had
in Bombay and London. This time part of the expense was solely for
the sake of prestige. I thought it necessary to have a household in
keeping with my position as an Indian barrister in Natal and as  a
representative. So I had a nice little house in a prominent locality.
It was also suitably furnished. Food was simple but as I used to
invite English friends and Indian co-workers, the housekeeping bills
were always fairly high.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
A good servant is essential in every household. But I have never
known how to keep anyone as a servant.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
I had a friend<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>as companion and help, and a cook who had become a
member of the family. I also had office clerks boarding and lodging
with me. I think I had a fair amount of success in this experiment,
but it was not without its modicum of the bitter experience of life.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The companion was very clever and, I thought, faithful to me. But in
this I was decieved. He became jealous of an office clerk who was
staying with me, and wove such a tangled web that I suspected the
clerk. This clerical friend had a temper of his own. Immediately he
saw that he had been the object of my suspicion,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>he  left  both  the house and the office. I was
pained. I felt that perhaps I had been unjust to him, and my
conscience always stung me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
In the meanwhile, the cook needed a few days’ leave, or for some
other cause was away<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>.
 It  was  necessary  to  procure  another during his absence. Of this
new man I learnt later that he was a perfect scamp. But for me he
proved a godsend. Within two or three days of his arrival, he
discovered certain irregularities that were  going  on under my roof
without my knowledge, and he made up his mind to warn me. I had the
reputation of being a credulous but straight man. The discovery was
to him, therefore, all the more shocking. Every day at one o’clock
I used to go home from office for lunch. At about twelve o’clock
one day the cook came panting to the office, and said, ‘Please come
home at once. There is a surprise for you.’</p>

I felt an appeal in his persistence. I went home accompanied by a
clerk and the cook who walked ahead of us. He took me straight to the
upper floor, pointed at my companion’s room, and said, ‘Open this

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This made him worse. There was no help for it. So I said to the clerk
standing downstairs: ‘Please go and inform the Police Supe-
rintendent, with my compliments, that a person living with me has
misbehaved himself<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7</font></sup>.

shall be much obliged if police help can be sent me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This showed him that I was in earnest. His guilt unnerved him. He
apologized to me, entreated me not to inform<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the  police,  and agreed to leave the house
immediately, which he did.</p>

The incident came as a timely warning in my life<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup>.
Only now could I see clearly how thoroughly I had been beguiled by
this evil genius.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10   </font></sup>In
harbouring him I had chosen a bad means for a good end. I had
expected to ‘gather figs of thistles’. I had known that the

to me. In the attempt to reform him I was near ruining myself. I had
disregarded the warnings of kind friends. Infatuation had completely
blinded me.</p>

But for the new cook I should never have discovered the truth and,
being under the influence of the companion, I should probably have
been unable to lead the life of detachment that I then began.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

the need of my presence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>So I made up my mind to go home, fetch my wife and
children, and then return and settle out there. I also saw that, if I
went home, I might be able to do there some public work by educating
public opinion and creating more interest in the Indians of South
Africa. The £3 tax was an open sore. There could be no peace until
it was abolished.</p>

But who was to take charge of the Congress work and Education Society
in my absence ? I could think of two men—Adamji Miyakhan and Parsi
Rustomji. There were many workers now available from the commercial
class. But the foremost among those who could fulfil the duties of
the secretary by regular work, and who also commanded the regard of
the Indian community, were these two. The secretary certainly needed
a working knowledge of English. I recommended the late Adamji
Miyakhan’s name to the Congress, and it approved of his appointment
as secretary. Experience showed that the choice was a very happy one.
Adamji Miyakhan satisfied all with his perseverance, liberality,
amiability and courtesy, and proved to everyone that the secretary’s
work did not require a man with a barrister’s degree or high
English education.</p>

two English officers, with whom I came in close contact. With one of
them I used to play chess for an hour daily. The ship’s doctor gave
me a <i>Tamil Self-teacher </i>which I began to study. My experience
in Natal had shown me that I should acquire a knowledge of Urdu to
get into closer contact with the Mussalmans, and of Tamil to get into
closer touch with the Madras Indians.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At the request of the English friend, who read Urdu with me,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I found out a good Urdu munshi from amongst the deck
passengers, and we made excellent progress in our studies. The
officer had a better memory than I. He would never forget a word
after once he had seen it; I often found it difficult to decipher
Urdu letters. I brought more perseverance to bear, but could never
overtake the officer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
With Tamil I made fair progress. There was no help available, but the
<i>Tamil Self-teacher </i>was a well-written book, and I did not feel
in need of much outside help.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I had hoped to continue these studies even after reaching India, but
it was impossible. Most of my reading<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>since
1893 has been done in jail. I did make some progress in Tamil and
Urdu, in jails—Tamil in South African jails, and Urdu in Yeravda
Jail. But I never learnt to speak Tamil, and the little I could do by
way of reading is now rusting away for want of practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I still feel what a handicap this ignorance of Tamil or Telugu<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5
</font></sup>has   been.   The   affection   that   the  
Dravidians<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>in
  Sourth   Africa showered on me has remained a cherished memory.
Whenever I see a Tamil or Telugu friend, I cannot but recall the
faith, perseverance and selfless sacrifice of many of his compatriots
in South Africa. And they were mostly illiterate, the men no less
than the women. The fight in South Africa was for such, and it was
fought by illiterate soldiers; it was for the poor, and the poor took
their full share in it. Ignorance of their language, however, was
never a handicap to me in stealing the hearts of these simple and
good countrymen. They spoke broken Hindustani or broken English, and
we found no difficulty in getting on with our work. But I wanted to
requite their affection by learning Tamil and Telugu. In Tamil, as I
have said, I made some little progress, but in Telugu. which I tried
to learn in India, I did not get beyond the alphabet. I fear now I
can never learn these languages, and am therefore hoping that the
Dravidians will learn Hindustani. The non-English-speaking among
them<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

But I have digressed. Let me finish the narrative of my voyage. I
have to introduce to my readers the Captain of the s.s. <i>Pongola.
</i>We had become friends. The good Captain was a Plymouth Brother.
Our talks were more about spiritual subjects than nautical. He drew a
line between morality and faith. The teaching of the Bible was to him
child’s play. Its beauty lay in its simplicity. Let all, men, women
and children, he would say, have faith in Jesus and his sacrifice,
and their sins were sure to be redeemed. This friend revived my
memory of the Plymouth Brother of Pretoria. The religion that imposed
any moral restrictions was to him no good. My vegetarian food had
been the occasion of the whole of this discussion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Why
should I not eat meat, or for that matter beef ? Had not God created
all the lower animals for the enjoyment of mankind as, for instance,
he had created the  vegetable kingdom ? These questions inevitably
drew us into religious discussion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.49cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
We could not convince each other. I was confirmed in my opinion that
religion and morality were synonymous. The Captain had no doubt about
the correctness of his opposite conviction.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At the end of twenty-four days the pleasant voyage came to a close,
and admiring the beauty of the Hooghly, I landed at Calcutta. The
same day I took the train for Bombay.</p>

On my way to Bombay the train stopped at Allahabad for forty- five
minutes. I decided to utilize the interval for a drive<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>through
the town. I also had to purchase some medicine at a chemist’s shop.
The chemist was half asleep, and took an unconscionable time in 
dispensing the medicine, with the result that when  I  reached  the
station, the train had just started. The Station Master had kindly
detained the train one minute for my sake, but not seeing me coming,
and carefully ordered my luggage to be taken out of the train.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I took a room at Kellner’s, and decided to start work there and
then. I had heard a good deal about <i>The </i><i>Pioneer </i>published
from Allahabad, and I had understood it to be an opponent of Indian
aspirations. I have an impression that Mr. Chesney Jr. was the editor
at that time. I wanted to secure the help of every party, so I wrote
a note to Mr. Chesney, telling him how I had missed the train, and
asking for an appointment so as to enable me to leave the next day.
He immediately gave me one, at which I was very happy especially when
I found that he gave me a patient hearing. He promised to notice in
his paper anything that I might write, but added that he could not
promise to endorse all the Indian demands, inasmuch as he was bound
to</p>

well.</p>

‘It is enough’, I said, ‘that you should study the question and

justice that is due to us.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The rest of the day was spent in having a look round admiring the 
magnificent  confluence   of   the   three   rivers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

This unexpected interview with the editor of <i>The Pioneer </i>laid
the foundation of the series of incidents which ultimately led to my
being lynched in Natal.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I went straight to Rajkot without halting at Bombay and began to make
preparations for writing a pamphlet on the situation in South
Africa<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>. The
writing and publication of the pamphlet took about a month<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>. It had a green cover and came to be known afterwards
as the Green Pamphlet. In it I drew a purposely subdued picuture of
the condition of Indians in South Africa. The language I used was
more moderate than that of the two pamphlets<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>which I have referred to before, as I knew that
things heard of from a distance appear bigger than they are.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Ten thousand copies were printed and sent to all the papers and
leaders of every party in India. <i>The Pioneer </i>was the first to
notice it editorially. A summary of the article was cabled by Reuter
to England, and a summary of that summary was cabled to Natal by
Reuter’s London office. This cable was not longer than three lines
in print. It was a miniature, but exaggerated,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>edition of the picture I had drawn of the treatment
accorded to the Indians in Natal, and it was not in my words. We
shall see later on the effect this had in Natal. In the meanwhile
every paper of note commented at length on the question.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
To get these pamphlets ready for posting was no small matter. It
would have been expensive too, if I had employed paid help for
preparing wrappers, etc. But I hit upon a much simpler plan. I
gathered together all the children in my locality and asked them to
volunteer two or three hours’ labour of a morning, when they had no
school.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Plague broke out <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6 </font></sup>in
Bombay about this time, and there was panic all around. There was
fear of an outbreak in Rajkot. As I felt that I could be of some help
in the sanitation department, I offered my services to the State.
They were accepted, and I was put on the committee which was
appointed to look into the question. I laid especial emphasis on the
cleanliness of latrines, and the committee decided to inspect these
in every street. The poor people had no objection to their latrines
being inspected, and what is more, they carried out the improvements
suggested to them. But when we went to inspect the houses of the
upper ten,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>some of them even refused us admission,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8
 </font></sup>not to talk of listening to our suggestions. It was our
visit in my life to such a locality. The men and women there were
surprised to see common experience that the latrines of the rich were
more unclean. They were dark and stinking and reeking with filth and
worms.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The improvements we suggested were quite simple, e.g.,
to have buckets for excrement instead of allowing it to drop on the
ground; to see that urine also was collected in buckets, instead of
allowing it to soak into the ground, and to demolish the partitions
between the outer walls and the latrines, so as to give the latrines
more light and air and enable the scavenger to clean them properly.
The upper classes raised numerous objections to this last
improvement, and in most cases it was not carried out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The committee had to inspect the untouchables’ quarters also. Only
one member of the committee was ready to accompany me there. To the
rest it was something preposterous to visit those quarters, still
more so to inspect their latrines. But for me those quarters were an
agreeable surprise. That was the first us. I asked them to let us
inspect their latrines.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Latrines for us !’ they exclaimed in astonishment. ‘We go and
perform our functions out in the open. Latrines are for you big
people.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Well, then, you won’t mind if we inspect your houses ?’ I
asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You are perfectly welcome, sir. You may see every nook and corner
of our houses. Ours are no houses, they are holes.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I went in and was delighted to see that the insides were as clean as
the outsides. The entrances were well swept, the floors were
beautifully smeared with cow-dung, and the few pots and pans were
clean and shining. There was no fear of an outbreak in those</p>

In the upper class quarters<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11
   </font></sup>we came across a latrine which I cannot help
describing in some detail. Every room had its gutter, which was used
both for water and urine, which meant that the whole house would
stink. But one of the houses had a storeyed bed-room with a gutter
which was being used both as a urinal and a latrine. The gutter had a
pipe descending to the ground floor. It was not possible to stand the
foul smell in this room. How the occupants could sleep there I leave
the readers to imagine.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The committee also visited the Vaishnava <i>Haveli</i>. The priest in
charge of the <i>Haveli </i>was very friendly with my family. So he
agreed to let us inspect everything and suggest whatever improvements
we liked.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>There was a part of the  <i>Haveli</i><i> </i>premises
that he himself had never seen. It was the place where refuse and
leaves used as dinner- plates used to be thrown over the wall. It was
the haunt of crows and kites. The latrines were of course dirty. I
was not long enough in Rajkot to see how many of our suggestions the
priest carried out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.49cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It pained me to see so much uncleanliness about a place of worship.
One would expect a careful observance of the rules of sanitation and
hygiene in a place which is regarded as holy. The authors of the
<i>smritis</i>, as I knew even then, have laid the greatest emphasis
on cleanliness both inward and outward.</p>

Hardly ever have I known anybody to cherish such loyalty as I did to
the British Constitution<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>.
I can see now that my love of truth was at the root of this loyalty.
It has never been possible for me to simulate loyalty or, for that
matter, any other virtue. The National Anthem<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>used to be sung at every meeting that I attended in
Natal. I then felt that I must also join in the singing. Not that I
was unaware of the defects in British rule, but I thought that it was
on the whole acc- eptable. In those days I believed that British
rule<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was on the whole beneficial to the ruled.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The colour prejudice that I saw in South Africa was, I thought, quite
contrary to British traditions, and I believed that it was only
temporary and local. I therefore vied with Englishmen in loyalty to
the throne. With careful perseverance I learnt the tune of the
National Anthem<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and joined in the singing whenever it was sung.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

loyalty without fuss or ostentation, I readily took part in it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Never in my life did I exploit this loyalty, never did I seek to gain
a selfish end by its means. It was for me more in the nature of an</p>

Preparations were going on for the celebration of Queen Victoria’s
Diamond Jubilee when I reached India. I was invited to join the
committee appointed for the purpose in Rajkot. I accepted the offer,
but had a suspicion that the celebrations would be largely a matter
of show. I discovered much humbug about them and was con- siderably
pained. I began to ask myself whether I should remain on the
committee or not, but ultimately decided to rest content with doing
my part of the business.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One of the proposals was to plant trees. I saw that many did it
merely for show and for pleasing the officials. I tried to plead with
them that tree-planting was not compulsory, but merely a suggestion.
It should be done seriously or not at all. I have an impression that
they laughed at my ideas. I remember that I was in earnest when I
planted the tree allotted to me and that I carefully watered and
tended it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup></p>

I likewise taught the National Anthem<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

taught it to students of the local Training College, but I forget

sing those lines. How could we assume that the so-called ‘enemies’
were ‘knavish’? And because they were enemies, were they bound to

Like loyalty an aptitude for nursing was also deeply rooted in my

meetings, and Bombay was the first city I chose. First of all I met
Justice Ranade<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>,
who listened to me with attention, and advised me to meet Sir
Pherozeshah Mehta. Justice Badruddin Tyabji, who I met next, also
gave the same advice. ‘Justice Ranade and I can guide you but
little,’ he said. ‘You know our position. We cannot take an
active part in public affairs, but our sympathies are with you. The
man who can effectively guide you is Sir Pherozeshah Mehta.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I certainly wanted to see Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, but the fact that
these senior men advised me to act according to his advice gave me a
better idea of the immense influence that Sir Phirozeshah had on the
public. In due course I met him. I was prepared to be awed by his
presence. I had heard of the popular titles that he had earned, and
knew that I was to see the ‘Lion of Bombay’, the ‘Uncrowned
King of the Presidency’. But the king did not overpower me. He met
me, as  a loving father would meet his grown-up son. Our meeting took
place at his chamber. He was surrounded by a circle of friends and
followers. Amongst them were Mr. D. E. Wacha and Mr. Cama, to whom I
was introduced. I had already heard of Mr. Wacha. He was regarded as
the right-hand man of Sir Pherozeshah, and Sjt. Virchand Gandhi had
described him to me as a great statistician. Mr. Wacha said, ‘Gandhi,
we must meet again.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
These introductions could scarcely have taken two minutes. Sir
Pherozeshah carefully listened to me. I told him that I had  seen
Justices Ranade and Tyabji. ‘Gandhi,’ said he, ‘I see that I
must help you. I must call a public meeting here.’ With this he
truned to Mr. Munshi, the secretary, and told him to fix up the date
of the meeting. The date was settled, and he bade me good-bye, asking
me to see him again on the day previous to the meeting. The interview
removed my fears, and I went home delighted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
During this stay in Bombay I called on my brother-in-law, who was
staying there and lying ill. He was not a man of means, and my sister
(his wife) was not equal to nursing him. The illness was serious, and
I offered to take him to Rajkot. He agreed<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T14</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, and so I returned home with my sister and her husband.
The illness was much more prolonged than I had expected. I put my
brother-in-law in my room and remained with him night and day. I was
obliged to keep awake part of the night and had to get through some
of my South African work whilst I was nursing him. Ultimately,
however, the patient died, but it was a great consolation to me that
I had had an opportunity to nurse him during his last days.</p>

On the very day after my brother-in-law’s death I had to go to
Bombay for the public meeting. There had hardly been time for me to
think out my speech. I was feeling exhausted after days and nights of
anxious vigil, and my voice had become husky. However, I went to
Bombay trusting entirely to God. I had never dreamt of writing out my
speech.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

On going to the meeting the next day, I saw that wisdom of Sir
Pherozeshah’s advice. The meeting was held in the hall of Sir
Cowasji Jehangir Institute. I had heard that when Sir Pherozeshah
Mehta addressed meetings the hall was always packed, chiefly by the
students intent on hearing him, leaving not an inch of room. This was
the first meeting of the kind in my experience. I saw that my voice
could reach only a few. I was trembling as I began to read my
speech.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

My old friend Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande came to my rescue. I handed my
speech to him. His was just the proper voice. But the audience
refused to listen. The hall rang with the cries of ‘Wacha’,
‘Wacha’. So Mr. Wacha stood up and read the speech, with
wonderful results. The audience became perfectly quiet, and listened 
to  the speech to the end, punctuating it with applause and cries of
‘shame’ where necessary. This gladdened my heart.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
Sir Pherozeshah liked the speech. I was supremely happy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The meeting won me the active sympathy of Sjt. Deshpande and a Parsi
friend, whose name I hesitate to mention, as he is a high-placed
Government official today. Both expressed their resolve to accompany
me to South Africa.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Mr.
C. M. Cursetji, who was then Small Causes Court Judge, however, moved
the Parsi friend from his resolve as he had plotted his marriage<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>.
He had to choose between marriage and going to South Africa, and he
chose the former. But Parsi Rustomji made amends for the broken
resolve, and a number of Parsi sisters are now making amends for the
lady who helped in the breach by dedicating themselves to khadi work.
I have  therefore gladly forgiven that couple. Sjt. Deshpande had no
temptations of marriage, but he too could not come. Today he is
himself doing enough reparation for the broken pledge. On my way back
to Sourth Africa I met one of the Tyabjis at Zanzibar. He also
promised to come and help me, but never came. Mr. Abbas Tyabji is
atoning for that offence. Thus none of my three attempts to induce
barristers to go to South Africa bore any fruit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In this connection I remember Mr. Pestonji Padshah. I had been on
friendly terms with him ever since my stay in England. I first met
him in a vegetarian restaurant in London. I knew of his brother Mr.
Barjorji Padshah by his reputation as a ‘crank’. I had never met
him, but friends said that he was eccentric. Out of pity for the
horses, he would not ride in tram-cars, he refused to take degrees in
spite of a prodigious memory, he had develo -ped an independent
spirit<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>,
and he was a vegetarian, thougha Parsi. Pestonji had not quite this
reputation, but he was famous for his erudition even in London. The
common factor between us, however, was vegetarianism, and not
scholarship in which it was beyond my power to approach him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I found him out again in Bombay. He was Prothonotary in the High
Court. When I met him he was engaged on his contribution to a Higher
Gujarati Dictionary. There was not a friend I had not approached for
help in my Sourth African work. Pestonji Padshah, however, not only
refused to aid me, but even advised me not to return</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
to South Africa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is impossible to help you,’ he said. ‘But I tell you I do
not like even <i>your </i>going to South Africa. Is there lack of
work in our own country ? Look, now, there is not a little to do for
our language. I have to find out scientific words. But this is only
one branch of the work. Think of the poverty of the land. Our people
in Sourth Africa are no doubt in difficulty, but I do not want a man
like you to be sacrificed for that work. Let us win self-government
here, and we shall automatically help our countrymen there. I know I
cannot prevail upon you, but I will not encourage anyone of your type
to throw in his lot with you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I did not like this advice, but it increased my regard for Mr.
Pestonji Padshah. I was struck with his love for the country and for
the mother tongue. The incident brought us closer to each other. I
could understand his point of view. But far from giving up my work in
South Africa, I became firmer in my resolve.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

This was my first meeting with the Lokamanya. It revealed to me the
secret of his unique popularity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Next I met Gokhale. I found him on the Fergusson College grounds. He
gave me an affectionate welcome, and his manner immediately won my
heart. With him too this was my first meeting, and yet it seemed as
though we were renewing an old friendship. Sir Pherozeshah had seemed
to me like the Himalaya, the Lokamanya like the ocean. But Gokhale
was the Ganges. One could have a refreshing bath in the holy river.
The Himalaya was unscalable, and one could not easily launch forth on
the sea,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>but
the Ganges invited one to its bosom. It was a joy to be on it with a
boat and an oar. Gokhale closely examined me, as a schoolmaster would
examine a candidate seeking admission to a school. He told me whom to
approach and how to approach them. He asked to have a look at my
speech. He showed me over the college, assured me that he was always
at my disposal, asked me to let him know the result of the interview
with Dr. Bhandarkar, and sent me away  exultantly  happy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>.
 In  the sphere of politics the place that Gokhale occupied in my
heart during his lifetime and occupies even now was and is absolutely
unique.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Bhandarkar received me with the warmth of a father. It was noon
when I called on him. The very fact that I was busy seeing people at
that hour appealed greatly to this indefatigable savant, and my
insistence of a non-party man for the president of the meeting had
his ready approval, which was expressed in the spontaneous
exclamation, ‘That’s it’, ‘That’s it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After he had heard me out he said : ‘Anyone will tell you that I do
not take part in politics. But I cannot refuse you. Your case is so
strong and your industry is so admirable that I cannot decline to
take part in your meeting. You did well in consulting Tilak and
Gokhale. Please tell them that<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

me good-bye with congratulations and blessings.</p>

The greatest help here came to me from the late Sjt. G. Parameshvaran
Pillay, the editor of <i>The Madras Standard</i>. He had made a
careful study of the question, and he often invited me to his office
and gave me guidance. Sjt. G. Subramaniam of  <i>The Hindu</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7
</font></sup>and Dr. Subramaniam also were very sympathetic. But Sjt.
G. Parameshvaran Pillay placed the columns of <i>The Madras Standard

with Dr. Subramaniam in the chair.</p>

The affection showered on me by most of the friends I met and their
enthusiasm for the cause were so great that, in spite of my having to
communicate with them in English, I felt myself entirely at home.

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
From Madras I proceeded to Calcutta where I found myself hemmed in by
difficulties. I knew no one there. So I took a room in the Great
Eastern Hotel. Here I became acquainted with Mr. Ellertho- rpe, a
representative of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>. He invited me to the
Bengal Club, where he was staying. He did not then realize that an
Indian could not be taken to the drawing-room of the club. Having
discovered the restriction, he took me to his room. He expressed his
sorrow regarding this prejudice of the local Englishmen and apolo-
gized to me for not having been able to take me to the drawing-room.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had of course to see Surendranath Banerji, the ‘Idol of Bengal’.
When I met him, he was surrounded by a number of friends. He said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I am afraid people will not take interest in your work. As you
know, our difficulties here are by no means few. But you must try as
best you can. You will have to enlist the sympathy of Maharajas.
Mind, you meet the representatives of the British Indian Association.
You should meet Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji and Maharaja Tagore. Both
are liberal-minded and take a fair share in public work.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I met these gentlemen, but without success. Both gave me a cold
reception and<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>said it was no easy thing to call a public meeting in</p>

Calcutta, and if anything could be done, it would  practically  all
depend on Surendranath Banerji.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I saw that my task was becoming more and more difficult. I called at
the office of the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i>. The gentleman whom  I
met there took me to be a wandering Jew. <i>The </i><i>Bangabasi </i>went
even one better. The editor kept me waiting for an hour. He had
evidently many interviewers, but he would not so much as look at me,
even when he had disposed of the rest.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>On
my venturing to broach my subject after the long wait, he said :
‘Don’t you see our hands are full</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
? There is no end to the number of visitors like you. You had better
go. I am not disposed to listen to you.’ For a moment I felt
offended, but I quickly understood the editor’s position. I had
heard of the fame of <i>The </i><i>Bangabasi</i>. I could see that
there was a regular stream of visitors there. And they were all
people acquainted with him. His paper had no lack of topics to
discuss, and South Africa was hardly known at that time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
However serious a grievance may be in the eyes of the man who suffers
from it, he will be but one of the numerous people invading the
editor’s office, each with a grievance of his own. How is the
editor to meet them all ? Moreover, the aggrieved party imagines that
the editor is a power in the land. Only he knows that his power can
hardly travel beyond the threshold of his office. But I was not
discouraged. I kept on seeing editors of other papers. As usual I met
the Anglo- Indian editors also.  <i>Th</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>Statesma</i><i>n

Mr. Saunders, editor of <i>The Englishan, </i>claimed me as his own.
He placed his office and paper at my disposal. He even allowed me the
liberty of making whatever changes I liked in the leading article he
had written on the situation, the proof of which he sent me in
advance.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Throughout my life I have had the privilege of many such friendships,
which have sprung up quite unexpectedly. What Mr. Saunders liked in
me was my freedom from exaggeration and my devotion to truth. He
subjected me to a searching cross-examination before he began to
sympathize with my cause,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The unexpected help of Mr. Saunders had begun to encourage me to
think that I might succeed after all in holding a public meeting in
Calcutta, when I received the following cable from Durban :
‘Parliament opens January. Return soon.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So I addressed a letter to the Press, in which I explained why I had
to leave Calcutta so abruptly, and set off for Bombay. Before
starting I wired to the Bombay agent of Dada Abdulla &amp; Co. to
arrange for my passage by the first possible boat to South Africa.
Dada Abdulla had just then purchased the steamship <i>Courland </i>and
insisted on my travelling on that boat, offering to take me and my
family free of charge. I gratefully accepted the offer, and in the
beginning of December<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>set
sail a second time for South Africa, now with my wife and two sons<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Another steamship <i>Naderi </i>also sailed for Durban at the same
time. The agents of the Company were Dada Abdulla &amp; Co. The total
number of passengers these boats carried must have been about eight
hundred,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

This was my first voyage with my wife and children. I have often
observed in the course of this narrative<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that,
 on  account  of child marriages amongst middle-class Hindus, the
husband will be literate whilst the wife remains practically
unlettered. A wide gulf thus separates them, and the husband has to
become his wife’s teacher. So I had to think out the details of the
dress to be adopted by my wife and children, the food they were to
eat, and the manners which would be suited to their new surroundings.
Some of the recollections of  those days are amusing to look back
upon.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">

I believed, at the time of which I am writing, that in order to look
civilized, our dress and manners had as far as possible to
approximate to the European standard. Becuase, I thought, only thus
could we have some influence, and without influence it would not be
possible to serve the community.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I therefore determined the style of dress for my wife and children.
How could I like them to be known as Kathiawad Banias ? The Parsis
used then to be regarded as the most civilized people amongst
Indians, and so, when the complete European style seemed to be
unsuited, we adopted the Parsi style. Accordingly my wife wore the
Parsi sari, and the boys the Parsi coat and trousers. Of course no
one could be without shoes and stockings. It was long before my wife
and children could get used to them. The shoes cramped their feet and
the stockings stank with perspiration. The toes often got sore. I
always had my answers ready to all these objections. But I have an
impression that<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>it
was not so much the answers as the force of authority that carried
conviction. They agreed to the changes in dress as there was no
alternative. In the same spirit and with even more reluctance they
adopted the use of knives and forks. When my infatuation for these
signs of civilization<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>wore
away, they gave up<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>the
knives and forks. After having become long accustomed to the new
style, it was perhaps no less irksome for them to return to the
original mode. But I can see today that we feel all the freer and
lighter for having cast off the tinsel of ‘civilization’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
On board the same steamer with us were some relatives and
acquaintances. These and other deck passengers I frequently met,
because, the boat belonging to my client friends, I was free to move
about anywhere and everywhere I liked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Since the steamer was making straight for Natal, without calling at
intermediate ports, our voyage was of only eighteen days. But as
though to warn us of the coming real storm on land, a terrible gale
overtook us, whilst we were only four days from Natal. December is a
summer month of monsoon in the Southern hemisphere, and gales, great
and small, are therefore quite common in the Southern sea at that
season. The gale in which we were caught was so violent and prolonged
that the passengers became alarmed. It was a solemn scene. All became
one in face of the common danger. They forgot their differences   and
  began   to   think   of   the   one   and   only   God<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>—
Mussalmans, Hindus, Christians and all. Some took various vows. The
captain also joined the passengers in their prayers. He assured them
that, though the storm was not without danger, he had had experience
of many worse ones, and explained to them that a well-built ship
could stand almost any weather. But they were inconsolable. Every</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
minute were heard sounds and crashes which foreboded breaches and
leaks. The ship rocked and rolled to such an extent that it seemed as
though she would capsize at any moment. It was out of the question
for anyone to remain on deck. ‘His will be done’ was the only cry
on every lip. So far as I can recollect, we must have been in this
plight for about twenty-four hours. At last the sky cleared, the sun
made his appearance, and the captain said that the storm had blown
over. People’s faces beamed with gladness, and with the
disappearance of danger disappeared also the name of God from their
lips. Eating and drinking, singing and merry-making again became the
order of the day. The fear of death was gone, and the momentary mood
of earnest prayer gave place to  <i>maya</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>There were of course the usual  <i>namaz</i><font size="1">2
</font>and the prayers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7</font></sup>,
yet they had none of the solemnity of that dread hour.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But the storm had made me one with the passengers. I had little fear
of the storm,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>for
I had had experience of similar ones. I am a good sailor and do not
get sea-sick. So I could fearlessly  move amongst the passengers,
bringing them comfort and good cheer, and conveying to them hourly
reports of the captain. The friendship I thus formed stood me, as we
shall see, in very good stead.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The ship cast anchor in the port of Durban on the 18th or 19th of
December. The <i>Naderi </i>also reached the same day.</p>

We have seen that the two ships cast anchor in the  port  of Durban
on or about the 18th of December. No passengers are allowed to land
at any of the South African ports before being subjected to a
thorough medical examination. If the ship has any  passenger
suffering from a contagious disease, she has to undergo a period of
quarantine. As there had been plague in Bombay when we set sail, we
feared that we might have to go through a brief quarantine. Before
the examination every ship has to fly a yellow flag, which is lowered
only when the doctor has certified her to be healthy. Relatives and
friends of passengers are allowed to come on board only after the
yellow flag has been lowered.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Accordingly our ship was flying the yellow flag, when the  doctor
came and examined us. He ordered a five days’ quarantine because,
in his opinion, plague germs took twenty-three days at the most to
develop. Our ship was therefore ordered to be put in quarantine until
the twenty-third day of our sailing from Bombay. But</p>

this quarantine order had more than health reasons behind it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The white residents of Durban had been agitating for our
repatriation, and the agitation was one of the reasons for the order.
Dada Abdulla and Co.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>kept
us regularly informed about the daily happenings in the town. The
whites were holding monster meetings every day. They were addressing
all kinds of threats and at times offering even inducements to Dada
Abdulla and Co. They were ready to indemnify the Company if both the
ships should be sent back. But Dada Abdulla and Co. were not the
people to be afraid of threats. Sheth Abdul Karim Haji Adam was then
the managing partner of the firm. He was determined to moor the ships
at the wharf and disembark the passengers at any cost. He was daily
sending me detailed letters. Fortunately the late Sjt. Mansukhlal
Naazar was then  in  Durban having gone there to meet me. He was
capable and  fearless  and guided the Indian community. Their
advocate Mr. Laughton was an equally fearless man. He condemned the
conduct of the white resi- dents and advised the community, not
merely as their paid advocate, but also as their true friend.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus Durban had become the scene of an unequal duel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>On
one side there was a handful of poor Indians and a few of their
English friends, and on the other were ranged the white men, strong
in arms, in numbers, in education and in wealth. They had also the
backing of the State, for the Natal Government openly helped them.
Mr. Harry Escombe, who was the most influential of the members of the
Cabinet, openly took part in their meetings.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The real object of the quarantine was thus to coerce the passengers
into returning to India by somehow intimidating them or the Agent
Company.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>For
now threats began to be addressed to us also : ‘If you do not go
back, you will surely be pushed into the sea. But if you consent to
return, you may even get your passage money back.’ I constantly
moved amongst my fellow-passengers cheering them up. I also sent
messages of comfort to the passengers of the s.s. <i>Naderi</i>. All
of them kept calm and courageous.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We arranged all sorts of games on the ship for the entertainment of
the passengers. On Christmas Day the captain invited the saloon
passengers to dinner. The principal among these were my family and</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was conscious of my responsibility. I knew that Dada Abdulla and
Co. had incurred grave risks on my account, the lives of the
passengers were in danger, and by bringing my family with me I had
put them likewise in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I was absolutely innocent. I had induced no one to go to Natal. I
did not<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>know the passengers when they embarked. And with the
exception of a couple of relatives, I did not know the name and
address of even one of the hundreds of passengers on board. Neither
had I said, whilst in India, a word about the whites in Natal that I
had not already said in Natal itself. And I had ample evidence in
support of all that I had said.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I therefore deplored the civilization of which the Natal whites were
the fruit, and which they represented and championed. This
civilization had all along been on my mind, and I tharefore offered
my views concerning it in my speech before that little meeting. The
captain and other friends gave me a patient hearing, and received my
speech in the spirit in which it was made. I do not know that it in
any way affected the course of their lives, but afterwards I had long
talks with the captain and other officers regarding the civilization
of the West. I had in my speech described Western civilzation as 
being,  unlike the Eastern, predominantly based on force. The
questioners pinned me to my faith, and one of them—the captain so
far as I recollect—said to me :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Supposing the whites carry out their threats, how will you stand
by your principle of non-violence ?’ To which I replied : ‘I hope
God will give me the courage and the sense to forgive them and to
refrain from bringing them to law. I have no anger against them. I am
only sorry for their ignorance and their narrowness. I know that they
sincerely believe that what they are<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>doing today is right and proper. I have no reason
therefore to be angry with them.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
The questioner smiled, possibly distrustfully.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus the days dragged on their weary length. When the quarantine
would terminate was still uncertain. The Quarantine Officer said that
the matter had passed out of his hands and that, as soon as he had
orders from the Government, he would permit us to land.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At last ultimatums were served on the passengers and me. We were
asked to submit, if we would escape with our lives. In our reply the
passengers and I both maintained our right to land at Port Natal, and
intimated our determination to enter Natal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>at any risk.</p>

At the end of twenty three days<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

So the ships were brought into the dock and the passengers began to
go ashore. But Mr. Escombe had sent word to the captain that, as the
whites were highly enraged against me and my life was in danger, my
family and I should be advised to land at dusk, when the Port
Superintendent Mr. Tatum would escort us home. The captain
communicated the message to me, and I agreed to act accordingly. But
scarcely half an hour after this, Mr. Laughton came to the captain.
He said : ‘I would like to take Mr. Gandhi with me<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup>,
should he have no objection. As the legal adviser of the Agent
Company I tell you that you are not bound to carry out the message
you have received from Mr. Escombe.’ After this he came to me and
said somewhat to this effect : ‘If you are not afraid<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>,
I suggest that Mrs. Gandhi and the children should drive to Mr.
Rustomji’s house, whilst you and I follow them on foot.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I do not at all like the idea of your entering the
city like a thief in the night.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>I do not think there is any fear of anyone hurting
you. Everything is quiet now. The whites have all dispersed. But in
any case I am convinced that you ought not to enter the city
stealthily.’ I readily agreed. My wife and children drove safely to
Mr. Rustomji’s place. With the captain’s permission I went ashore
with Mr. Laughton. Mr. Rustomji’s house was about two miles from
the dock.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
As soon as we landed, some youngsters recognized me and shouted
‘Gandhi, Gandhi’. About half a dozen men rushed to the spot and
joined in the shouting. Mr. Laughton feared that the crowd might
swell and hailed a rickshaw. I had never liked the idea of being in a
rickshaw. This was to be my first experience. But the youngsters
would not let me get into it. They frightened the rickshaw boy out of
his life, and he took to his heels. As we went ahead, the crowd
continued to swell, until it became impossible to proceed  further. 
They first caught hold of Mr. Laughton and separated us. Then they
pelted me with stones, brickbats and rotten eggs. Someone snatched
away my turban, whilst others began to batter and kick me. I fainted
and caught hold of the front railings of a house and stood there to

my breath. But it was impossible. They came upon me boxing and
battering. The wife of the Police Superintendent, who knew me, hap-
pened to be passing by. The brave lady came up, opened her parasol
though there was no sun then, and stood between the crowd and me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4
</font></sup>This checked the fury of the mob, as it was difficult
for them to deliver blows on me without harming Mrs. Alexander.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Meanwhile an Indian youth who witnessed the incident had run to the
police station. The Police Superintendent Mr. Alexander<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>sent
a posse of men to ring me round and escort me safely to  my 
destination. They arrived in time. The police station lay on our way.
As we reached there, the Superintendent asked me to take refuge in
the station, but I gratefully<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>declined
the offer. ‘They are sure to quiet down when they realize their
mistake,’ I said. ‘I have trust in their sense of fairness.’
Escorted by the police, I arrived without fur-ther harm at Mr.
Rustomji’s place. I had bruises all over, but no abrasions except
in one place. Dr. Dadi Barjor, the ship’s doctor, who was on the
spot, rendered the best possible help.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
There was quiet inside, but outside the whites surrounded the house.
Night was coming on, and the yelling crowd was shouting, ‘We must
have Gandhi.’ The quicksighted Police Superintendent was already
there trying to keep the crowds under control, not by threats, but by
humouring them. But he was not entirely free from anxiety. He sent me
a message to this effect : ‘If you would save your friend’s house
and property and also your family, you should escape from the house
in disguise, as I suggest.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus on one and the same day I was faced with two cont- radictory
positions. When danger to life had been no more than imaginary, Mr.
Laughton advised me to launch forth openly. I acce- pted the advice.
When the danger was quite real, another friend gave me the contrary
advice, and I accepted that too. Who can say whether I did so because
I saw that my life was in jeopardy, or because I did not want to put
my friend’s life and property or the lives of my wife and children
in danger<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>? Who can say for certain that I was right both when I
faced the crowd in the first instance bravely, as it was said, and
when I escaped from it in disguise ?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup></p>

possible, to learn a lesson from them for the future. It is difficult
to say for certain how a particular man would act in a particular set
of circumstances. We can also see that judging a man from his outward
act is no more than a doubtful inference, inasmuch as it is not based
on sufficient data.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Be that as it may, the preparations for escape made me forget my
injuries. As suggested by the Superintendent,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I put on an Indian constable’s uniform and wore on
my head a Madrasi scarf, wrapped round a plate to serve as a helmet.
Two detectives accompanied me, one of them disguised as an Indian
merchant and with his face painted to resemble that of an Indian. I
forgot the disguise of the other. We reached a neighburing shop by a
by-lane and, making our way  through the gunny bags piled in the
godown, escaped by the gate of the shop and threaded our way through
the crowd to a carriage that had been kept for me at the end of the
street. In this we drove off to the same police station where Mr.
Alexander had offered me refuge a short time before, and I thanked
him and the detective officers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst I had been thus effecting my escape, Mr. Alexander had kept
the crowd amused by singing the tune :</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 2.03cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm">
‘<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Hang

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
When he was informed of my safe arrival at the police station, he
thus broke the news to the crowd. ‘Well your victim has made good
his escape through a neighbouring shop. You had better go home
now.‘<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Some of them were angry, others laughed, some refused
to believe the story.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Well then,‘ said the Superintendent, ‘if you do not believe
me, you may appoint one or two representatives, whom I am ready to
take inside the house. If they succeed in finding out Gandhi, I will
gladly deliver him to you. But if they fail, you must disperse. I am
sure that you have no intention of destroying Mr. Rustomji’s house
or of harming Mr. Gandhi’s wife and children.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The crowd sent their representatives to search the house. They soon
returned with disappointing news, and the crowd broke up at last,
most of them admiring the Superintendent’s tactful handling of the
situation, and a few fretting and fuming.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The late Mr. Chamberlain, who was then Secretary of State for the
Colonies,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10    </font></sup>cabled
asking the Natal Government to prosecute my assailants. Mr. Escombe
sent for me, expressed his regret for the injuries I had sustained,
and said : ‘Believe me, I cannot feel happy over the least little
injury done to your person. You had a right to accept Mr. Laughton’s
advice and to face the worst, but I am sure that,</p>

writings. I had given the interviewer all this literature and showed
him that in India I had said nothing which I had not already said in
South Africa in stronger language. I had also shown him that I had no
hand in bringing the passengers of the <i>Courland </i>and <i>Naderi
</i>to South  Africa. Many of them were old residents, and most of
them, far from wanting to stay in Natal, meant to go to the
Transvaal. In those days the Transvaal offered better prospects than
Natal to those coming in search of wealth, and most Indians,
therefore, preferred to go there.</p>

This interview and my refusal to prosecute the assailants produced
such a profound impression that the Europeans of Durban were ashamed
of their conduct. The Press declared me to be innocent and condemned
the mob. Thus the lynching ultimately proved to be a blessing for me,
that is, for the cause. It enhanced the prestige of the Indian
community in South Africa and made my work easier.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In three or four days I went to my house,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

it was not long before I settled down again. The incident added also
to my professional practice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But if it enhanced the prestige of the community, it also fanned the
flame of prejudice against it. As soon as it was proved that the
Indian could put up a manly fight, he came to be regarded as a
danger. Two bills were introduced in the Natal Legislative Assembly,
one of them calculated to affect the Indian trader adversely, and the
other to impose a stringent restriction on Indian immigration. Fort-
unately the fight for the franchise had resulted in a decision to the
effect that no enactment might be passed against the Indians as such,
that is to say, that the law should make no distinctions of colour or
race. The language of the bills above mentioned  made  them
applicable to all, but their object undoubtedly was to impose further
restrictions on the Indian residents of Natal.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The bills considerably increased my public work and made the
community more alive than ever to their sense of duty. They were
translated into Indian languages and fully explained, so as to bring
home to the community their subtle implications. We appealed to the
Colonial Secretary, but he refused to interfere and the bills became
law.</p>

Sheth Adamji Miyakhan had, in my absence, discharged his  duty with
great credit. He had increased the membership and added about £1,000
to the coffers of the Natal Indian Congress. The awakening caused by
the bills and the demonstration against the pas- sengers I turned to
good account by making an appeal for mem- bership and funds, which
now amounted to £5,000. My desire was to secure for the Congress a
permanent fund, so that it might procure property of its own and then
carry on its work out of the rent of the property.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2
    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>This
  was  my   first   experience   of   managing   a   public
institution. I placed my proposal before my co-workers, and they
welcomed it. The property that was purchased was leased out, and the
rent was enough to meet the current expenses of the Congress. The
property was vested in a strong body of trustees and is still there
today, but it has become the source of much internecine quarrelling
with the result that the rent of the property now accumulates in the
court.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
This sad situation developed after my departure from South Africa,
but my idea of having permanent funds for public institutions
underwent a change long before this difference arose.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>And
now after considerable experience with the many public institutions
which  I have managed, it has become my firm conviction that it is
not good to run  public  institutions   on   permanent   funds.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>A
  permanent   fund carries in itself the seed of the moral fall of
the institution. A public institution means an institution conducted
with the approval, and from the funds, of the public. When such an
institution ceases  to  have public support, it forfeits its right to
exist. Institutions maintained on permanent funds are often found to
ignore public opinion, and are frequently responsible for acts
contrary to it. In our country we experience this at every step. Some
of the so-called religious trusts have ceased to render any accounts.
The trustees have become the owners and are responsible to none. I
have no doubt that the ideal is for public institutions to live, like
nature, from day to day. The institution that fails to win public
support has no right to exist as such. The subscriptions that an
institution annually receives are a test of its popularity and the
honesty of its management; and I am of opinion that every instit-
ution should submit to that test. But let no one misunderstand me. My
remarks do not apply to the bodies which cannot, by their very
nature, be conducted without  permanent buildings. What I mean to say
is that the current expenditure shoud be found from subscriptions
voluntarily received from year to year.</p>

necessary for it. I can recollect times when I did not know what

EDUCATION OF CHILDREN</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
When I landed at Durban in January 1897, I had three children with
me, my sister’s son ten years old, and my own sons nine and five
years of age. Where was I to educate them ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I could have sent them to the schools for European children, but only
as a matter of favour and exception. No other Indian children were
allowed to attend them. For these there were schools established by
Christian missions, but I was not prepared to send my children there,
as I did not like the education imparted in those schools.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>For
one thing, the medium of instruction would be only English,  or 
perhaps incorrect Tamil or Hindi; this too could only have been
arranged with difficulty. I could not possibly put up with this and
other disadvantages. In the meantime I was making my own attempt to
teach them. But that was at best irregular, and I could not get hold
of a suitable Gujarati teacher.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was at my wit’s end. I advertised for an English teacher who
should teach the children under my direction. Some regular
instruction was to be given them by this teacher, and for the rest
they<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2 </font></sup>should
be satisfied with what little I could give them irregularly. So I
engaged an English governess on £7 a month. This went on for some
time, but not to my satisfaction. The boys acquired some knowledge of
Gujarati through my conversation and intercourse with them, which was
strictly in the mother-tongue. I was loath to send them back to
India, for I believed even then that young children should not be
separated from their parents. The education that children naturally
imbibe in a well-ordered household is impossible to obtain in
hostels. I therefore kept my children with me<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>.
 I  did  send  my  nephew  and elder son to be educated at
residential schools in India for a few months, but I soon had to
recall them. Later, the eldest son, long after he had come of age,
broke away from me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

These experiments were all inadequate. I could not devote to the
children all the time I had wanted to give them. My inability to give
them enough attention and other unavoidable causes prevented me from
providing them with the literary education I had desired, and all my
sons have had complaints to make against me in this matter. Whenever
they come across an M.A. or a B.A., or even a matriculate, they seem
to feel the handicap of a want of school education.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Nevertheless I am of opinion that, if I had insisted on their being
educated somehow at public schools, they would have been deprived of
the training that can be had only at the school of experience or from
constant contact with the parents<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.
I should never   have  been free, as I am today, from anxiety on
their score, and the artificial education that they could have had in
England or South Africa, torn from me, would never have taught them
the simplicity and the spirit of service that they show in their
lives today, while their artificial ways of living might have been a
serious handicap in my public work. Therefore, though I have not been
able to give them a literary  education either to their or to my
satisfaction, I am not quite sure, as I look back on my past years,
that I have not done my duty to them to the best of my capacity. Nor
do I regret not having sent them to public schools. I have always
felt that the undesirable  traits<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
 see today in my eldest son are an echo of my own undisciplined and
unf- ormulated early life. I regard that time as a period of
half-baked knowledge<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
  indulgence.   It   coincided   with   the   most   impr- essionable
years of my eldest son, and naturally he has refused to regard it as
my time of indulgence and inexperience<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">8</font></sup>.
He has on the contrary believed that that was the brightest period of
my life, and the changes, effected later, have been due to delusion
miscalled enlightenment. And well he might. Why should he not think
that my earlier years represented a period of awakening, and the
later years of radical change, years of delusion and egotism ? Often
have I been</p>

confronted with various posers from friends : What harm had there
been, if I had given my boys an academical education ?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

careers ?</p>

I do not think that there is much point in these questions. I have
come in contact with numerous students. I have tried myself or
through others to impose my educational ‘fads’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10

thereof. There are within my knowledge a number of young men today

But the ultimate result of my experiments is in the womb of the

of the history of civilization may have some measure of the
difference between disciplined<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

children through changes introduced by parents in their lives. The
purpose of this chapter is also to show the lengths to which a votary
of truth is driven by his experiments with truth, as also to show the
votary of liberty how many are the sacrifices demanded by that stern
goddess. Had I been without a sense of self- respect and satisfied
myself with having for my children the education that other children
could not get.,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
should have deprived them of the object-lesson in liberty and self
respect that I gave them at the cost of the literary training. And
where a choice has to be made between liberty and learning, who will
not say that the former has to  be preferred a thousand times to the
latter ?</p>

The youths whom I called out in 1920 from those citadels of

slaves will probably be able now to trace my advice to its source.</p>

My profession progressed satisfactorily, but that was far from
satisfying me. The question of further simplifying my life and of
doing some concrete act of service<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to my fellowmen had been con- stantly agitating me,
when a leper came to my door. I had not the heart to dismiss him with
a meal. So I offered him shelter, dressed his wounds, and began to
look after him. But I could not go on like that indefinitely. I could
not afford, I lacked the will<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to keep him always with me. So I sent him to the
Government Hospital for indentured labourers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I was still ill at ease. I longed for some humanitarian work of a
permanent nature. Dr. Booth was the head of the St. Aidan’s
Mission. He was a kind-hearted man and treated his patients free.
Thanks to Parsi Rustomji’s charities, it was possible to open a
small charitable hospital under Dr. Booth’s charge. I felt strongly
inclined to serve as a nurse in this hospital. The work of dispensing
medicines took from one to two hours daily, and<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I made up my mind to find that time from my
office-work, so as to be able to fill the place of a compounder in
the dispensary attached to the hospital. Most of my professional work
was chamber work, conveyancing and arbitration. I</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
of course used to have a few cases in the magistrate’s court, but
most of them were of a non-controversial character, and Mr. Khan, who
had followed me to South Africa and was then living with me,
undertook to take them if I was absent. So I found time to serve in
the small hospital. This meant two hours every morning, including the
time taken in going to and from the hospital. This work brought me
some peace. It consisted in ascertaining the patient’s complaints,
laying the facts before the doctor and dispensing the prescriptions.
It brought me in close touch with suffering Indians, most of them
indentured Tamil, Telugu or North India men.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The experience stood me in good stead, when during the Boer War I
offered my services for nursing the sick and wounded soldiers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The question of the rearing of children had been ever before me. I
had two sons born in South Africa, and my service in the hospital was
useful in solving the question of their upbringing. My independent
spirit was<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>a
constant source of trial. My wife and I had decided to have the best
medical aid at the time of her delivery, but if the doctor and the
nurse were to leave us in the lurch at the right moment, what was I
to do ? Then the nurse had to be an Indian. And the difficulty of
getting a trained Indian nurse in South Africa can be easily imagined
from the similar difficulty in India. So I studied the things
necessary for safe labour. I read Dr. Tribhuvandas’ book, <i>Ma- </i><i>n</i><i>e</i><i>
</i><i>Shikhaman</i>—Advice to a Mother—and I nursed both my<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>children
according to the instructions given in the book, tempered here and
there by such experience as I had gained elsewhere. The services of a
nurse were utilized—not for more than two months each time—
chiefly for helping my wife, and not for taking care of the babies,
which I did myself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The birth of the last child put me to the severest test. The travail
came on suddenly. The doctor was not immediately available, and some
time was lost in fetching the midwife. Even if she had been on the
spot, she could not have helped delivery. I had to see through the

enjoyed the general health that they do today, had I not studied the

never learns in after life what it does</p>

We now reach the stage in this story when I began seriously to think
of taking the  <i>brahmachary</i><i>a</i><i> </i>vow.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
  had  been  wedded  to  a monogamous ideal ever since my marriage,
faithfulness to my wife being part of the love of truth. But it was
in South Africa that I came to realize the importance of observing
<i>brahmacharya </i>even with respect to my wife. I cannot definitely
say what circumstance or what book it was, that set my thoughts in
that direction, but I have a recollection that the predominant factor
was the influence of Raychandbhai, of whom I have already written. I
can still recall a conversation that I had with him. On one occasion
I spoke to him in high praise of Mrs. Gladstone’s devotion to her
husband. I had read somewhere that Mrs. Gladstone insisted on
preparing tea for Mr. Gladstone even in the House of Commons, and
that this had become a rule in the life of this illustrious<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>couple,
whose actions were governed by regularity. I spoke of this<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
the poet, and incidentally eulogized conjugal love. ‘Which of the
two do you prize more,’ asked Raychandbhai, ‘the love of Mrs.
Gladstone for her husband as his wife, or her devoted service
irrespective of her relation to  Mr. Gladstone ? Supposing she had
been his sister, or his devoted servant, and ministered to him with
the same attention, what would you have said ? Do we not have
instances of such devoted sisters or servants ? Supposing you had
found the same loving devotion in a male servant, would you have been
pleased in the same way as in Mrs. Gladstone’s</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
case ? Just examine the view-point suggested by me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Raychandbhai was himself married. I have an impression that at the
moment his words sounded harsh, but they gripped me irresistibly. The
  devotion   of   a<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>servant   was,  I   felt,  a   thousand   times  
more praiseworthy than that of a wife to her husband. There was
nothing surprising in the wife’s devotion to her husband, as there
was an indissoluble bond between them. The devotion was perfectly
natural. But it required a special effort to cultivate equal devotion
between master and servant. The poet’s point of view began
gradually to grow upon me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
What then, I asked myself, should be my relation with my wife ? Did
my faithfulness consist in making my wife the instrument of my lust ?
So long as I was the slave of lust, my faithfulness was worth
nothing. To be fair to my wife, I must say that she was never the
temptress. It was therefore the easiest thing for me to take the vow
of <i>brahmacharya</i>, if only I willed it. It was my weak will or
lustful attachment that was the obstacle.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Even after my conscience had been roused in the matter, I failed
twice. I failed because the motive that actuated the effort was none
the highest. My main object was to escape having more children.
Whilst in England I had read something about contraceptives. I have
already referred to Dr. Allinson’s birth-control propaganda in the
chapter on Vege-tarianism. If it had some temporary effect on me, Mr.
Hill’s opposition to those methods and his advocacy of internal
efforts as opposed to outward means, in a word, of self-control, had
a far greater effect, which in due time came to be abiding. Seeing
therefore, that I did not desire more children I began to strive
after self-control. There was endless difficulty in the task. We
began to sleep in separate beds. I decided to retire to bed only
after the day’s work had left me completely exhausted. All these
efforts did not seem to bear much fruit, but when I look back upon
the past, I feel that the final resolution was the cumulative effect
of those unsuccessful strivings.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The final resolution could only be made as late as 1906. Satyagraha
had not then been started. I had not the least notion of its coming.
I was practising in Johannesburg at the time of the Zulu ‘Rebellion’
in Natal, which came soon after the Boer War. I felt that I must
offer my services to the Natal Government on that occasion<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.
The offer was accepted, as we shall see in another chapter. But the
work set me furiously thinking in the direction of self-control and
according to my wont I discussed my thoughts with my co-workers. It
became my conviction that procreation and the consequent care of
children were inconsistent with public service. I had to break up my</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
household at Johannesburg to be able to serve during the ‘Rebellion’.
Within one month of offering my services, I had to give up the house 
I had so carefully furnished. I took my wife and children to Phoenix
and led the Indian ambulance corps attached to the Natal forces.
During the difficut marches that had then to be performed, the idea
flashed upon me that if I wanted to devote myself to the service of
the community in this manner, I must relinquish the desire for
children and wealth and live the life of a <i>vanaprastha</i>—of
one retired from household cares.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The ‘Rebellion’ did not occupy me for more than six weeks, but
this brief period proved to be a very important epoch in my life. The
importance of vows grew upon me more clearly than ever before.  I
realized that a vow, far from closing the door to real  freedom,
opened it. Up to this time I had not met with success because the
will had been lacking, because I had had no faith in myself, no faith
in the grace of God, and therefore, my mind had been tossed on the
boisterous sea of doubt<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>.
I realized that in refusing to take a vow man was drawn into
temptation, and that to be bound by a vow was like a passage from
libertinism to a real monogamous marriage. ‘I believe in effort, I
do not want to bind myself with vows,’ is the mentality of weakness
and betrays a subtle desire for the thing to be avoided. Or where can
be the difficulty in making a final decision ? I vow to flee from the
serpent which I know will bite me, I do not simply make an effort to
flee from him. I know that mere effort may mean certain death. Mere
effort means ignorance of the certain fact that the serpent is bound
to kill me. The fact, therefore, that I could rest content with an
effort only, means that I have not yet clearly realized the necessity
of definite action. ‘But supposing my views are changed in the
future, how can I bind myself by a vow ’ Such a doubt often deters
us. But that doubt also betrays a lack of clear perception that a
particular thing must be renounced. That is why Nishkulanand has sung
:</p>

Where therefore the desire is gone, a vow of renunciation is the
natural and inevitable fruit.</p>

After full discussion and mature deliberation I took the vow in 1906.
I had not shared my thoughts with my wife until then, but only
consulted her at the time of taking the vow. She had no objection.
But  I had great difficulty in making the final resolve. I had not
the necessary strength. How was I to control my  passions?  The
elimination of carnal relationship with one’s wife seemed then a
strange thing. But I launched forth<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>with

of God.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As I look back upon the twenty years of the vow, I am filled with
pleasure and wonderment. The more or less successful practice of
self-control had been going on since 1901. But the freedom and joy
that came to me after taking the vow had never been experienced
before 1906. Before the vow I had been open to being overcome by
temptation at any moment. Now the vow was a sure shield against
temptation. The great potentiality of <i>brahmacharya </i>daily
became more and more patent to me. The vow was taken when I was in
Phoenix. As son as I was free from ambulance work, I went to Phoenix,
whence I had to return to Johannesburg. In about a month of my
returning there, the foundation of satyagraha was laid. As though
unknown to me, the <i>brahmacharya </i>vow had been preparing me for
it. Satyagraha had not been a preconceived plan. It came on
spontaneously, without my having willed it. But I could see that all
my previous steps had led up to that goal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
 had  cut  down  my  heavy household expenses at Johannesburg and
gone to Phoenix to take, as it were, the <i>brahmacharya</i><i> </i>vow.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The knowledge that a perfect observance of <i>brahmacharya </i>means
realization of Brahman, I did not owe to a study of the Shastras. It
slowly grew upon me with experience. The shastric texts on the
subject I read only later in life. Every day of the vow has taken me
nearer the knowledge that in <i>brahmacharya </i>lies the protection
of the body, the mind and the soul. For <i>brahmacharya </i>was now
no process of hard penance, it was a matter  of  consolation  and 
joy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3 </font></sup>Every
day<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>revealed
a fresh beauty in it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But if it was a matter of ever-increasing joy, let no one believe
that it was an easy thing for me. Even when I am past fifty six
years, I realize how hard a thing it is. Every day I realize more and
more that it is like walking on the sword’s edge, and I see every
moment the necessity for eternal vigilance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Control of the palate is the first essential in the observance of the
vow. I found that complete control of the palate made the observance
very easy, and so I now pursued my dietetic experiments not merely
from the vegetarian’s but also from the <i>brahmachari</i>’s
point of view. As the result of these experiments I saw that the
<i>brahmachari</i>’s food should be limited, simple, spiceless,
and, if possible, uncooked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Six years of experiment have showed me that the <i>brahmachari</i>’s
ideal food is fresh fruit and nuts. The immunity from passion that I
enjoyed when I lived on this food was unknown to me after I changed
that diet. <i>Brahmacharya </i>needed no effort on my part in South
Africa<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>when I lived on fruits and nuts alone. It has been a
matter of</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
very great effort ever since I began to take milk. How I had to go
back to milk from a fruit diet will be considered in its proper
place. It is enough to observe here that I have not the least doubt
that milk diet makes the <i>brahmacharya </i>vow difficult to
observe. Let no one deduce from this that all <i>brahmacharis </i>must
give up milk. The effect on <i>brahmacharya </i>of different kinds of
food can be determined only after numerous experiments. I have yet to
find a fruit-substitute for milk which is an equally good
muscle-builder and easily digestible. The doctors, <i>vaidyas </i>and
<i>hakims </i>have alike failed to enlighten me. Therefore, though I
know milk to be partly a stimulant, I cannot, for the time being,
advise anyone to give it up.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
As an external aid to <i>brahmacharya</i>, fasting is as necessary as
selection and restriction in diet. So overpowering are the senses
that they can be kept under control only when they are completely
hedged in on all sides, from above and from beneath. It is common
knowledge  that  they  are  powerless  without  food,   and   so  
fasting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6 </font></sup>undertaken
with a view to control of the senses is, I have no doubt, very
helpful. With some, fasting is of no avail, because assuming that
mechanical fasting alone will make them immune, they keep their
bodies without food, but feast their minds upon all sorts of
delicacies, thinking all the while what they will eat and what they
will drink after the fast terminates. Such fasting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>helps
them in controlling neither palate nor lust. Fasting is useful, when
mind co-operates with starving body, that is to say, when it
cultivates<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>a
distaste for the objects that are denied to the body. Mind is at the
root of all sensuality. Fasting, therefore,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>has
a limited use, for a fasting man may continue to be swayed by
passion. But it may be said that<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>extinction
of the sexual passion is as a rule impossible without fasting, which
may be said to be indispensable for the observance of <i>brahmacharya</i>.
Many aspirants after <i>brahmacharya </i>fail, because in the use of
their other senses they want to carry on like those who are not
<i>brahmacharis</i>. Their effort is, therefore identical with the
effort to experience the bracing cold of winter in the scorching
summer months. There should be a clear line between the life of a
<i>brahmachari </i>and of one who is not. The resemblance that there
is between the two is only apparent. The distinction ought to be
clear as daylight. Both use their eyesight, but whereas the
<i>brahmachari </i>uses it to see the glories of God, the other uses
it to see the frivolity around him. Both use their ears, but whereas
the one hears nothing but praises of God, the other feasts his ears
upon ribaldry. Both often keep late hours, but whereas the one
devotes them to prayer,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>the
other fritters them  away  in  wild  and wasteful mirth. Both feed
the inner man, but the one only to keep the temple of God in good
repair,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

poles apart, and the distance between them will grow and not diminish

<i>Bahmachary</i><i>a</i><i> </i>means control of<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T13
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>the
senses in thought, word and deed. Every day I have been realizing
more and more  the necessity for restraints of the kind I have
detailed above. There is no limit to the possibilities of
renunciation even as there is none to those of <i>brahmacharya</i>.
Such <i>brahmacharya </i>is impossible of attainment by limited
effort. For many<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T14</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>it
must remain only as an ideal. An aspirant after <i>brahmacharya </i>will
always be conscious of his short-comings, will seek out the passions
lingering in the inner- most recesses of his heart and will
incessantly strive to get rid of them. So long as thought is not
under complete control of the will, <i>brahma-charya </i>in its
fulness is absent. Involuntary thought is an affection of the mind,
and curbing of thought, therefore, means curbing of the mind which is
even more difficult to curb than the wind. Neverthe-less the
existence of God within makes even control of the mind possible.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T15
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Let
 no  one  think that it is impossible because it is difficult. It is
the highest goal, and it is no wonder that the highest effort should
be necessary to attain it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But it was after coming to India that I realized that such
<i>brahmacharya </i>was impossible to attain by mere human effort.
Until then I had been labouring under the delusion that fruit diet
alone would enable me to eradicate all passions, and I had flattered
myself with the belief<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T16</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

But I must not anticipate the chapter of my struggle. Meanwhile let
me make it clear that those who desire to observe <i>brahma-charya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T17

that life, than I began to cut down expenses. The washerman’s bill
was heavy, and as he was besides by no means noted for his

not daily, at least every alternate day. This meant a double expense,

used more starch than necessary, the iron had not been made hot
enough, and for fear of burning the collar I had not pressed it
sufficiently. The result was that, though the collar was fairly
stiff, the superfluous starch continually dropped off it. I went to
court with the collar on, thus inviting the ridicule of brother
barristers, but even in those days I could be impervious to ridicule.</p>

But I could not make my friends appreciate the beauty of self- help.
In course of time I became an expert washerman so far as my own work
went, and my washing was by no means inferior to laundry washing. My
collars were no less stiff or shiny than others.</p>

used it only on special occasions. One such occasion was the banquet
given in his honour by the Johannesburg Indians.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The scarf was creased and needed ironing. It was not

to try my art.</p>

to me ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
With this he narrated, with much joy, the story of the gift. I still
insisted, guaranteed good work, got his permission to iron it, and
won his certificate. After that I did not mind if the rest of the

The barber was not at fault in having refused to cut my hair. There
was every chance of his losing his custom, if he should serve black
men. We do not allow our barbers to serve our untouchable brethren. I
got the reward of this in South Africa, not once, but many times, and

from becoming angry.</p>

</font></sup>and I must not repeat the argument here. I invite the
curious to turn to those pages. Suffice it to say that my loyalty to
the British rule drove me to participation with the British in that
war. I felt that, if I demanded rights as a British citizen, it was
also my duty, as such, to participate in the defence of the British
Empire. I held then that India could achieve her complete
emancipation only<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The average Englishman believed that the Indian was a coward,
incapable of taking risks or looking beyond his immediate self-
interest. Many English friends, therefore, threw cold water on  my
plan. But Dr. Booth supported it whole-heartedly. He trained us in
ambulance work. We secured medical certificates of fitness for
service. Mr. Laughton and the late Mr. Escombe enthusiastically<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>supported

but said that our services were not then needed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I would not rest satisfied, however, with this refusal. Through the
introduction of Dr. Booth,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I called on the Bishop of Natal. There were many
Christian Indians in our corps. The Bishop was delighted with my
proposal and promised to help us in getting our services accepted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Time too was working with us. The Boer had shown more pluck,
determination and bravery than had been expected; and our services
were ultimately needed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Our corps was1,100 strong, with nearly 40 leaders. About three
hundred were free Indians and the rest indentured. Dr. Booth was also
with us. The corps acquitted itself well. Though our work was to be
outside the firing line, and though we had the protection of the Red
Cross, we were asked<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>at a critical moment to serve within the firing line.
The reservation had not been of our seeking. The authorities did not
want us to be within the range of fire. The situation, however, was
changed after the repulse at Spion Kop, and General Buller sent the
message that, though we were not bound to take the risk, Government
would be thankful if we would do so and fetch the wounded from the
field. We had no hesitation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and so the action at Spion Kop found us working within
the firing line. During these days we had to march from twenty to
twenty-five miles a day,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>bearing  the  wounded  on stretchers. Amongst the
wounded we had the honour of carrying soldiers like General Woodgate.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The corps was disbanded after six weeks’ service. After the
reverses at Spion Kop and Vaalkranz, the British Commanderin-in-
Chief abandoned the attempt to relieve Ladysmith and other places by
summary procedure, and decided to proceed slowly, awaiting
reinforcements from England and India.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Our humble work was at the moment much applauded, and the Indians’
prestige was enhanced. The newspapers published laudatory rhymes with

The Indian community became better organized. I got into closer touch
with the indentured Indians. There came a greate awake- ning amongst
them, and the feeling that Hindus, Mussalmans, Chris- tians,
Tamilians, Gujaratis and Sindhis were all Indians and children of the
same motherland took deep root amongst them.  Everyone believed that
the Indians’ grievances were now sure to be redressed. At the
moment the white man’s attitude seemed to be distinctly changed.
The relations formed with the whites during the war were of the
sweetest. We had come in contact with thousands of tommies. They were
friendly with us and thankful for being there to serve them. I cannot
forbear from recording a sweet reminiscence of how human nature shows
itself at its best in moments of trial. We were marching towards
Chievely Camp were Lieutenant Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts, had
received a mortal wound. Our corps had  the honour of carrying the
body from the field. It was a sultry day—the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
day of our march. Everyone was thirsting for water. There was a tiny
brook on the way where we could slake our thirst. But who was to
drink first? We had proposed to come in after the tommies had
finished. But they would not begin first and urged us to do so, and
for  a while a pleasant competition went on for giving precedence to
one another.</p>

It has always been impossible forme to reconcile myself to any one
member of the body politic remaining out of use. I have always been
loath to hide or connive at the weak points of the community or to
press for its rights without having purged it of its blemished.
Therefore, ever since my settlement in Natal, I had been endeavouring
to clear the community of a charge that had been levelled against it,
not without a certain amount of truth. The charge had often been made
that the Indian was slovenly in his habits and did not keep his house
and surroundings clean. The principal men of the community had,
therefore, already begun to put their houses in order, but house-
to-house inspection was undertaken only when plague was reported to
be imminent in Durban. This was done after consulting, and gaining
the approval of, the city fathers <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup>,
who had desired our co-operation. Our co-operation made work easier
for them and at the same time lessened our hardships, For whenever
there is an outbreak of epide- mics, the executive, as a general
rule, get impatient, take excessive measures and behave to such as
may have incurred their displeasure with a heavy hand. The community
saved itself from this oppression</p>

by voluntarily taking sanitary measures.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But I had some bitter experiences. I saw that I could not so easily
count on the help of the community in getting in to do its own duty,
as I could in claiming for it rights<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>.
At some places I met with insults, at others with polite
indifferences. It was too much for people to bestir themselves to
keep their surroundings clean. To expect them to find money for the
work was out of the  question. These experiences taught me, better
than ever before, that without infinite patience it was impossible to
get the people to do any work. It is the reformer who is anxious for
the reform, and not society, from which he should expect nothing
better than opposition, abhorrence and even mortal persecution  <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>.
Why may not society regard as   retrogression what the reformer holds
dear as life itself ?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Nevertheless the result of this agitation was that the Indian
community learnt to recognize more or less the necessity for keeping
their houses and environments clean. I gained the esteem of the
authorities. They saw that, though I had made it my business to
ventilate grievances and press for rights, I was no less keen  and
insistent upon self-purification.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was one thing, however, which still remained to be done,
namely, the awakening in the Indian settler of a sense of duty to the
motherland. India was poor, the Indian settler went to South Africa
in search of wealth, and he was bound to contribute part of his
earnings for the benefit of his countrymen in the hour of their
adversity. This the settler did during the terrible famines in 1897
and 1899.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>They contributed handsomely for famine relief, and more
so in 1899 than in 1897. We had appealed to Englishmen also for
funds, and they had responded well. Even the indentured Indians gave
their share to the contribution, and the system inaugurated at the
time of these famines has been continued ever since, and we know that
Indians in South Africa never fail to send handsome contributions to
India in times of national calamity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">

implications of truth at every stage.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

On my relief from war-duty I felt that my work was no longer in South

money-making.</p>

Friends at home were also pressing meto return, and I felt that I
should be of more service in India. And for the work in South Africa,
there were, of course, Messrs Khan and Mansukhlal Naazar. So I
requested my co-workers to relieve me. After very great difficulty my
request was conditionally accepted, the conditon being that I should
be ready to go back to South Arica if, within a year, the community
should need me. I thought it was a difficult conditon but the love
that bound me to the community made me accept it.</p>

me to the community was too strong to break. The voice of the people
is the voice of God, and here the voice of friends was too real to be
rejected. I accepted the condition and got their permission to go.</p>

What right had I to accept all these gifts ? Accepting them, how

remuneration? All the gifts, excepting a few from my clients, were
purely for my service to the community, and I could make no

helped me in my public work.</p>

but could find no solution. It was dificult for me to forgo gifts
worth hundreds, it was more difficult to keep them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
And even if I could keep <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>them, what about my children ? What about my wife ? They
were being trained to a life of service and to an understanding that
service was its own reward.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I had no costly ornaments in the house. We had been fast simplifying
our life. How then could we afford to have gold watches ? How could
we afford to wear gold chains and diamond rings ? Even then I was
exhorting people to conquer the infatuation for jewellery. What was I
now to do with the jewellery that had come upon me ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
I decided that I could not keep these things. I drafted a letter,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">
</font>creating a trust of them favour of the community and
appointing Parsi Rustomji and others trustees. In the morning I held
a consultation with my wife and children and finally got rid of the
heavy incubus.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I knew that I should have some difficulty in persuading my wife, and
I was sure that I should have none so far as the children were
concerned. So I decided to constitute them my attorneys.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The children readily agreed to my proposal. ‘We do not need these
costly presents, we must return them to the community, and should we
ever need them, we could easily purchase them,’ they said.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was delighted. ‘Then you will plead with Mother, won’t you ?’
I asked them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘Certainly,’ said they. ‘That is our business. She does not
need to wear the ornaments. She would want to keep them for us, and
if we don’t want them, why should she not agree to part with them
?’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
But it was easier said than done.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You may not need them,’ said my wife. ‘Your children may not
need them. Cajoled they will dance to your tune. I can understand
your not permitting me to wear them. But what about my daughters-
in-law ? They will be sure to need them. And who knows what will
happen tomorrow ? I would be the last person to part with gifts so
lovingly given.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And thus the torrent of argument went on, reinforced, in the end, by
tears. But the children were adamant. And I was unmoved.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I mildly put in: The children have yet to get married. We do not want
to see them married young. When they are grown up, they can take care
of themselves. And surely we shall not have, for our sons, brides who
are fond of ornaments. And if after all, we need to provide them with
ornaments, I am there. You will ask me then.’</p>

‘Ask you? I know you by this time. You deprived me of my ornaments,
you would not leave me in peace with them. Fancy you offering to get

And pray what right have you to my necklace?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But,’ I rejoined, ‘is the necklace given you for your service
or for my service?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I agree. But service rendered by you is as good as rendered by me.

slaved for them!’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These were pointed thrusts, and some of them went home. But I was
determined to return the ornaments. I somehow succeeded in extorting
a consent from her. The gifts received in 1896 and 1901 were all
returned. A trust-deed was prepared, and they were deposited with a
bank, to be used for the service of the community, according to my
wishes or to those of the trustees.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Often, when I was in need of funds for public purposes, and felt that
I must draw upon the trust, I have been able to raise the requisite
amount, leaving the trust money intact. The fund is still there,
being operated upon in times of need, and it has regularly
accumulated.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have never since regretted the step, and as the years have gone by,
my wife has also seen its wisdom. It has saved us from many
temptations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

So I sailed for home. Mauritius was one of the ports of call, and as
the boat made a long halt there, I went ashore and acquainted myself
fairly well with the local conditions.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

saloon for himself, and I had orders to take my opportunity of
speaking to him by travelling in his saloon for one stage. I,
therefore, went to the saloon and reported myself at the appointed
station. With him were Mr. Wacha, and Mr. (now Sir) Chimanlal
Setalvad. They were discussing politics. As soon as Sir Pherozeshah
saw me, he said, ‘Gandhi, it seems nothing can be done for you. Of
course we will pass the resolution you want. But what rights have we
in our own country ?   I believe that, so long as we have no power in
our own land, you cannot fare better in the Colonies.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was taken aback. Mr. setalvad seemed to concur in the view; Mr.
Wacha cast a pathetic <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>look at me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I tried to plead with Sir Pherozeshah, but it was out of the question
for one like me to prevail upon the uncrowned king of Bombay. I
contented myself with the fact that I should be allowed to move my
resolution.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You will of course show me the resolution,’ said Mr. Wacha, to
cheer me up. I thanked him and left them at the next stop.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So we reached Calcutta. The President was taken to his camp with
great <i>eclat </i>by the Reception Committee. I asked a volunteer 
where I was to go. He took me to the Ripon College, where a number of
delegates were being put up. Fortune favoured me. Lokamanya was put
in the same block as I. I have a recollection that he came a day
later.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And as was natural, Lokamanya would never be without his durbar. Were
I a painter, I could paint him as I saw him seated on his bed—so
vivid is the whole scene in my memory. Of the numberless people that
called on him, I can recollect today only one, namely the late Babu
Motilal Ghose, editor of the <i>Amrita </i><i>Bazar </i><i>Patrika</i>.
Their loud laughter and their talks about the wrongdoings of the
ruling race cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I propose to examine in some detail the appointments in this
camp. The volunteers were clashing against one another. You asked one
of them to do something. He delegated it to another, and he in his
turn to a third, and so on; and as for the delegates, they were
neither here nor there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I made friends with a few volunteers. I told them some things about
South Africa, and they felt somewhat ashamed. I tried to bring home
to them the secret of service. They seemed to understand, but service
is no mushroom growth. It presupposes the will first, and then
experience. There was no lack of will on the part of those good,
simple-hearted young men, but their experience <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>was nil. The Congress would meet three days every year
and then go to sleep. What</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
training could one have out of a three days’ show once a year ? And
the delegates were of a piece with the volunteers. They had no better
or longer training. They would do nothing themselves. ‘Volunteer,
do this,’ ‘Volunteer, do that,’ were their constant orders.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Even here I was face to face with untouchability in a fair measure.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>The
Tamilian kitchen was far away from the rest. To the Tamil delegates
even the sight of others, whilst they were  dining, meant pollution.
So a special kitchen had to be made for them in the College compound,
walled in by wicker-work. It was full of smoke which choked you. It
was a kitchen, dining-room, washroom, all in one—a close safe with
no outlet. To me this looked like a travesty of <i>Varnadharma</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>.
If, I said to myself, there was  such  untouchability between the
delegates of the Congress, one could well imagine the extent to which
it existed amongst their constituents. I heaved a sigh at the
thought.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was no limit to insanitation. Pools of water were every where.
There were only a few latrines, and the recollection of their stink
still oppresses me. I pointed it out to the volunteers. They said
point-blank: ‘That is not our work, it is the scavenger’s work.’
I asked for a broom. The man stared at me in wonder. I procured one
and cleaned the latrine. But that was for myself. The rush was so
great, and the latrines were so few, that they needed frequent
cleaning, but that was more than I could do. So I had to content
myself with simply ministering to myself. And the others did not seem
to mind the stench and the dirt.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But that was not all. Some of the delegates did not scruple to use
the verandahs outside their rooms for calls of nature at night. In
the morning I pointed out the spots to the volunteers. No one was
ready to undertake the cleaning, and I found no one to share the
honour with me of doing it. Conditions have since consi- derably
improved, but even today thoughtless delegates are not wanting who
disfigure the Congress camp by committing nuisance wherever they
choose, and all the volunteers are not always ready to clean up after
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I saw that, if the Congress session were to be prolonged, conditions
would be quite favourable for the outbreak of an epidemic.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So I went to him. He scanned me and said with a smile: ‘I can give
you only clerical work. Will you do it ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

‘That is the right spirit, young man,’ he said. Addressing the
volunteers who surrounded him, he added, ‘Do you hear what this
young man says ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Then turning to me he proceeded: ‘Well then, here is a heap of
letters for disposal. Take that chair and begin. As you see, hundreds
of people come to see me. What am I to do? Am I to meet them, or am I
to answer these busybodies inundating me with letters ? I have no
clerks to whom I can entrust this work. Most of these letters have
nothing in them, but you will please look them through. Acknowledge
those that are worth it, and refer to me those that need a considered
reply.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
I was delighted at the confidence reposed in me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sjt. Ghosal didnot know me when he gave me the work. Only later did
he enquire about my credentials.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I found my work very easy—the disposal of that heap of
correspon-dence. I had done with it in no time, and Sjt. Ghosal was
very glad. He was talkative. He would talk away for hours together.
When he learnt something from me about my history, he felt rather
sorry to have given me clerical work. But I reassured him: ‘Please
don’t worry. What am I before you? You have grown gray in the
service of the Congress, and are as an elder to me. I am but an
inexperienced youth. You have put me under a debt of obligation by
entrusting me with this work. For I want to do Congress work, and you
have given me the rare opportunity of understanding the details.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
‘To tell you the truth,’ said Sjt. Ghosal, ‘that is the proper
spirit. But young men of today do not realize it. Of course I have
known the Congress since its birth. In fact I may claim a certain
share with Mr. Hume in bringing the Congress into being.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And thus we became good friends. He insisted on my having lunch with
him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sjt. Ghosal used <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1 </font></sup>to
get his shirt buttoned by his bearer. I volunteered to do the
bearer’s duty, and I loved to do it, as my regard for elders was
always great. When he came to know this, he did not</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
mind my doing little acts of personal service for him. In fact he was
delighted. Asking me to button his shirt, he would say,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>‘You
see, now, the Congress secretary has no time even to button his
shirt. He has always some work to do.’ Sjt. Ghosal’s naivete
amused me, but did not create any dislike in me for service of that
nature. The benefit  I received from his service is incalculable.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In a few days I came to know the working of the Congress. I met most
of the leaders. I observed the movements of stalwarts like Gokhale
and Surendranath. I also noticed the huge waste of time there. I
observed too, with sorrow even then, the prominent place that the
English language occupied in our affairs. There was little regard for
economy of energy. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3 </font></sup>More
than one did the work of one, and many an important thing was no
one’s business at all.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Critical as my mind was in observing these things, there was enough
charity in me, and so I always thought that it might, after all, be
impossible to do better in the circumstances, and that saved me from
undervaluing any work.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>

In the Congress at last. The immense pavilion and the volunteers in
stately array, as also the elders seated on the dais, overwhelmed <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>me. I wondered<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>where I should be in that vast assemblage.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The presidential address was a book by itself. To read it from cover
to cover was out of the question. Only a few passages were therefore
read.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After this came the election of the Subjects Committee. Gokhale took
me to the Committee meetings.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sir Pherozeshah had of course agreed to admit my resolution, but I
was wondering who would put it before the Subjects  Com- mittee, and
when. For there were lengthy speeches to every resolution, all in
English to boot, and every resolution had some  wellknown leader to
back it. Mine was but a feeble pipe amongst those veteran drums, and
as the night was closing in, my heart beat fast. The resolutions
coming at the fag-end were, so far as I can  recollect, rushed
through at lightning speed. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>Everyone was hurrying to go. It was 11 o’clock. I had
not the courage to speak. I had already met Gokhale, who had looked
at my resolution. So I drew near his chair and whispered to him:
‘Please do something for me.’ He said: ‘Your resolution is not

The morning found me worrying about my speech. What was I to say in
five minutes ? I had prepared myself fairly well but the words would
not come to me. I had decided not to read my speech but to speak
extempore. But the facility for speaking that I had acquired in South
Africa seemed to have left me for the moment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
As soon as it was time for my resolution, Mr. Wacha called out my
name. I stood up. My head was reeling. I read the resolution
some-how. someone had printed and distributed amongst the dele- gates
copies of a poem he had written in praise of foreign emigration. I
read the poem and referred to the grievances of the settlers in South
Africa. Just at this moment Mr. Wacha rang the bell. I was sure I had
not yet spoken for five minutes. I did not know that the bell was
rung in order to warn me to finish in two minutes more. I had heard
others speak for half an hour or three quarters of an hour, and yet
no bell was rung for them. I felt hurt and sat down as soon as the
bell was rung.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

contained an answer to Sir Pherozeshah. There was no question about 
the  passing of the resolution. In those days there was hardly any
diference between visitors and delegates. Everyone raised his hand
and all resolutions passed unanimously. My resolution also fared in
this wise and so lost all its importance for me. And yet the very
fact that it was passed by the Congress was enough to delight my
heart. The knowledge that the <i>imprimatur </i>of the Congress meant

The Congress was over, but as I had to meet the Chamber of Commerce
and various people in connection with work in South Africa, I stayed
in Calcutta for a month. Rather than stay this time in a hotel, I
arranged to get the required introduction for a room in the India
Club. Among its members were some prominent Indians, and I looked
forward to getting into touch with them and interesting them in the
work in South Africa. Gokhale frequently went to this Club to play
billiards, and when he knew that I was to stay in Calcutta for some
time, he invited me to stay with him. I thankfully accepted the
invitation, but did not think it proper to go there by myself. He
waited for a day or two and then took me personally. He discovered my
reserve and said : ‘Gandhi, you have to stay in the country, and
this sort of reserve will not do. You must get into touch with as
many people as possible. I want you to do Congress work.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
I shall record here an incident in the India Club,  before  I proceed
to talk of my stay with Gokhale.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
Lord Curzon held his durbar about this time. Some Rajas and Maharajas
who had been invited to the durbar were members of the Club. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>In the Club I always found them wearing fine Bengali
dhotis and  shirts  and  scarves.  On  the  durbar  day  they  put 
on  trousers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2 </font></sup>befitting
<i>khansamas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>1   </i></font></sup>and
shining boots. I was pained and inquired of one of them the reason
for the change.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
‘We alone know our unfortunate condition. We alone know the insults
we have to put up with, in order that we may possess our wealth and
titles,’ he replied.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But what about these <i>khansama </i>turbans and these shining
boots?’ I asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Do you see any difference between <i>khansamas </i>and us?’ he
replied, and added, ‘they are our <i>khansamas, </i>we are Lord
Curzon’s <i>khansamas</i>. If I were to absent myself from the
levee, I should have to suffer the consequences. If I were to attend
it in my usual dress, it should be an offence. And do you think I am
going to get any opportunity there of talking to Lord Curzon? Not a
bit of it!’</p>

I was moved to pity for this plain-spoken friend. This reminds me of
another durbar.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
At the time when Lord Hardinge laid the foundation-stone of Hindu
University, there was a durbar. There were Rajas and Maharajas</p>

of course, but Pandit Malaviyaji specially invited me also to attend
it, and I did so.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was distressed to see Maharajas bedecked like women—silk pyjamas
and silk <i>achkans</i>, pearl necklaces round their necks, bracelets
on their wrists, pearl and diamond tassels on their turbans and,
besides all this, swords with golden hilts hanging from their
waist-bands.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I discovered <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3 </font></sup>that
these were insignia not of their royalty, but of their slavery. I had
thought that they must be wearing these badges of impotence of thier
own free will, but I was told that it was obligatory for these Rajas
to wear all their costly jewels at such functions. I also gathered
that some of them had a positive dislike for wearing these jewels,
and that they never wore them except on occasions like the durbar.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I do not know how far my information was correct. But whether they
wear them on other occasions or not, it is distressing enough to have
to attend viceregal durbars<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

MONTH WITH GOKHALE—I</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
From the very first day of my stay with him Gokhale made me feel
completely at home. He treated me as though I were his younger
brother, he acquainted himself with all my requirements and arranged
to see that I got all I needed. Fortunately my wants were few, and as
I had cultivated the habit of self-help, I needed very little
personal attendance. He was deeply impressed with my habit of fending
for myself, my personal cleanliness, perseverance and regularity, 
and would often overwhelm me with praise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He seemed to keep nothing private from me. He  would introduce me to
all the important people that called on him. Of these the one who
stands foremost in my memory is Dr. (now Sir) P. C. Ray. He lived
practically next door and was a very frequent visitor.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This is how he introduced Dr. Ray : ‘This is Prof. Ray who, having
a monthly salary of Rs. 800, keeps just Rs. 40 for himself and
devotes the balance to public purposes. He is not, and does not want
to get married.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I see little difference between Dr. Ray as he is today and as he used
to be then. His dress used to be nearly as simple as it is, with this
difference of course that whereas it is khadi now, it used to be <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>Indian mill-cloth in those days. I felt I could never
hear too much of the talks between Gokhale and Dr. Ray, as they all
pertained to public good or</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
were of educative value. At times they were painful too, containing,
as they did, strictures on public men. As a result, some of those
whom I had regarded as stalwart fighters began to look quite puny.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
To see Gokhale at work was as much a joy as an education. He never
wasted a minute. His private relations and friendships were all for
public good. All his talks had reference only to the good of the
country and were absolutely free from any trace of untruth or
insincerity. India’s poverty and subjection were matters of
constant and intense concern to him. Various people sought to
interest him in different things. But he gave every one of them the
same reply : ‘You do the thing yourself. Let me do my own work.
What I want is  freedom for my country. After that is won, we can
think of other things. Today that one thing is enough to engage all
my time and energy.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
His reverence for Ranade could be seen every moment. Rana- de’s
authority was final in every matter, and he would cite it at every
step. The anniversary of Ranade’s death (or birth, Iforget which)
occurred during my stay with Gokhale, who observed it regularly.
There were with him then, besides myself, his friends Prof. Kathavate
and a Sub-Judge. He invited us to take part in the celebrations and
in his speech<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>he gave us his reminiscences of Ranade. He compared
incidentally Ranade, Telang<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and Mandlik<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>.
He eulogized Telang’s charming style and Mandlik’s greatness as a
reformer. Citing an instance of Mandlik’s solicitude for his
clients, he told us an anecdote as to how once, having missed his
usual train, he engaged a special train so as to be able to attend
the court in the interest of his client. But Ranade, he said, towered
above them all, as a versatile genius. He was not only a great judge,
he was an equally great historian, an economist and a reformer.
Although he was a judge, he fearlessly attended the Congress, and
everyone had such confidence in his sagacity that they
unquestioningly accepted his decisions. Gokhale’s joy knew no
bounds, as he described these qualities of head and heart which were
all combined in his master.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Gokhale used to have a horse-carriage in those days. I did not know
the circumstances that had made a horse-carriage a necessity for him,
and so I remonstrated with him: ‘Can’t you make use of the tram-
car in going about form place to place? Is it derogatory to a</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Slightly pained, he said, ‘So you also have failed to understand
me! I do not use my Council allowances for my own personal comforts.
I envy your liberty to go about in tram-cars, but I am sorry I cannot
do likewise. When you are the victim of as wide a publicity as I am,
it will be difficult, if not impossible, for you to go about in a
tramcar. There is no reason to suppose that everything that the
leaders do is with a view to personal comfort. I love your simple
habits. I live as simply as I can, but some expense is almost
inevitable for a man like myself.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He thus satisfactorily disposed of one of my complaints,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>but there was another which he could not dispose of to
my satisfaction.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘But you do not even go out for walks,’ said I. ‘Is it
surprising that you should be always ailing? Should public work leave
no time for physical exercise?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘When do you ever find me free to go out for a walk?’ he replied.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had such a great regard for Gokhale that I never strove with him.
Though this reply was far from satisfying me, I remained silent. I
believed then and I belive even now, that, no matter what amount of
work one has, one should always find some time for exercise, just as
one does for one’s meals. It is my humble opinion that, far from
taking away from one’s capacity for work, it adds to it.</p>

I had told my Christian friends in South Africa that in India I would
meet the Christian Indians and acquaint myself with their condition.
I had heard of Babu Kalicharan Banerji and held hin in high regard.
He took a prominent part in the Congress, and I had none of the
misgivings about him that I had about the  average Christian Indian,
who stood aloof from the Congress and isolated himself from Hindus
and Mussalmans. I told Gokhale that I was thinking of meeting him. He
said: ‘What is the good of your seeing him? He is a very good man,
but I am afraid he will not satisfy you. I know him very well.
However, you can certainly meet him if you like.’</p>

dress, though I myself then wore a Parsi coat and trousers. Without

During these days I walked up and down the streets of Calcutta. I
went to most places on foot. I met Justice Mitter and Sir Gurudas
Banerji, whose I wanted in my work in South Africa. And about this
time I met Raja Sir Pyarimohan Mukarji.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Kalicharan Benerji had spoken to me about the Kali temple, which I
was eager to see, especially as I had read about it in the books. So
I went there one day. Justice Mitter’s house was in the some
locality, and I therefore went to the temple on the same day that I
visited him. On the way I saw a stream of sheep going to be
sacrificed to Kali. Rows of beggars lined the lane leading to the
temple. There were religious mendicants too, and even in those days I
was sternly opposed to giving alms to sturdy beggars. A crowd of them
pursued me. One of such men was found seated on a verandah. He
stopped me, and accosted me: ‘Whither are you going, my boy?’ I
replied to him.</p>

were greeted by rivers<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

I could not swallow this. I told him that, if the sheep had speech,
they would tell a different tale. I felt that the cruel custom ought

I hold today the same opinion as I held then. To my mind the life of
a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being. I should be
un-willing to take the life of a lamb for the sake of the human body.
I hold that, the more helpless a creature, the more entitled it is to
protection by man from the cruelty of man. But he who has not
qualified himself for such service is unable to afford to it any
protec- tion. I must go through<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

self-purification and sacrifice, before I can hope to save these
lambs from this unholy sacrifice. Today I think I must die pining for
this self-purification and sacrifice. It is my constant prayer that
there may be born on earth some great spirit, man or woman, fired
with divine pity, who will deliver us from this heinous sin, save the
lives of the innocent creatures, and purify the temple. How is it
that Bengal with all its knowledge, intelligence, sacrifice, and
emotion<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The terrible sacrifice offered to Kali in the name of religion en-
hanced my desire to know Bengali life. I had read and heard a good
deal about the Brahmo Samaj<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>. I knew something about the life of Pratap Chandra
Mazmudar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>. I
had attended some of the meetings ad- dressed by him. I secured his 
<i>Life</i><i> </i><i>of</i><i> Keshav Chandra </i><i>Sen</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>3
</i></font></sup>, read it with great interest, and understood the
distinction between Sadharan Brahmo Samaji and Adi Brahmo Samji. I
met Pandit Shivanath Shastri and in company  with Prof. Kathavate
went to see Maharshi Devendranath Tagore, but as no interviews with
him were allowedthen, we could not see him. We were, however, invited
to a celebration of the Brahmo Samaj held at his place, and there we
had the privilege of listening to fine Bengali music. Ever since I
have been a lover of Bengali music.</p>

was at his Calcutta house, lying ill, and could not be seen.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I then ascertained the place of residence of Sister Nivedita<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>, and met her in a Chowringhee mansion. I was taken
aback by  the splendour that surrounded her, and even in our
conversation, there was not much meeting ground. I spoke to Gokhale
about this, and he said he did not wonder that there could be no
point of contact between me and a volatile<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
  </font></sup>person like her.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I met her again at Mr. Pestonji Padshah’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>place.
I happened to come in just as she was talking to his old mother, and
so Ibecame an interpreter between the two. In spite of my failure to
find any agreement with her, I could not but notice and admire her
over flowing love for Hindusim. I came to know<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

I used to divide my day between seeing the leading people in Calcutta
regarding the work in South Africa, and visiting and studying the
religious and public institutions of the city. I once addressed a
meeting, presided over by Dr. Mullick, on the work of the Indian
Ambulance Corps in the Boer War. My acquaintance with <i>The
</i><i>Englishman </i>stood me in good stead on this occasion  too. 
Mr. Saunders was ill then but rendered me as much help as in 1896.
Gokhale liked this speech of mine, and he was very glad to hear Dr.
Ray praising it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus my stay under the roof of Gokhale made my work in Calcutta very
easy, brought me into touch with the foremost Bengali Families, and
was the beginning of my intimate contact with Bengal.</p>

month. Let me simply mention my flying visi <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>to Burma, and the <i>foongis</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>there.  I  was  pained  by  their  lethargy.   I  
saw  the   golden pagoda. I did not like the innumerable little
candles burning in the temple, and the rats running about the sanctum
brought to my mind thoughts of Swami Dayanand’s at Morvi.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>The freedom and energy of the Burmese women charmed
just as the indolence of the men pained me. I also saw, during my
brief sojourn, that just as Bombay was not India, Rangoon was not
Burma, and that just as we in India have become commission agents of
English merchants, even so in Burma have we combined with the English
merchants in making the Burmese people our commission agents.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
On my return from Burma I took leave of Gokhale. The separation was a
wrench, but my work in Bengal, or rather Calcutta, was finished, and
I had no occasion to stay any longer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Before settling down I had thought of making a <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>tour through India travelling third class, and of
acquainting myself with the hardships of third-class passengers. I
spoke to Gokhale about this. To begin with he ridiculed the idea, but
when I explained to him what I hoped to see, he cheerfully approved.
I planned to go first to Benares to pay my respects to Mrs. Besant,
who was then ill.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was necessary to equip myself anew for the third-class tour.
Gokhale himself gave me a metal tiffin-box and got it filled with
sweetballs and <i>puris</i>. I purchased a canvas bag worth twelve
annas and a long coat made of Chhaya<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>wool.
The bag was to contain this coat, a dhoti, a towel and a shirt. I had
a blanket as well to cover myself with and a water jug. Thus equipped
I set forth on my travels. Gokhale and Dr. Ray came to the station to
see me off. I had asked them both not to trouble to come, but they
insisted. ‘I should not have come if you had gone first class, but
now I had to,’ said Gokhale.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
No one stopped Gokhale from going on to the platform. He was in his
silk turban, jacket and dhoti. Dr. Ray was in his Bengali dress. He
was stopped by the ticket collector, but on Gokhale’s telling him
that he was his friend, he was admitted.</p>

not the time to see any more places than these. In each city I stayed
one day and put up in dharmsalas or with <i>pandas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>like the ordinary pilgrims, excepting at Palanpur. So
far as I can remember, I did not spend more than Rs. 31 (including
the train fare) on this journey.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In travelling third class I mostly preferred the ordinary to the mail
trains, as I knew that the latter were more crowded and the fares in
them higher.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The third-class compartments are practically as dirty, and the closet
arrangements as bad, today as they were then. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1

difference between the facilities provided for the first and the

</font></sup>out of all proportion to the difference between the
fares for the two classes. Third-class passengers are treated like
sheep and their comforts are sheep’s comforts. In Europe I
travelled third—and only once first just to see what it was
like—but there I noticed no such difference between the first and
the third classes. In South Africa third-class passengers are mostly
Negores, yet the third-class comforts are better there than here. In
parts of South Africa third-class compartments are provided with
sleeping accommodation and cushioned seats. The accommodation is also
regulated, so as to prevent overcrowding, whereas here I have found
the regulation limit usually exceeded. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The indifference of the railway authorities to the comforts of the
third-class passengers, combined with the dirty and  inconsiderate
habits of the passengers themselves, makes third-class travelling a
trial for a passenger of cleanly ways. These unpleasant habits
commonly include throwing of rubbish on the floor of the compartment,
smok- ing at all hours and in all places, betel and tobacco chewing
conver- ting of the whole carriage into a spittoon,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>shouting
and yelling, and using foul language, regardless of the convenience
or comfort of fellow-passengers. I have noticed little difference
between my experience of the third-class travelling in 1902 and that
of my unbroken third-class tours from 1915 to 1919.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I can think of only one remedy for this awful state of things— that
educated men should make a point of travelling third class and
reforming the habits of the people, as also of never letting the
railway authorities rest in peace, sending in complaints whereever
necessary, never resorting to bribes or any unlawful means for
obtaining their own comforts, and never putting up with infringements
of rules on the part of anyone concerned. This, I am sure, would
bring about consi-</p>

My serious illness in 1918-19 has unfortunately compelled me
practically to give up third-class travelling, and it has been a
matter of constant pain and shame to me, especially because the
disability came at a time when the agitation for the removal of the
hardships of third- class passengers was making fair headway. The
hardships of poor railway and steamship passengers, accentuated by
their bad habits, the undue facilities allowed by Government to
foreign trade, and such other things, make an important group of
subjects, worthy to be taken up by one or two enterprising and
persevering workers who could devote their full time to it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But I shall leave the third-class passengers at that, and come to my
experience in Benares. I arrived there in the morning. I had decided
to put up with a <i>panda. </i>Numerous Brahmins surrounded me as
soon as I got out of the train, and I selected one who struck me to
be comparatively cleaner and better than the rest. It proved to be a
good choice. There was a cow in the courtyard of his house and an
upper storey where I was given a lodging. I did not want to have any
food without ablution in the Ganges in the proper orthodox manner.
The <i>panda </i>made preparations for it. I had told him beforehand
that on no account could I give him more than a rupee and four annas
as <i>dakshina</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  and   that  he  should  therefore  keep  this  in 
mind  while making the preparations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The <i>panda </i>readily assented. ‘Be the pilgrim rich or poor,’
said he, ‘the service is the same in every case. But the amount of
<i>dakshina </i>we receive depends upon the will and the ability of
the pilgrim. I did not find that the <i>panda </i>at all abridged the
usual formalities in my case. The  <i>puja</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

I was deeply pained by what I saw there. When practising as a
barrister in Bombay in 1891, I had  occasion to attend a lecture on
‘Pilgrimage to Kashi’ in the Prarthana Samaj hall. I was
therefore prepared for some measure of disappointment. But the actual
disappointment was greater than I had bargained for.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The approach was through a narrow and slippery lane. Quiet there was
none. The swarming flies and the noise made by the shopkeepers and
pilgrims were perfectly insufferable.</p>

atmosphere in oneself. I did observe devout sisters, who were
absorbed in meditation, entirely unconscious of the environment. But
for this the authorities of the temple could scarcely claim any
credit. The authorities should be res-ponsible for creating and
maintaining about the temple a pure, sweet and serene atmosphere,
physical as well as moral. Instead of this I found a bazar where
cunning shopkeepers were selling sweets and toys of the latest
fashion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
When I reached the temple. I was greeted at the entrance by a
stinking mass of rotten flowers. The floor was paved with fine
marble, which was however broken by some devotee innocent of
aesthetic taste who had set it with rupees serving as an excellent
receptacle for dirt.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I went near the <i>Jnana-vapi </i>(well of knowledge). I searched
here for God but failed to find Him. I was not therefore in
particularly good mood. The surroundings of the <i>Jnana-vapi </i>too
I found to be dirty. I had no mind to give any <i>dakshina</i>. So I
offered a pie. The <i>panda </i>in charge got angry and threw away
the pie. He swore at me and said: ‘This insult will take you
straight to hell.’</p>
<p align="RIGHT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 105%">
This did not perturb me. ‘Maharaj,’ said I, ‘whatever fate has
in store for me, it does not behove one of your class to indulge in
such<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5 </font></sup>language.
You may take this pie if you like, or you will lose that too.’ ‘Go
away,’ he replied, ‘I don’t care for your pie.’ And then</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.41cm">
followed a further volley of abuse.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I took up the pie and went my way, flattering myself that the Brahmin
had lost a pie and I had saved one. But the Maharaj was hardly the
man to let the pie go. He called me back and said, ‘All right,
leave the pie here, I would rather not be as you are. If I refuse
your pie, it will be bad for you.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
I silently gave him the pie and, with a sigh, went away.</p>

Since then I have twice been to Kashi Vishvanath, but that has been
after I had already been afflicted with the title of Mahatma and
experiences such as I have detailed above had become impossible.
People eager to have my <i>darshan </i>would not permit me to have a

After this visit to the temple, I waited upon Mrs. Besant. I knew
that she had just recovered from an illness. I sent in my name. She
came at once. As I wished only to pay my respects to her, I said, ‘I
am aware that you are in delicate health. I only wanted  to  pay  my
respects. I am thankful that you have been good enough to receive me
in spite of your indifferent health. I will not detain you any

Gokhale was very anxious that I should settle down in Bombay,
practise at the bar and help him in public work. Public work in those
days meant Congress work, and the chief work of the institution which
he had assisted to found<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was  carrying  on  the  Congress  adminis- tration.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I liked Gokhale’s advice, <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>but I was not overconfident of success as a barrister.
The unpleasant memories of past failure were yet with me, and I still
hated as poison the use of flattery for getting briefs.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I therefore decided to start work first at Rajkot. Kevalram Mavji
Dave, my old well-wisher, who had induced me to go to England, was
there, and he started me straightaway with three briefs. Two of them
were appeals before the Judicial Assistant to the Political Agent in
Kathiawad and one was an original case in Jamnagar. This last was
rather important. On my saying that I could not trust myself to do it
justice, Kevalram Dave exclaimed: ‘Winning or losing is no concern
of yours. You will simply try your best, and I am of course there to
assist you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The counsel on the other side was the late Sjt. Samarth. I was fairly
well prepared. Not that I knew much of Indian law, but Kevalram Dave
had instructed me very thoroughly. I had  heard friends say, before I
went out to South Africa, that Sir Pherozeshah Mehta had the law of
evidence at his finger-tips and that was the secret of his success. I
had borne this in mind, and during the voyage had carefully studied
the Indian Evidence Act with commentaries thereon. There was of
course also the advantage of my legal experience in South Africa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I won the case and gained some confidence. I had no fear about the
appeals, which were succeesful. All this inspired a hope in me that
after all I might not fail even in Bombay.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
But before I set forth the circumstances in which I decided to go to
Bombay, I shall narrate my experience of the inconsiderateness and
ignorance of English officials. The Judicial Assistant’s court was
peripatetic. He was constantly touring, and <i>vakils </i>and their
clients had to follow him wherever he moved his camp. The <i>vakils
</i>would charge more whenever they had to go out of headquarters,
and so the clients had naturally to incur double the expenses. The
inconvenience was no concern of the judge.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The appeal of which I am talking was to be heard at Veraval where
plague was raging. I have a recollection that there were as many as
fifty cases daily in the place with a population of 5,500. It was
practically deserted, and I put up in a deserted dharmsala at some
distance from the town. But where the clients to stay? If they were
poor, they had simply to trust themselves to God’s mercy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
A friend who also had cases before the court had wired<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>that I should put in an application for the camp to be
moved to some other station because of the plague at Veraval. On my
submitting the application, the sahib asked me: ‘Are you afraid?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I answered: ‘It is not a question of my being afraid, I think I can
shift for myself, but what about the clients?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The plague has come to stay in India,’ replied the sahib. ‘Why
fear it ? The climate of Veraval is lovely. (The sahib lived far away
from the town in a palatial tent pitched on the  seashore.)  Surely
people must learn to live in the open.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was no use arguing against this philosophy. The sahib told his
<i>shirastedar</i>: ‘Make a note of what Mr. Gandhi says, and let
me know if it is very inconvenient for the <i>vakils</i><i> </i>or
the clients.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The sahib of course had honestly done what he thought was the right
thing. But how could the man have an idea of the hardships of poor
India? How was he to understand the needs, habits, idiosyncrasies and
customs of the people? How was one accustomed to measure things in
gold sovereigns, all at once to make calculations in tiny bits of
copper ? As the elephant is powerless to think in the terms of the
ant, in spite of the best intentions in the world, even so is the
English- man powerless to think in the terms of, or legislate for,
the Indian.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But to resume the thread of the story. In spite of my successes, I
had been thinking of staying on in Rajkot for some time longer when
one day Kevalram Dave came to me and said: ‘Gandhi, we will not
suffer you to vegetate here. You must settle in Bombay.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But who will find work for me there ?’ I asked. ‘Will you find
the expenses ?’</p>

‘Yes, yes, I will,’ said he. ‘We shall bring you down here
sometimes as a big barrister from Bombay and drafting work we shall
send you there. It lies with us <i>vakils </i>to make or mar a
barrister. You have proved your worth in Jamnagar and Veraval, and  I
 have therefore not the least anxiety about you. You are destined to
do public work, and we will not allow you to be buried in Kathiawad.
So tell me, then, when you will go to Bombay.’</p>

The money came in about two weeks, and I went to Bombay. I took

Though I had hired chambers in the Fort and a house in Girgaum, God
would not let me settle down. Scarcely had I moved into my new house
when my second son Manilal, who had already been through an acute
attack of smallpox some years back, had a severe attack of typhoid,
combined with pneumonia and signs of delirium at night.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The doctor was called in. He said medicine would have little effect,
but eggs and chicken broth might be given with profit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Manilal was only ten years old. To consult his wishes was out of the
question. Being his guardian I had to decide. The doctor was a very
good Parsi. I told him that we were all vegetarians and that I could
not possibly give either of the two things to my son. Would he
therefore recommed something else ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Your son’s life is in danger,’ said the good doctor. ‘We
could give him milk diluted with water, but that will not give him
enough nourishment. As you know, I am called in by many Hindu
families, and they do not object to anything I precribe. I think you
will be well advised not to be so hard on your son.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘What you say is quite right,’ said I. ‘As a doctor you could
not do otherwise. But my responsibility is very great. If the boy had
been grown up, I should certainly have tried to ascertain his wishes
and res- pected them. But here I have to think and decide for him. To
my mind it is only on such occasions that a man’s faith is truly
tested. Rightly or wrongly it is part of my religious conviction that
man may not eat meat, eggs, and the like. There sould be a limit even
to the means of keeping ourselves alive. Even for life itself we may
not do certain things. Reli-gion, as I understand it, does not permit
me to use meat or eggs for me or mine even on occassions like this,
and I must</p>

therefore take the risk that you say is likely. But I beg of you one
thing. As I cannot avail myself of your treatement, I Propose to try
some hydropathic remedies which I happen to know. But I shall not
know how to examine the boy’s pulse, chest, lungs etc. If you will
kindly look in from time to time examine and keep me informed of his
condition, I shall be grateful to you.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The good doctor appreciated my difficulty and agreed to my request.
Though Manilal could not have made his choice, I told him what had
passed between the doctor and myself and asked him his opinion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Do try your hydropathic treatment,’ he said. ‘I will not have
eggs or chicken broth.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This made me glad, though I realized that, if I had given him either
of these, he would have taken it.</p>

I knew Kuhne’s treatment and had tried it too. I knew as well that
fasting also could be tried with profit. So I began to give Manilal
hip-baths according to Kuhne, never keeping him in the tub for more
than three minutes, and kept him on orange juice mixed with water for
three days.</p>

I was haunted by toughts like these. Then a contrary current would
start. God would surely be pleased to see that I was giving<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the same treatement to my son as I would give myself.
I had faith in hydropathy, and little faith in allopathy. The doctors
could not guarantee recovery. At best they could experiment. The
thread of life was in the hands of God. Why not trust it to Him and
in His name go on with what I thought was the right reatment ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My mind was torn between these conflicting thougts. It was night. I
was in Manilal’s bed lying by his side. I decided to give him a wet
sheet pack. I got up, wetted a sheet, <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>wrung the water out of it and wrapped it about Manilal,
keeping only his head out and then covered him with two blankets. To
the head I applied a wet towel. The whole body was burning like hot
iron, and quite parched. There was absolutely no perspiration.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was sorely tired. I left Manilal in the charge of his mother, and
went out for a walk on Chaupati to refresh myself. It was about ten
o’clock. Very few pedestrians were out. Plunged in deep thoughts, I
scarcely looked at them. ‘My honour is in Thy keeping, oh Lord, in</p>

Manilal was restored to health, but I saw that the Girgaum house was
not habitable. It was damp and ill-lighted. So in consultation with
Shri Revashankar Jagjivan I decided to hire some well-ventilated

being the best from the point of view of sanitation.</p>

<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.41cm">
order to take the fast train from there direct to Churchgate.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I prospered in my profession better than I had expected. My South
African clients often entrusted me with some work, and it was <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font>enough to enable me to pay my way.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had not yet succeeded in securing any work in the High Court, but I
attended the ‘moot’ that used to be held in those days, though I
never ventured to take part in it. I recall Jamiatram Nanabhai taking
a prominent part. Like other fresh barristers I made a point of
attending the hearing of cases in the High Court, more, I am afraid,
for enjoying the soporific breeze coming straight from the sea than
for adding to my knowledge. I observed that I was not the only one to
enjoy this plesure. It seemed to be the fashion and therefore nothing
to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
However I began to make use of the High Court library and make fresh
acquaintances and felt that before long I should secure work in the
High Court.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus whilst on the one hand I began to feel somewhat at ease about my
profession, on the other hand Gokhale, whose eyes were always on me,
had been busy making his own plans on my behalf. He peeped in at my
chambers twice or thrice every week, often in company with friends
whom he wanted me to know, and he kept me acquainted with his mode of
work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But it may be said that God has never allowed any of my own plans to
stand. He has disposed them in His own way.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Just when I seemed to be settling down as I had intended, I received
an unexpected cable from South Africa: ‘Chamberlain expected here.
Please return immediately.’ I remembered my promise and cabled to
say that I should be ready to start the moment they put me in funds.
They promptly responded, I gave up the chambers and started for South
Africa.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

a year, so I kept the bungalow and left<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

that appears and happens about and around us is uncertain, transient.
But there is a Supreme Being hidden therein as a certainty, and one 
would  be blessed if one could catch a glimpse of that Certainty and

I reached Durban not a day too soon. There was work waiting for me.

Mr. Chamberlain had come to get a gift of 35 million pounds from
South Africa, and to win the hearts of Englishmen and <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1

‘You know,’ he said, ‘that the Imperial Government has little

genuine. I shall do what I can, but you must try your best to placate
the Europeans, if you wish to live in their midst.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The reply cast a chill over the members of the deputation. I was also
disappointed. It was an eye-opener for us all, and I saw that we
should start with our work <i>de novo</i>. I explained the situation
to my colleagues.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As a matter of fact there was nothing wrong about Mr. Cham- berlain’s

From Natal he hastened to the Transvaal. I had to prepare the case
for the Indians there as well and submit it to him. But how was I to
get Pretoria ? Our people there were not in a position to procure the
necessary legal facilities for my getting to them in time. The war
had reduced the Transvaal to a howling wildernes. There were neither
provisions nor clothing available. Empty or closed shops were there,
waiting to be replenished or opened, but that was a matter of time.
Even refugees could not be allowed to return until the shops were
ready with provisions. Every Transvaaler had therefore to obtain a
permit. The European had no difficulty in getting one, but the Indian
found it very hard.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
During the war many officers and soldiers had come to South Africa
from India and Ceylon, and it was considered to be the duty of the
British authorities to provide for such of them as decided to settle
there. They had in any event to appoint new officers, and these
experienced men came in quite handy. The quick ingenuity of some of
them created a new department. It showed their resourcefulness. There
was a special department for the Negroes. Why then should there not
be one for the Asiatics? The argument seemed to be quite plausible.
When I reached the Transvaal, this new department had already been
opened and was gradually spreading its tentacles. The officers who
issued permits to the returning refugees might issue them to all, but
how could they do so in respect of the Asiatics without the
intervention of the department ? And if permits were to be issued on
the recommendation of the new department, some of the responsibi-
lity and burden of the permit officers could thus be lessened. This
was how they had argued. The fact, however, was that the new
department wanted some apology for work, and the men wanted money. If
there had been no work, the department would have been found unneces-
sary and would have been discontinued. So they found this work for
themselves.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The Indians had to apply to this department. A reply would be
vouchsafed many days after. And as there were large numbers wishing
to return to the Transvaal, there grew up an army of intermediaries
or touts who, with the officers, looted the poor Indians to the tune
of thousands. I was told that no permit could be had without
influence</p>

and that in some cases one had to pay up to hundred pounds in spite
of the influence which one might bring to bear. Thus there seemed to
be no way open to me. I went to my old friend, the Police Superinten-
dent of Durban, and said to him : ‘Please introduce me to the
Permit Officer and help me to obtain a permit. You know that I have
been a resident of the Transvaal.’ He immediately put on his hat,
came out and secured me a permit. There was hardly an hour left
before my train was to start. I had kept my luggage ready. I thanked
Superinten- dent Alexander and started for Pretoria.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
I now had a fair idea of the difficulties ahead. On reaching Pretoria
I drafted  the  memorial.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>In  Durban  I  do  not  recollect  the Indians having
been asked to submit in advance the names of their representatives,

exclude me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

The officers at the head of the new department were at a loss to know
how I had entered the Transvaal. They inquired of the Indians who
used to go to them, but these could say nothing definite. The
officers only ventured a guess that I might have succeeded in
entering without a permit on the strength of my old connections. If
that was the case, I was liable to be arrested !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It is a general practice, on the termination of a big war, to invest
the Government of the day with special powers. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>This was the case in South Africa. The Government had
passed a Peace Preservation Ordinance,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>which   provided   that   anyone   entering   the  
Transvaal without a permit should be liable to arrest and
imprisonment. The question of arresting me under this provision was
mooted, but no one could summon up courage enough to ask me to
produce my permit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The officers had of course sent telegrams to Durban, and when they
found that I had entered with a permit, they were disappointed. But
they were not the men to be defeated by such disappointment. Though I
had succeeded in entering the Transvaal, they could still
successfully prevent me from waiting on Mr. Chamberlain.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

was of course in evidence everywhere in South Africa, but I was not
prepared to find here the dirty and underhand  dealing among
officials that I was familiar with in India. In South Africa the
public departments were maintained for the good of the people and
were responsible to public opinion. Hence officials in charge had a
certain courtesy of manner and humility about them, and coloured
people also got the benefit of it more or less. With the coming of
the officers from Asia, came also its autocracy, and the habits that
the autocrats had imbibed there. In South Africa there was a kind of
responsible government or democracy, whereas the commodity imported
from Asia was autocracy pure and simple; for the Asiatics had  no
responsible government, there being a foreign power governing them.
In South Africa the Europeans were settled emigrants. They had become
South African citizens and had control over the departmental
officers. But the autocrats from Asia now appered on the scene, and
the Indians in consequence found themselves between the devil and the
deep sea.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I had a fair taste of this autocracy. I was first summoned to see the
chief of the department, an officer from Ceylon. Lest I should appear
to exaggerate when I say that I was ‘summoned’ to see the chief,
I shall make myself clear. No written order was sent to me. Indian
leaders often had to visit the Asiatic officers. Among these was the
late Sheth Tyeb Haji Khan Muhammad. The chief of the office asked him
who I was and why I had come there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘He is our adviser,’ said Tyeb Sheth, ‘and he has come here at
our request.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Then what are we here for? Have we not been appointed to protect
you? What can Gandhi know of the conditions here?’ asked the
autocrat.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Tyeb Sheth answered the charged as best he could : ‘Of course you
are there. But Gandhi is our man. He knows our language and
understands us. You are after all officials.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Sahib ordered Tyeb Sheth to fetch me before him. I went to the
Sahib in company with Tyeb Sheth and others. No seats were offered,
we were all kept standing.</p>

I smarted under the insult, but as I had pocketed many such in the
past, I had become inured to them. I therefore decided to forget this
latest one and take what course a dispassionate view of the case
might suggest.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
We had a letter from the Chief of the Asiatic Department to the
effect that, as I had seen Mr. Chamberlain in Durban, it had been
found ncessary to omit my name from the Deputation which was to wait
on him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The letter was more than my co-workers could bear. They proposed to
drop the idea of the Deputation altogether. I pointed out to them the
awkward situation of the community.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘If you do not represent your case before Mr. Chamberlain,’ said
I, ‘it will be presumed that you have no case at all. After all,
the represen-tation has to be made in writing, and we have got it
ready. It does not matter in the least whether I read it or someone
else reads it. Mr. Chamberlain is not going to argue the matter with
us. I am afraid, we must swallow the insult.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had scarcely finished speaking when Tyeb Sheth cried out, ‘Does
not an insult to you amount to an insult to the community? How can we
forget that you are our representative?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Too true,’ said I. ‘But even the community will have to pocket
insults like these. Have we any alternative?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Come what may, why should we swallow a fresh insult? Nothing worse
can possibly happen to us. Have we many rights to lose?’ asked Tyeb
Sheth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
It was a spirited<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>reply, but of what avail was it? I was fully cons-
cious of the limitations of the community. I pacified my friends and
advi-sed them to have, in my place,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Mr. George Godfrey, an Indian barrister.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So Mr. Godfrey led the Dedputation. Mr. Chamberlain referred in his
reply to my exclusion. ‘Rather than hear the same representative
over and over again, is it not better to have someone</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
new?’ he said, and tried to heal the wound.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But all this, far from ending the matter, only added to the work of
the community and also to mine. We had to start afresh.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is at your instance that the community helped in the war, and
you see the result now,’ were the words with which some people
taun- ted me. But the taunt had no effect. ‘I do not regret my
advice,’ said</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
I. ‘I maintain that we did well in taking part in the war. In doing
so we simply did our duty. We may not look forward to any reward for
our labours, but it is my firm conviction that all good action is
bound to bear fruit in the end. Let us forget the pat and think of
the task before us.’ With which the rest agreed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I added : ‘To tell you the truth, the work for which you had called
me is practically finished. But I believe I ought not to leave the
Transvaal, so far as it is possible, even if you permit me to return
home. Instead of carrying on my work from Natal, as before, I must
now do so from here. I must no longer think of returning to India
within a year, but must get enrolled in the Transvaal Supreme Court.
I have confidence enough to deal with this new department. If we do
not do this, the community will be hounded out of the country, bes-
ides being thoroughly robbed. Every day it will have fresh insults
heaped upon it. The facts that Mr. Chamberlain refused to see me and
that the official insulted me, are nothing before the humiliation of
the whole community. It will become impossible to put up with the
veritable dog’s life that we shall be expected to lead.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
So I set the ball rolling, discussed things with Indians in Pretoria

It was indeed doubtful whether I would be enrolled in the Tra- nsvaal
Supreme Court. But the Law Society did not oppose my application, and
the Court allowed it. It was difficult for an Indian to secure rooms
for office in a suitable locality. But I had come in fairly close
contact with Mr. Ritch, who was then one of the merchants there.
Through the good offices of a house agent known to him, I succeeded
securing suitable rooms for my office in the legal quarters of the
city<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup>, and I
started on my professional work.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Up to now there had been in me a mixed desire. The spirit of
self-sacrifice was tempered by the desire to lay by something for the</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
future.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
About the time I took up chambers in Bombay, an American insurance
agent had come there—a man with a pleasing countenance and a sweet
tongue. As though we were old friends he discussed my future welfare.
‘All men of your status in America have their lives insured. Should
you not also insure yourself against the future? Life is uncertain.
We in America regard it as a religious obligation to get insured. Can
I not tempt you to take out a small policy?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Up to this time I had given the cold shoulder to all the agents I had
met in South Africa and India, for I had thought that life  assurance
implied fear and want of faith in God. But now I suc- cumbed to the
temptation of the American agent. As he proceeded with his argument,
I had before my mind’s eye a picture of my wife and children. ‘Man,
you have sold almost all the ornaments of your wife,’ I said to
myself. ‘If something were to happen to you, the burden of
supporting her and the children would fall on your poor brother, who
has so nobly filled the place of father. How would that become you?’
With these and similar argument I persuaded myself to take out a
policy for Rs. 10,000.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But when my mode of life changed in South Africa, my outlook changed
too. All the steps I took at this time of trial were taken in the
name of God and for His service. I did not know how long I should
have to stay in South Africa. I had a fear that I might never be able
to get back to India; so I decided to keep my wife and children with
me and earn enough to support them. This plan made me deplore the
life policy and feel ashamed of having been caught in the net of
insurance agent. If, I said to myself, my brother is really in the
position of my father, surely he would not consider it too much of a
burden to  support my widow, if it came to that. And what reason had
I to assume that death would claim me earlier than the others? After
all the real protector was neither I nor my brother, but the
Almighty. In getting my life insured I had robbed my wife and
children of their self- reliance. Why should they not be expected to
take care of themselves? What happened to the families of the
numberless poor in the world? Why should I not count myself as one of
them?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
A multitude of such thoughts passes through my mind, but I did not
immediately act upon them. I recollect having paid at least one
insurance premium in South Africa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Outward circumstances too supported this train of thought. During my
first sojourn in South Africa it was Christian influence that had
kept alive in me the religious sense. Now it was theosophical
influence that added strength to it. Mr. Ritch was a theosophist and</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
put me in touch with the Society at Johannesburg. I never became a
member, as I had my differences, but I came in close contact with
almost every theosophist. I had religious discussions with them every
day. There used to be readings from theosophical books and sometimes
I had occasion to address their meetings. The chief thing about
theosophy is to cultivate and promote the idea of brotherood. We had
considerable discussion over this, and I criticized the members where
their conduct did not appear to me to square with their ideal. The
criticism was not without its wholesome effect on me. It led to
introspection.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
When, in 1893, I came in close contact with Christian friends, I was
a mere novice. They tried hard to bring home to me, and make me
accept, the message of Jesus, and I was a humble and respectful
listener with an open mind. At that time I naturally studied Hinduism
to the best of my ability and endeavoured to understand other
religions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
In 1903 the position was somewhat changed. Theosophist friends
certainly intended to draw me into their society, but that was with a
view to getting something from me as a Hindu. Theosophical literature
is replete with Hindu influence, and so  these  friends expected that
I should be helpful to them. I explained that my Sam- skrit study was
not much to speak of, that I had not read the Hindu scriptures in the
original, and that even my acquaintance with the translations was of
the slightest. But being believers in samskara (tendencies caused by
previous births) and punarjanma (rebirth), they assumed that I should
be able to render at least some help. And so I felt like a Triton
among the minnows. I started reading Swami Vive- kananda’s Rajayoga
with some of these friends and M. N. Dvivedi’s Rajayoga with
others. I had to read Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras with one friend and
the Bhagavad Gita with quite a number. We formed a sort of Seekers’
Club where we had regular readings. I already had faith in the Gita,
which had a fascination for me. Now I realized the necessity of
diving deeper into it. I had one or two translations, by means of
which I tried to understand the original Samskrit. I decided also to
get by heart one or two verses every day. For this purpose I employed
the time of my morning ablutions. The operation took me thirty-five
minutes, fifteen minutes for the tooth brush and twenty for the bath.
The first I used to do standing in western fashion. So on the wall
opp- osite I stuck slipe of paper on which were written the Gita
verses and referred to them now and then to help my memory. This time
was found sufficient for memorizing the daily portion and recalling
the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
verses already learnt. I remember having thus committed to memory
thirteen chapters. But the memorizing of the Gita had to give way to
other work and the creation and nurture of  satyagraha,  which
absorbed all my thinking time, as the latter may be said to be doing
even now.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
What effect this reading of the Gita had on my friends only they can
say, but to me the Gita became an infallible guide of conduct. It
became my dictionary of daily reference.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Just
as  I  turned  to  the English dictionary for the meanings of English
words that I did not understand, I turned to this dictionary of
conduct for a ready solution of all my troubles and trials. Words
like aparigraha (non-possession) and samabhava (equability) gripped
me. How to cultivate and preserve that eqability was the question.
How was one to treat alike insulting, insolent and corrupt officials,
co-workers of yesterday raising meaningless opposition, and men who
had always been good to one? How was one to divest oneself of all
possessions? Was not the body itself possession enough? Were not wife
and children possessions? Was  I to destroy all the cupboards of
books I had? Was I to give up all I had and follow Him? Straight came
the answer : I could not follow Him unless I gave up all I had. My
study of English law came to my help. Snell’s discussion of the
maxims of Equity came to  my memory. I understood more clearly in the
light of the Gita teaching the implication of the word ‘trustee’.
My regard for jurisprudence increased, I discovered in it religion. I
understood the Gita teaching of non-possession to mean that those who
desired salvation should act like the trustee who, though having
control over great possessions, regards not an iota of them as his
own. It became clear to me as daylight that non-possession and
equability presuposed a change of heart, a change of attitude. I then
wrote to Revashankerbhai to allow the insurance policy to lapse and
get whatever could be recovered or else to regard the premiums
already paid as lost, for I had become convinced that God, who
created my wife and children as well as myself, would take care of
them. To my brother, who had been as father to me, I wrote explaining
that I had given him all that I had saved up to that moment, but that
henceforth  he  should  expect nothing from me, for future savings,
if any, would be utilized for the benefit of the community.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I could not easily make my brother understand this. In stern language
he explained to me my duty towards him. I should not, he said, aspire
to be wiser than our father. I must support the family as he did. I
pointed out to him that I was doing exactly what our father had</p>

My brother gave me up and practically stoped all commu- nication. I
was deeply distressed, but it would have been a greater distress to
give up what I considered to be my duty, and I pref- erred the
lesser. But that did not affect my devotion to him, which remained as
pure and great as ever. His great love for me was at the root of his
misery. He did not so much want my money as that I should be well-
behaved towards the family. Near the end of his life, however, he
appreciated my view-point. When almost on his death-bed, he realized
that my step had been right and wrote me a most pathetic letter. He
apologized to me, if indeed a father may apologize to his son. He
commended his sons to my care, to be brought up as I thought fit, and
expressed his impatience to meet me. He cabled that he would like to
come to South Africa and I cabled in reply that he could. But that
was not to be. Nor could his desire as regards his sons be fulfilled.
He died before he could start for South Africa. His sons  had  been
brought up in the old atmosphere and could not change their course of
life. I could not draw them to me. It was not their fault. ‘Who can
say thus far, no further, to the tide of his own nature?’ Who can
erase the impressions with which he is born? It is idle to expect
one’s children and wards necessarily to follow the same course of
evolution as oneself.</p>

As the ideals of sacrifice and simplicity were becoming more and more
realized, and the religious consciousness  was  becoming more and
more quickened in my daily life, the passion for vegetarianism as a
mission went on increasing. I have known only one way of carrying on
missionary work, viz., by personal example and discussion with
searchers for knowledge.</p>

There was in Johannesburg a vegetarian restaurant conducted by a
German who believed in Kuhne’s hydropathic treatment. I visited the
restaurant myself and helped it by taking English friends there. But
I saw that it could not last as it was always in financial
difficulties. I assisted it as much as I thought it deserved, and
spent some money on it, but it had ultimately to be closed down.</p>

a vegetarian restaurant on a grand scale. She was fond of art,
extravagant and ignorant of accounts. Her circle of friends was
fairly large. She had started in a small way, but later decided to
extend the venture by taking large rooms, and asked me for help. I
knew nothing of her finances when she thus approached me, but I took
it that her estimate must be fairly accurate. And I was in a position
to accommodate her. My clients used to keep large sums as deposits
with me. Having received the consent of one of these clients, I lent
about a thousand pounds from the amount to his credit. This client
was most large-hearted and trusting. He had originally come to South
Africa as an indentured labourer. He said : ‘Give away the money,
if you like. I know nothing in these matters. I only know you.’ His
name  was  Badri. He afterwards took a prominent part in satyagraha,
and suffered imprisonmentas well. So I advanced the loan assuming
that this consent was enough.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In two or three months’ time I came to know that the amount would
not be recovered. I could ill afford to sustain such a loss. There
were many other purposes to which I could have applied this amount.
The loan was never repaid. But how could trusting Badri be allowed to
suffer? He had known me only. I made good the loss.</p>

A client friend to whom I spoke about this transaction sweetly chid

‘Bhai,‘—I had fortunately not yet become ‘Mahatma’, nor

 used  to  call  me  by  the  loving  name  of ‘Bhai’
(brother)—said he, ‘this was not for you to do. We depend upon
you in so many things. You are not going to get back this amount. I
know you will never allow Badri to come to grief, for you will pay
him out of your pocket, but if you go on helping your reform schemes
by operating on your clients’ money, the poor  fellows will be
ruined, and you will soon become a beggar. But you are our trustee
and must know that, if you become a beggar, all our public work will
come to a stop.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup></p>

The friend, I am thankful to say, is still alive. I have not yet come
across a purer man than he, in South Africa or anywhere else. I have
known him to apologize to people and to cleanse himself, when, having
happened to suspect them, he had found his suspicion to be unfounded.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I saw that he had rightly warned me. For though I made good Badri’s
loss, I should not have been able to meet any similar loss and should
have been driven to incur debt—a thing I have never done in my life
and always abhorred. I realized that even a man’s reforming zeal
ought not to make him exceed his limits. I also saw that in thus</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
With the growing simplicity of my life, my dislike for medicines
steadily increased. While practising in Durban, I suffered for some
time from debility and rheumatic inflammation. Dr. P. J. Mehta, who
had come to see me<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>,
gave me treatment, and I got well. After that, up to the time when I
returned to India, I do not remember having suffered from an ailment
to speak of.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I used to be troubled with constipation and frequent headaches,
while at Johannesburg. I kept myself fit with occasional laxatives
and a well-regulated diet. But I could hardly call myself healthy,
and always wondered when I should get  free from  the incubus of
these laxative medicines.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
About this time I read of the formation of a ‘No Breakfast As-
sociation’ in Manchester. The argument of the promoters was that
Englishmen ate too often and too much, that their doctors’ bills
were heavy because they ate until midnight, and that they should at
least give up breakfast, if they wanted to improve this state of
affairs. Though all these things could not be said of me, I felt that
the  argument did partly apply in my case. I used to have three
square meals daily in addition to afternoon tea. I was never a spare
eater and enjoyed as many delicacies as could be had with a
vegetarian and spiceless diet. I scarcely ever got up before six or
seven. I therefore argued that, if I also dropped the morning
breakfast, I might become free from headaches. So I tried the
experiment. For a few days it was rather hard, but the headache
entirely disappeared. This led me to conclude that I was eating more
than I needed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But the change was far from relieving me of constipation. I tried
Kuhne’s hip-baths, which gave some relief but did not com- pletly
cure me. In the meantime the German who had a vege- tarian
restaurant, or some other friend, I forget who, placed in my hands
Just’s Return to Nature. In this book I read about earth treat-
ment. The author also advocated fresh fruit and nuts as the natural
diet of man. I did not at once take to the exclusive fruit diet, but
immediately began experiments in earth treatment, and with wonderful
results. The treatment consisted in applying to the abdomen a bandage
of clean earth moistened with cold water and spread like a poultice
on fine<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2 </font></sup>linen.
This I applied at bed-time, removing it during the night or in</p>

the morning, whenever I happened to wake up. It proved a radical
cure. Since then I have tried the treatment on myself and my friends
and never had reason to regret it. In India I have not been able to
try this treatment with equal confidence. For one thing, I have never
had time to settle down in one place to conduct the experiments. But
my faith in the earth and water treatment remains practically the
same as before. Even today I give myself the earth treatment to a 
certain extent and recommend it to my co-workers, whenever occasion
arises.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Though I have had two serious illnesses in my life, I believe that
man has little need to drug himself. 999 cases out of a thousand can
be brought round by means of a well-regulated diet, water and earth
treatment and similar household remedies. He who runs to the doctor,
vaidya or hakim for every little ailment, and swallows all kinds of
vegetable and mineral drugs, not only curtails his life, but, by 
becoming the slave of his body instead of remaining its master, loses
self-control, and ceases to be a man.</p>

Let no one discount these observations because they are being written

I know the reasons for my illnesses. I am fully conscious that I

consciousness that I have not lost patience. In fact I have thanked
God for them as lessons and successfully resisted the temptation of
taking numerous drugs. I know my obstinacy often tries my doctors,
but they kindly bear with me and do not give me up.</p>

However, I must not digrees. Before proceeding futrther,  I should
give the reader a word of warning. Those who purchase Just’s book
on the strength of this chapter should not take everything in it to
be gospel truth. A writer almost always presents one aspect of a
case, whereas every case can be seen from no less than seven points
of view, all of which are probably correct by themselves, but not
correct at the same time and in the same circumstances. And then many
books are written with a view to gaining customers and earning name
and fame. Let those, therefore, who read such books as these do so
with discernment, and take advice of some experienced man before
trying any of the experiments set forth, or let them read the books
with patience and digest them thoroughly before acting upon them.</p>

been able to understand. I was written for the benefit of the readers
of Indian Opinion. But I know that the booklet has profoundly
influenced the lives of many, both in the East and in the West,  who 
have  never  seen  Indian  Opinion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

have made certain radical changes in my actual practice, of which all
readers of the book do not know, and of which, I think, they should
be informed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The booklet was written, like all my other writings, with a spiritual
end, which has always inspired every one of my actions, and therefore
it is a matter for deep distress<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

theories propounded in the book.</p>

It is my firm conviction that man need take no milk at all, beyond
the mother’s milk that he takes as a baby. His diet should consist
of nothing but sunbaked fruits and nuts. He  can  secure  enough
nourishment both for the tissues and the nerves from fruits like
grapes and nuts like almonds. Restraint of the sexual and other
passions becomes easy for a man who lives on such food. My co-
workers and I have seen by experience that there is much truth in the
Indian proverb that as a man eats, so shall he become. These views
have been set out elaborately in the book.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
But unfortunately in India I have found myself obliged to deny some
of my theories in practice. Whilst I was engaged on the recruiting
campaign in Kheda, an error in diet laid me low, and I was at death’s
door.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

body in experimenting on these, but nothing could help me to leave
the sick-bed. The vaidyas read verses to me from Charaka to show that
religious scruples about diet have no place in therapeutics. So they
could not be expected to help me to continue to life without milk.
And how could those who recommended beef-tea and brandy without
hesitation help me to persvere with a milkless diet?</p>

I might not take cow’s or buffalo’s milk, as I was bound by a
vow. The vow of course meant the giving up of all milks, but as I had
mother cow’s and mother buffalo’s only in mind when I took the
vow, and was I wanted to live, I somehow beguiled myself into
emphasizing the letter of the vow and decided to take goat’s milk.
I was fully conscious, when I started taking mother goat’s milk,
that the spirit of my vow was destroyed. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

But the idea of leading a campaign against the Rowlatt Act had
possessed me. And with it grew the desire to live. Consequently one
of the greatest experiments in my life came to a stop.</p>

I know it is argued that the soul has nothing to do with what one
eats or drinks, as the soul neither eats nor drinks; that it is not
what you put inside from without, but what you express outwardly from
within, that matters. There is, no doubt, some force in this. But
rather than examine this reasoning. I shall content myself with
merely declaring my firm conviction that, for the seeker who would
live in fear of God and who would see Him face to face, restraint in
diet both as to quantity and quality is as essential as restraint in
thought and speech.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>

In a matter, however, where my theory has failed me, I should not
only give the information, but issue a grave warning against adopting
it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I would therefore urge those who, on the strength of
the theory propounded by me, may have given up milk, not to persist
in the experiment, unless they find it beneficial in every way, or
unless they are advised by experienced physicians. Up to now my
experience here has shown me that for those with a weak digestion and
for those who are confined to bed there is no light and nourishing
diet equal to that of milk.</p>

To turn now to the Asiatic Department.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Johannesburg was the stronghold of the Asiatic officers. I had been
observing that, far from proteching the Indians, Chinese and others,
these officers were grinding them down. Every day I had complaints
like this : ‘The rightful ones are not admitted, whilst those who
have no right are smuggled in on payment of £100. If you will not
remedy this state of things, who will?’ I shared the feeling. If I
did not succeed in stamping out this evil, I should be living in  the
Transvaal in vain.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So I began to collect evidence, and as soon as I had gathered a fair
amount, I approached the Police Commissioner. He appeared to be a <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1
</font></sup>just man. Far from giving me the cold shoulder, he
listened to me patiently and asked me to show him all the evidence in
my possession. He examined the witnesses himself and was satisfied,
but he knew as well as I that it was difficult in South Africa to get
a white jury to convict a white offender against coloured men. ‘But,’
said he, ‘let us try at any rate. It is not proper either, to let
such criminals go scot-free for fear of the jury acquiting them. I
must get them arrested. I assure you I shall leave no stone
unturned.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I did not need the assurance. I suspected quite a number of officers,
but as I had no unchallengeable evidence against them all, warrants
of arrest were issued against the two about whose guilt I had not the
slightest doubt.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
My movements could never be kept secret. Many knew that I was going
to the Police Commissioner practically daily. The two officers
against whom warrants had been issued had spies more or less
efficient. They used to patrol my office and report my movements to
the officers. I must admit, however, that these officers were so bad
that they could not have had many spies. Had the Indians and the
Chinese not helped me, they would never have been arrested.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One of these absconded. The Police Commissioner obtained an
extradition warrant against him and got him arrested and brought to
the Transvaal. They were tried, and although there  was  strong
evidence against them, and in spite of the fact that the jury had 
evidence of one of them having absconded, both were declared to be
not guilty and acquitted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was sorely disappointed. The Police Commissioner also was very
sorry. I got disgusted with the legal profession. The very intellect
became an abomination to me inasmuch as it could be prostituted for</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
screening crime.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
However, the guilt of both these officers was so patent that in spite
of their acquittal the Government could not harbour them. Both were
cashiered, and the Asiatic Department became comparatively clean, and
the Indian community was somewhat reassured.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The event enhanced my prestige and brought me more business. The
bulk, though not all, of the hundreds of pounds that the community
was monthly squandering in peculation, was saved. All could not be
saved, for the deshonest still plied their trade. But it was now
possible for the honest man to preserve his honesty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I must say that, though these officers were so bad, I had nothing
against them personally. They were of this themselves, and when in
their straits they approached me, I helped them too. They had a 
chance of getting employed by the Johannesburg Municipality in case 
I did not oppose the proposal. A friend of theirs saw me in this
connection and I agreed not to thwart them<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>,
and they succeeded.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This attitude of mine put the officials with whom I came in contact
perfectly at ease, and though I had often to fight with their
department and use strong language, they remained quite friendly with
me. I was not then quite conscious that such behaviour was part of my
nature. I learnt later that it was an essential part of satyagraha,
and an attribute of ahimsa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Man and his deed are two distinct things. Whereas a good deed should
call forth approbation and a wicked deed disapprobation, the doer of
the deed, whether good or wicked, always deserves respect of pity as
the case may be. “Hate the sin and not the sinner’ is a precept
which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practised, and
that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This ahimsa is the basis of the search for truth. I am rea- lizing
every day that the search is vain unless it is founded on ahimsa as
the basis. It is quite proper to resist and attack a system, but to
resist and attack its author is tantamount to resisting and attacking
oneself. For we are all tarred with the same brush, and are children
of one and the same Creater, and as such the divine powers within us
are infinite. To slight a single human being is to slight those
divine powers, and thus to harm not only that being but with him the
whole world.</p>

A variety of incidents in my life have conspired to bring me in close
contact with people of many creeds and many cummunities, and my
experience with all of them warrants the statement that I have known
no distinction between relatives and strangers, countrymen and</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
foreigners, white and coloured, Hindus and Indians of other faiths,
whether Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians or Jews. I may say that my
heart has been incapable of making any such distinctions. I cannot
claim this as a special virtue, as it is in my very nature, rather
than a result of any effort on my part, whereas in the case of ahimsa
(non- violence), brahmacharya (celibacy), aparigraha (non-possession)
and other cardinal virtues, I am fully conscious of a continuous
striving for their cultivation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
When I was practising in Durban, my office clerks often stayed with
me, and there were among them Hindus and Christians, or to describe
them by their provinces, Gujaratis and Tamilians. I do not recollect
having ever regarded them as anything but my kith and kin. I treated
them as members of my family, and had unpleasantness with my wife if
ever she stood in the way of my treating them as such. One of the
clerks was a Christian, born of Panchama parents.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The house was built after the Western model and the rooms rightly had
no outlets for dirty water. Each room had therefore chamber-pots.
Rather than have these cleaned by a servant or a sweeper, my wife or
I attended to them. The clerks who made themselves completely at home
would naturally clean their own pots, but the Christian<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>clerk
was a newcomer, and it was our duty to attend to his bedroom. My wife
managed the pots of the others, but to clean those used by one who
had been a Panchama<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>seemed
to her to be the limit, and we fell out. She could not bear the pots
being cleaned by me, neither did she like doing it herself. Even
today I can recall the picture of her chiding me, her eyes red with
anger, and pearl drops streaming down her cheeks, as she descended
the ladder, pot in hand. But I was a cruelly kind<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>husband.

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>regarded
myself as her teacher, and so harassed her out of my blind love for
her.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I was far from being satisfied by her merely carrying the pot. I
would have her do it cheerfully. So I said, raising my voice : ‘I
will not stand this nonsense in my house.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
The words pierced her like an arrow.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
She shouted back : ‘Keep your house to yourself and let me go.’ I
forgot myself, and the spring of compassion dried up in me<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>.
I caught her by the hand, dragged the helpless woman to the gate, 
which was just opposite the ladder, and proceeded to open it with the
intention  of  pushing  her  out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>The
 tears  were  running  down  her cheeks in torrents, and she cried :

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I put on a brave face, but was really ashamed and shut the gate. If
my wife could not leave me, neither could I leave her. We have had
numerous bickerings, but the end has always been peace between us.
The wife, with her matchless powers of endurance, has always been the
victor.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Today I am in a position to narrate the incident with some deta-
chment, as it belongs to a period out of which I have fortunately
emerged. I am no longer a blind, infatuated husband, I am no more my
wife’s teacher. Kasturba can, if she will, be as unpleasant to me
today, as I used to be to her before.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>We
are tried friends, the one no longer regarding the other as the
object of lust. She  has  been  a faithful nurse throughout my
illnesses, serving without any thought of reward.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The incident in question occurred in 1898, when I had no conception
of brahmacharya.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>It
was a time when I thought that the wife was the object of her
husband’s lust, born to do her husband’s behest, rather than a
helpmate, a comrade and a partner in the husband’s joys and
sorrows.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
It was in the year 1900 that these ideas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>underwent a radical transformation, and in 1906 they
took concrete shape. But of this I propose to speak in its proper
place. Suffice it to say that with the gradual disappearnace in me of
the carnal appetite, my domestic life became and is becoming more and
more peaceful, sweet and happy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Let no one conclude from this narrative of a sacred recollection that
we are by any means an ideal couple,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T13</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>or
that there is a complete identity of ideals between us. Kasturba
herself does not perhaps know whether she has any ideals
independently of me. It is likely that many of my doings have not her
approval even today. We never discuss them, I see no good in
discussing them. For she was educated neither by her parents nor by
me at the time when I ought to have done it. But she is blessed with
one great quality to a very considerable degree, a quality which most
Hindu wives possess in some measure. And it is this : Willingly or
unwillingly, consciously or unconsciouly, she has considered herself
blessed in following in my footsteps, and has never stood in the way
of my endeavour to lead a life of restraint. Though, therefore, there
is a wide difference between us intellectually, I have always had the
feeling that ours is a life of contentment, happiness and
progress.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T14</font></sup></p>

<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
necessary for me to explain to the reader how this story is written
from week to week.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
When I began writing it, I had no definite plan before me. I have no
diary or documents on which to base the story of my experiments.  I
write just as the Spirit moves me at the time of writing. I do not
claim to know definitely that all conscious thought and action on my
part is directed by the Spirit. But on an examination of the greatest
steps that  I have taken in my life, as also of those that may be
regarded as the least, I think it will not be improper to say that
all of them were directed by the Spirit.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I have not seen Him, neither have I known Him. I have made the
world’s faith in God my own, and as my faith is ineffaceable, I
regard that faith as amounting to experience. However, as it may be
said that to describe faith as experience is to tamper with truth, it
may perhaps be more correct to say that I have no word for
characterizing my belief in God.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
It is perhaps now somewhat easy to understand why<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I believe that I am writing this story as the Spirit<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>prompts me. When I began the last chapter I gave it
the heading I have given to this, but as I was writing it, I realized
that before I narrated my experiences with Europeans, I must write
something by way of a preface.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>This I did and altered the heading.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Now again, as I start on this chapter, I find myself confronted with
a fresh problem. What things to mention and what to omit regarding
the English friends of whom I am about to write is a serious problem.
If things that are relevant are omitted, truth will be dimmed. And it
is difficult to decide straightaway what is relevant, when I am not
even sure about the relevancy of writing this story.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I understand more clearly today what I read long ago about the
inadequacy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
all autobiography as history. I know that I do not set down in this
story all that I remember. Who can say how much I must give and how
much omit in the interest of truth? And what would be the value in a
court of law of the inadequate ex parte evidence being tendered by me
of certain events in my life<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>?
If some busybody were to cross-examine me on the chapters already
written, he  could probably shed much more light on them, and if it
were a hostile critics’s cross-examination, he might even flatter
himself for having shown up ‘the hollowness of many of my
pretensions’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I, therefore, wonder for a moment whether it might not be proper to
stop writing these chapters. But so long as there is no prohibition
from the voice within, I must continue the writing. I must follow the
sage maxim that nothing once begun should be abandoned</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
unless it is proved to be morally wrong.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I am not writing the autobiography to please critics. Writing it is
itself one of the experiments with truth. One of its objects is
certianly to provide some comfort and food for reflection for my
co-workers. Indeed I started writing it in compliance with their
wishes. It might not have been written, if Jairamdas and Swami Anand
had not persisted in their suggestion. If, therefore, I am wrong in
writing the auto- biography, they must share the blame.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But to take up the subject indicated in the heading. Just as I had
Indians living with me as members of my family, so had I<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>English
friends living with me in Durban. Not that all who lived with me
liked it. But I persisted in having them. Nor was I wise in every
case. I had some bitter experiences, but these included both Indians
and Europeans. And I do not regret the experiences. In spite of them,
and in spite of the inconvenience and worry that I have often caused
to friends, I have not altered my conduct and friends have kindly
borne with me. Whenever my contacts with strangers have been painful
to friends, I have not hesitated to blame them. I hold that believers
who have to see the same God in others that they see in themselves,
must be able to live amongst all with sufficient detachment. And the
ability to live thus can be cultivated, not by fighting shy of
unsought opportunities for such contacts, but by hailing them in a
spirit of service and withal keeping oneself unaffected by them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Though, therefore, my house was full when the Boer War broke out, I
received two Englishmen who had come from Johannesh-burg. Both were
theosophists, one of them being Mr. Kitchin, of whom we shall have
occasion to know more later. These friends<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>often cost my wife bitter tears. Unfortunately she has
had many such trials on my account. This was the first time that I
had English friends to live with me as intimately as members of my
family. I had stayed in English houses during my days in England, but
there I conformed to their ways of living, and it was more or less
like living in a boarding house. Here it was quite the contrary. The
English friends became members of the family. They adopted the Indian
style in many matters. Though the appointments in the house were in
the Western fashion, the internal life was mostly Indian. I do
remember having had some difficulty in keeping them as members of the
family, but I can certainly say that they had no difficulty in making
themselves perfectly at home under my roof. In Johannesburg these
contacts developed further than in Durban.</p>

clerks, who were perhaps more like my sons than clerks. But even
these were not enough for my work. It was impossible to do without
typewriting, which, among us, if at all, only I knew. I taught it to
two of the clerks, but they never came up to the mark because of
their poor English. And then one of these I wanted to train as  an 
accountant. I could not get out anyone from Natal, for nobody could
enter the Transvaal without a permit, and for my own personal
convenience I was not prepared to ask a favour of the Permit Officer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was at my wit’s end. Arrears were fast mounting up, so much so
that it seemed impossible for me, however much I might try, to cope
with professional and public work. I was quite willing to engage a
European clerk, but I was not sure to get a white man or woman to
serve a coloured man like myself. However I decided to try. I
approached a typewriter’s agent whom I knew, and asked him to get
me a stenographer<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>.
There were girls available<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>,
and he promised to try to secure the sevices of one. He came across a
Scotch girl called Miss Dick, who had just come fresh from Scotland.
She had no objection to earning an honest livelihood, wherever
available, and she was in need. So the agent sent her on to me. She
immediately prepossessed me.</p>

than a mere stenotypist. I had scarcely any reason<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
find fault with her work. She was often entrusted<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>with the management of funds amounting to thousands of
pounds, and she was in charge of account books. She won my complete
confidence, but what was perhaps more, she confided to me her
innermost thoughts and feelings. She sought my advice in the final
choice of her husband, and I had the privilege to give her away in
marriage. As soon as Miss Dick became Mrs. Macdonald, she had to
leave me, but even after her marriage she did not fail to respond,
whenever under pressure I made a call upon her.</p>

was fortunate in getting another girl. She was Miss Schlesin,
introduced to me by Mr. Kallenbach, whom the reader will know in due
course. She is at present a teacher in one of the High Schools in the
Transvaal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>She was about seventeen when she came to me. Some of her
idiosyncrasies were at times too much for Mr. Kallenbach and me. She
had come less to work as a stenotypist than to gain experience.
Colour prejudice was foreign to her temperament. She seemed to mind
neither age nor experience.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>She

him to his face what she thought of him.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Her
impetuosity often landed me in difficulties, but her open and
guileless temperament removed them as soon as they were created. I
have often signed without revision letters typed by her, as I
considered her English to be better than mine, and had the fullest
confidence in her loyalty.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Her sacrifice was great. For a cosniderable period she did not draw
more than £6, and refused ever to receive more than £10 a month.
When I urged her to take more, she would give me a scolding and say,
“I am not here to draw a salary from you. I am here becasue I like
to work with you and I like your ideals.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
She had once an occasion to take £40 from me, but she insisted on
having it as a loan, and repaid the   full  amount  last  year.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Her
courage was equal to her sacrifice. She is one of the few women I
have been privileged to come across, with a character as clear as
crystal and courage that would shame a warrior. She is a grown-up
woman now. I do not know her mind quite as well as when she was with
me, but my contact with this young lady will ever be for me a sacred
recollection.  I would therefore be false to truth if I kept back
what I know about her.</p>

Before I proceed with the other intimate European contacts, I must
note two or three items of importance. One of the con- tracts,
however, should be mentioned at once. The appointment of Miss Dick
was not enough for my purpose. I needed more assistance. I have in
the earlier chapters referred to Mr. Ritch. I knew him well. He was
manager in a commercial firm. He approved my suggestion of leaving
the firm and getting articled under me, and he considerably lightened

responsibility of attending to the editorial columns. The journal has
been until this day a weekly. In the beginning, it used to be issued
in Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil and English. I saw, however, that the Tamil
and Hindi sections were a make-believe. They did not serve the
purpose for which they were intended, so I discontinued them as I
even felt that there would be a certain amount of deception involved
in their continuance.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup></p>

I had no notion that I should have to invest any money in this
journal, but I soon discovered that it could not go on without my
financial help. The Indians and the Europeans both knew that, though
I was not avowedly the editor of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>, I was
virtually responsible for its conduct. It would not have mattered if
the journal had never been started, but to stop it after it had once
been launched would have been both a loss and a disgrace. So I kept
on pouring out my money, until ultimately I was practically sinking
all my savings in it. I remember a time when I had to remit £75 each
month.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But after all these years I feel that the journal has served the
community well. It was never intended to be a commercial con- cern.
So long as it was under my control, the changes in the jour- nal were
indicative of changes in my life. <i>Indian Opinion </i>in those
days, like <i>Young India </i>and <i>Navajivan </i>today, was a
mirror of part of my life. Week after week I poured out my soul in
its columns, and expounded the principles and practice of satyagraha
as I under- stood it. During ten years, that is, unitl 1914,
excepting the intervals of my enforced rest in prison, there was
hardly an issue of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>without an article
from me. I cannot recall a word in those articles set down without
thought or deliberation or a word of conscious exaggeration, or
anything merely to please. Indeed the journal became for me a
training in self-restraint, and for friends a medium through which to
keep in touch with my thoughts. The critic found very little to which
he could object. In fact the tone of <i>Indian Opinion </i>compelled
the critic to put a curb on his own pen. Satyagraha would probably
have been impossible without <i>Indian Opinion</i>. The readers
looked forward to it for a trustworthy account of the satyagraha
campaign as also of the real condition of Indians in South Africa.
For me it became a means for the study of human nature in all its
casts and shades<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>,
as I always aimed at establishing an intimate and clean bond between
the editor and the readers, I was inundated with letters containing
the outpourings of my correspondents’ hearts. They were  friendly,
critical or bitter, according to the temper of the writer. It was a
fine education for me to study, digest and answer all this
correspondence. It was as though the community thought audibly
through this corr- espondence with me. It made me thoroughly
understand the resp-</p>

onsibility of a journalist, and the hold I secured in this way over
the community made the future campaign workable, dignified and
irresistible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In the very first month of <i>Indian Opinion</i>, I realized that the
sole aim of journalism should be service. The newspaper Press is a
great power, but just as an unchained torrent of water submerges
whole countrysides and devastates crops, even so an uncontrolled pen
serves but to destory. If the control is from without, it proves more
poisonous than want of control. It can be profitable only when
exercised from within. If this line of reasoning is correct, how many
of the journals in the world would stand the test? But who would stop
those that are useless? And who should be the judge? The useful and
the useless must, like good and evil generally, go on together, and
man must make his choice.</p>

Some of the classes which render us the greatest social ser- vice,
but which we Hindus have chosen to regard as ‘untouchables’, are
relegated to remote quarters of a town or a village, called in
Gujarati <i>dhedvado</i>, and the name has acquired a bad odour. Even
so in Christian Europe the Jews were once ‘untouchables’, and the
quarters that were assigned to them had the offensive name of
‘ghettoes’. In a similar way today we have become the
untouchables of South Africa. It remains to be seen how far the
sacrifice of Andrews and the magic wand of Shastri succeed in
rehabilitating us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

themselves as the chosen people of God to the exclusion of all
others, with the result that their desc- endants were visited with a
strange and even unjust retribu- tion. Almost in a similar way the
Hindus have considered them- selves <i>Aryas </i>or civilized, and a
section of their own kith and kin as <i>Anaryas </i>or untouchables,

The reader will have now realized to some extent the meaning of the
word ‘locations’ with which I have headed this chapter. In South
Africa we have acquired the odious name of ‘coolies’. The word
‘coolie’ in India means only a porter or hired workman, but in
South Africa it has contemptuous connotation. It means what a pariah
or an untouchable means to us, and the quarters assigned to the
‘coolie’ are</p>

known as ‘coolie locations’. Johannesburg had one such location,
but unlike other places with locations where the Indians had tenancy
rights, in the Johannesburg location the Indians had acquired their
plots on a lease of 99 years. People were densely packed in the
location, the area of which never increased with the increase in
population. Beyond arranging to clean the latrines in the location in
a haphazard way, the Municipality did nothing to provide any sanitary
facilities, much less good roads or lights. It was hardly likely that
it would safeguard its sanitation, when it was indifferent to the
welfare of the residents. These were too ignorant of the rules of
municipal sanitation and hygiene to do without the help or
supervision of the Municipality. If those who went there had all been
Robinson Crusoes, theirs would have been a different story. But we do
not know of a single emigrant colony of Robinson Crusoes in the
world.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Usually
people migrate abroad in search of wealth and trade, but the bulk of
the Indians who went to South Africa were ignorant, pauper
agriculturists, who needed all the care and protection that could be
given them. The traders and educated Indians who followed them were
very few.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The criminal negligence of the Municipality and the ignorance of the
Indian settlers thus conspired to render the location thorou- ghly
insanitary. The Municipality, far from doing anything to improve the
condition of the location, used the insanitation caused by their own
neglect as a pretext for destroying the location, and for that
purpose obtained from the local legislature authority to dispossess
the settlers. This was the condition of things when I settled in
Johannessburg.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The settlers, having proprietary rights in their land,  were
naturally entitled to compensation. A special tribunal was appointed
to try the land acquisition cases. If the tenant was not prepared to
accept the offer of the Municipality, he had a right to appeal to the
tribunal, and if the latter’s award exceeded the Municipality’s
offer, the Municipality had to bear the costs.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Most of the tenants engaged me as their legal adviser. I had no
desire to make money out of these cases, so I told the tenants that I
should be satisfied with whatever costs the tribunal awarded, in case
they won, and a fee of £10 on every lease, irrespective of the
result of the case. I also told them that I proposed to set apart
half of the money paid by them for the builing of a hospital or
similar institution for the poor. This naturally pleased them all.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Out of about 70 cases only one was lost. So the fees amounted to a
fairly big figure. But <i>Indian Opinion </i>was there with its

claim and devoured, so far as I can recollect, a sum of £1,600. I
had worked hard for these cases. The clients always surrounded me.
Most of them were originally indentured labourers from Bihar and its
neighbourhood and from South India. For the  redress  of  their
peculiar grievances they had formed an association of their own,
separate from that of the free Indian merchants and traders. Some of
them were open-hearted, liberal men and had high character. Their
leaders were Sjt. Jairamsing, the president, and Sjt. Badri, who was
as good as the president. Both of them are now no more. They were
exceedingly helpful to me. Sjt. Badri came in very close contact with
me and took a prominent part in satyagraha. Through these and other
friends I came in intimate contact with numerous Indian settlers from
North and South India. I became more their brother than a mere legal
adviser, and shared in all their private and public sorrows and
hardships.</p>

The Indians were not removed from the location as soon as the
Municipality secured its ownership. It was necessary to find the
resi- dents suitable new quarters before dislodging them, but as the
Municipality could not easily do this, the Indians were suffered to
stay in the same ‘dirty’ location,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>with this difference that their condition became worse
than before. Having ceased to be proprietors they became tenants of
the<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Municipality, with the result that their surr-
oundings became more insanitary than ever. When they were pro-
prietors, they had to maintain some sort of cleanliness, if only for
fear of the law. The Municipality had<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>no such fear! The number of ten- ants increased, and
with them the squalor and the disorder.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
While the Indians were fretting over this state of things, there was 
a sudden outbreak of the black plague, also called pneumonic plague,
more terrible and fatal than the bubonic.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Fortunately it was not the location but one of the gold mines in the
vicinity of Johannesburg that was responsible for the outbreak. The
workers in this mine were for the most part Negroes, for whose
cleanliness their white employers were solely responsible. There were
a few Indians also working in connection with the mine, twenty-three</p>

of whom suddenly caught the infection, and returned one evening to
their quarters in the location with an acute attack of the plague.
Sjt. Madanjit, who was then canvassing subscribers for <i>Indian
Opinion </i>and realizing subscriptions, happened to be in the
location at this moment. He was a remarkably fearless man. His heart
wept to see these victims of the scourge, and he sent a pencil-note
to me to the following effect : ‘There has been a sudden outbreak
of the black plague. You must come immediately and take prompt
measures, otherwise we must be prepared for dire consequences. Please
come immediately.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Sjt.
Madanjit bravely broke open the lock of a vacant house, and put all
the patients there. I cycled to the location, and wrote to the Town
Clerk to inform him of the circumstances in which we had taken
possession of the house.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Dr.
William Godfrey, who was practising in Johannesburg, ran to the
rescue as soon as he got the news, and became both nurse and doctor
to the patients. But twenty-three patients were more than three of us
could cope with.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">It
is my faith, based on experience, that if one’s heart is pure,
calamity brings in its train men and measures to fight it. I had at
that time four Indians in my office—Sjts. Kalyandas, Maneklal, Gun-
vantrai Desai and another<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>whose
name I cannot recollect. Kalyandas had been entrusted to me by his
father. In South Africa I have rarely come across anyone more
obliging and willing to render implicit obedience than Kalyandas.
Fortunately he was unmarried then, and I did not hestitate to impose
on him duties involving risks, however great. Maneklal I had secured
in Johannesburg. He too, so far as I can remember, was unmarried. So
I decided to sacrifice all four—call them clerks, co-workers or
sons. There was no need at all to consult Kalyandas. The others
expressed their readiness as soon as they were asked. ‘Where you
are, we will also be,’ was their short and sweet reply.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Ritch had a large family. He was ready to take the plunge, but I
prevented him. I had not the heart to expose him to the risk. So he
attended to the work outside the danger zone.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

It was a terrible night—that night of vigil and nursing. I had
nursed a number of patients before, but never any attacked by the
black plague. Dr. Godfrey’s pluck proved infectious. There was not
much nursing required. To give them their doses of medicine, to
attend to their wants, to keep them and their beds clean and tidy,
and to cheer them up was all that we had to do.</p>

The Town Clerk expressed his gratitude to me for having taken charge
of the vacant house and the patients. He frankly confessed that the
Town Council had no immediate means to cope with such an emergency,
but promised that they would render all the help in their power. Once
awakened to a sense of their duty, the Municipality made no delay in
taking prompt measures.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The next day they placed a vacant godown at my disposal, and
suggested that the patients be removed there, but the Municipality
did not undertake to clean the premises. The building was unkempt and
unclean. We cleaned it up ourselves, raised a few beds and other
necessaries through the offices of charitable Indians, and improvised
a temporary hospital. The Minicipality lent the services of a nurse,
who came with brandy and other hospital equipment. Dr. Godfrey still
remained in charge.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The nurse was a kindly lady and would fain have attended to the
patients, but we rarely allowed her to touch them, lest she should
catch the contagion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We had instructions to give the patients frequent doses  of  brandy.
The nurse even asked us to take it for precaution, just as she was
doing herself. But none of us would touch it. I had no faith in its
beneficial effect even for the patients. With the permission of Dr.
Godfrey, I put three patients, who were prepared to do without
brandy, under the earth treatment, applying wet earth bandages to
their heads and chests. Two of these were saved. The other twenty
died in the godown.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Meanwhile the Municipality was busy taking other measures. There was
a lazaretto for contagious diseases about seven miles from
Johannesburg. The two surviving<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>patients were removed to tents near the lazaretto, and
arrangements were made for sending any fresh cases there. We were
thus relieved of our work.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
In the course of a few days we learnt that the good nurse had</p>

had an attack and immediately succumbed. It is impossible to say how
the two patients were saved and how we remained immune, but the
experience enhanced my faith in earth treatment, as also my
scepticism of the efficacy of brandy, even as a medicine. I know that
neither this faith nor this scepticism is based upon any solid
grounds, but I still retain the impression which then received, and 
have  therefore thought it necessary to mention it here.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On the outbreak of the plague, I had addressed a strong letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

negligence after the location came into its possession and
responsible for the outbreak of the plague itself. This letter

freindship of the late Rev. Joseph Doke.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have said in an earlier chapter that I used to have my meals at a
vegetarian restaurant. Here I met Mr. Albert West. We used to meet in
this restaurant every evening and go out walking after dinner. Mr.
West was a partner in a small printing concern. He read my letter in
the Press about the outbreak of the plague and, not finding me in the
restaurant, felt uneasy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My co-workers and I had reduced our diet since the outbreak, as I had
long made it a rule to go on a light diet during epidemics. In these
days I had therefore given up my evening dinner. Lunch also I would
finish before the other guests arrived. I knew the proprietor of the
restaurant very well, and I had informed him that, as I was engaged
in nursing the plague patients, I wanted to avoid the contact of
friends<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>as
much as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Not finding me in the restaurant for a day or two, Mr. West knocked
at my door early one morning just as I was getting ready to go out
for a walk. As I opened the door Mr. West said : ‘I did not find
you in the restaurant and was really afraid lest something should
have happened to you. So I decided to come and see you in the morning
in order to make sure of finding you at home. Well, here I am at your
disposal. I am ready to help in nursing the patients. You know that I
have no one depending on me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I expressed my gratitude, and without taking even a second to think,
replied : ‘I will not have you as a nurse. If there are no more
cases we shall be free in a day or two. There is one thing however.’</p>

I was delighted. We had the talk. He agreed to go. Salary was no

£10 per month and a part of the profits, if any, was fixed up. The
very next day Mr. West left for Durban by the evening mail,
entrusting me with the recovery of his dues. From that day until the
time I left the shores of South Africa, he remained a partner of my
joys and sorrows.</p>

Though my co-workers and I were relieved of the charge of the
patients, there remained many things arising out of the black plague
still to be dealt with.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have referred to the negligence of Municipality regarding the
location. But it was wide awake so far as the health of its white
citizens was concerned. It had spent large amounts for the
preservation of their health and now it poured forth money like water
in order to stamp out the plague. In spite of the many sins of
omission and commission against the Indians that I had laid at the
door of the Municipality, I could not help commending its solicitude
for the white citizens, and I rendered it as much help as I could in
its laudable efforts. I have an impression that, if I had withheld my
co-operation, the task would have been more difficult for the
Municipality, and that it would not have hesitated to use armed force
and do its worst.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But all that was averted. The Municipal authorities were pleased at
the Indian’s behaviour, and much of the future work regarding
plague measures was simplified. I used all the influence I could
command with the Indians to make them submit to the requirements of
the Municipality. It was far from easy for the Indians to go all that
length, but I do not remember anyone having resisted my advice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The location was put under a strong guard, passage in and out being
made impossible without permission. My co-workers and I had free
permits of entry and exit. The decision was to make the whole
location population vacate, and live under canvas for three weeks in

open plain about thirteen miles from Johan-nesburg, and then to set
fire to the location. To settle down under canvas with provisions and
other necessaries was bound to take some time, and a guard became
necessary during the interval.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The people were in a terrible fright, but my constant presence was a
consolation to them. Many of the poor people used to hoard their
scanty savings underground. This had to be unearthed. They had no
bank, they knew none. I became their banker. Streams of money poured
into my office. I could not possibly charge my fees for my labours in
such a crisis. I coped with the work somehow. I knew my bank manager
very well. I told him that I should have to deposit these moneys with
him. The banks were by no means anxious to accept large amounts of
copper and silver. There was also the fear of bank clerks refusing to
touch money coming from a plague-affected area. But the manager
accommodated me in every way. It was decided to disinfect all the
money before sending it to the bank. So far as I can remember, nearly
sixty thousand pounds were thus deposited. I advised such of the
people as had enough money to place it as fixed deposit, and they
accepted the advice. The result was some of them became accustomed to
invest their money in banks.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The location residents were removed by special train to Klipspruit
Farm near Johannesburg, where they were supplied with provisions by
the Municipality at public expense. This city under canvas looked
like a military camp. The poeple who were unac- customed to this camp
life were distressed and astonished over the arrangements, but they
did not have to put up with any particular inconvenience. I used to
cycle out to them daily. Within twenty-four hours of their stay they
forgot all their misery and began to live merrily. Whenever I went
there I found them enjoying themselves with song   and   mirth<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>.
  Three   weeks’   stay   in   the   open   air   evidently
improved their health.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
So far as I recollect, the location was put to the flames on the very
next day after its evacuation. The Municipality showed not the
slightest inclination to save anything from the conflagration. About
this very time, and for the same reason, the Municipality burnt down
all its timber in the market, and sustained a loss of some ten
thousand pounds. The reason for this drastic step was the discovery
of some dead rats in the market.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The Municipality had to incur heavy expenditure, but it successfully
arrested the further progress of the plague, and the city once more
breathed freely.</p>

The black plague enhanced my influence with the poor Indians, and
increased my business and my responsibility. Some of the new contacts
with Europeans became so close that they added considerably to my
moral obligations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I made the acquaintance of Mr. Polak in the vegetarian restaurant,
just as I had made that of Mr. West. One evening a young man dining
at a table a little way off sent me his card expressing a desire to
see me. I invited him to come to my table, which he did.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I am sub-editor of <i>The Critic</i>’, he said. ‘When I read
your letter to the Press about the plague, I felt a strong desire to
see you. I am glad to have this opportunity.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Polak’s candour drew me to him. The same evening we got to know
each other. We seemed to hold closely similar views on the essential
things of life. He liked simple life. He had a  wonderful faculty of
translating into practice anything that appealed to his intellect.
Some of the changes that he had made in his life were as prompt as
they were radical.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
<i>Indian Opinion </i>was getting more and more expensive every  day.
The very first report from Mr. West was alarming. He wrote : ‘I do
not expect the concern to yield the profit that you had thought
probable. I am afraid there my be even a loss. The books are not in
order. There are heavy arrears to be recovered, but one cannot make
head or tail of them. Considerable overhauling will have to be done.
But all this need not alarm you. I shall try to put things right as
best I can. I remain on, whether there is profit or not.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. West might have left when he discovered that there was no profit,
and I could not have blamed him. In fact, he had a right to arraign
me for having described the concern as profitable without proper
proof. But he never so much as uttered one word of complaint. I have,
however, an impression that this discovery led<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

to expect a profit.</p>

I now realize that a public worker should not make state- ments of

exercise the greatest caution. To allow a man to believe a thing
which one has not fully verified is to compromise truth. I am pained
to have to confess that, in spite of this know- ledge, I have not
quite  conquered my credulous habit, for which my ambition to do more
work than I can manage is responsible. This ambition has often been a</p>

On receipt of Mr. West’s letter I left for Natal. I had taken Mr.
Polak into my fullest confidence. He came to see me off at the
station, and left with me a book to read during the journey, which he
said I was sure to like. It was Ruskin’s <i>Unto This Last.</i></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">The
book was impossible to lay aside, once I had begun it. It gripped me.
Johannesburg to Durban was a twenty-four hours’ journey. The train
reached there in the evening. I could not get any sleep that night. I
determined to change my life in accordance with the ideals of the
book.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This was the first book of Ruskin I had ever read. During days of my
education I had read practically nothing outside text-books, and
after I launched into active life I had very little time for reading.
I cannot therefore claim much book knowledge. However, I believe I
have not lost much because of this enforced restraint. On the
contrary, the limited reading may be said to have enabled me
thoroughly to digest what I did read. Of these books, the one that
brought about an instantaneous and practical transformation in my
life was <i>Unto </i><i>This </i><i>Last</i>. I translated it later 
into  Gujarati,  entitling  it  <i>Sarvodaya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>(the welfare of all).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I believe that I discovered some of my deepest convictions reflected
in this great book of Ruskin, and that is why it so captured me and
made me transform my life. A poet is one who can call forth the good
latent in the human breast. Poets do not influence all alike, for
everyone is not evolved in an equal measure.</p>

proposed that <i>Indian Opinion </i>should be removed to a farm, on
which everyone should labour, drawing the same living wage, and

proposal, and £3 was laid down as the monthly allowance per head,
irrespective of colour or nationality.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
But it was a question whether all the ten or more workers in the
press would agree to go and settle on an out-of-the-way farm, and be
satisfied with bare maintenance. We therefore proposed that those who
could not fit in with the scheme should continue to draw their
salaries and gradually try to reach the ideal of becoming members of
the Settlement.</p>

I talked to the workers in the terms of this proposal. It did not
appeal to Sjt. Madanjit, who considered my proposal to be foolish and
held that it would ruin a venture on which he had staked his all;
that the workers would bolt, <i>Indian Opinion </i>would come to a

do not think I took more than two day to fix up these matters with
the men. Thereafter I at once advertised for a piece of land situated
near a railway station in vicinity of Durban. An offer came in
respect of Phoenix. Mr. West and I went to inpect the estate. Within
a week we purchased twenty acres of land. It had a nice little spring
and a few orange and mango trees. Adjoining it was a piece of 80
acres which  had  many  more  fruit  trees  and  a  dilapidated 
cottage.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The late Mr. Rustomji always supported me in such enterprises. He
liked the project. He placed at my disposal second- hand corr- ugated
iorn sheets of a big godown and other building material, with which
we started work. Some Indian carpenters and masons, who had worked
with me in the Boer War, helped me in ere-cting a shed for the press.
This structure, which was 75 feet long and 50 feet broad, was ready
in less than a month. Mr. West and others, at great personal risk,</p>

I now endeavoured to draw to Phoenix those relations and frien- ds

engaged in business of various kinds. They had come in search of
wealth, and it was therefore difficult to persuade them; but some
agreed. Of these I can single out here only Maganlal Gandhi’s name.
The others went back to business. Maganlal Gandhi left his business

It was no easy thing to issue the first number of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion
</i>from Phoenix. Had I not taken two precautions, the first issue
would have had to be dropped or delayed. The idea of having an engine
to work the press had not appealed to me. I had thought that
hand-power would be more in keeping with an atmosphere where 
agricultural work was also to be done by hand. But as the idea had
not appeared feasible, we had installed an oil-engine. I had,
however, suggested to West to have something handy to fall back upon
in case the engine failed. He had therefore arranged a wheel which
could be worked by hand. The size of the paper, that of a daily, was
considered unsuitable for an out-of-the-way place like Phoenix<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup>.

in folding the sheets. We usually finished our work between  ten
o’clock and mid-night. But the first night was unforgettable. The
pages were locked, but the engine refused to work. We had got out an
engineer from Durban to put up the engine and set it going. He and
West tried their hardest, but in vain. Everyone was anxious. West, in
despair, at last came to me, with tears in his eyes, and said, ‘The
engine will not work, I am afraid we cannot issue the paper in time.’</p>

 I said, comforting him.</p>

‘Where have we the men to work?’he replied. ‘We are not enough

Building work had not yet been finished, so the carpenters were still
with us. They were sleeping on the press floor. I said pointing to
them, ‘But can’t we make use of these carpenters? And we may have
a whole night of work. I think this device is still open to us.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘I dare not wake up the carpenters. And our men are really too
tired,’ said West.</p>

‘Well, that’s for me to negotiate,’ said I.</p>

replied.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I woke up the carpenters and requested their co-operation. They
needed no pressure. They said, ‘If we cannot be called upon in an
emergency, what use are we? You rest yourselves and we will work the
wheel. For us it is easy work.’ Our own men were of course ready.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
West was greatly delighted and started singing a hymn as we get to
work. I partnered the carpenters, all the rest joined turn by turn,
and thus we went on until 7 a.m. There was still a good deal to do. I
therefore suggested to West that the engineer might now be asked to
get up and try again to start the engine, so that if we succeeded we
might finish in time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

he touched it. The whole press rang with peals of joy.‘How can this
be? How is it that all our labours last night were of no avail, and
this morning it has been set going as though there were nothing wrong
with it?’ I enquired.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is difficult to say,’ said West or the engineer, I forget
which. Machines also sometimes seem to behave as though they required
rest like us.’</p>

This initial insistence ensured the regularity of the paper, and
created an atmosphere of self-reliance in Phoenix. There came a time
when we deliberately gave up the use of the engine and worked with
hand-power only. Those were, to my mind, the days of the highest
moral uplift for Phoenix.</p>

It has always been my regret that, although I started the Settlement
at Phoenix, I could stay there only for brief periods. My original
idea had been gradually to retire from practice, go and live at the
Settlement, earn my livelihood by manual work there, and find the joy
of service in the fulfilment of Phoenix. But it was not to be. I have
found by experience that man makes his plans to be often upset by
God, but at the same time where the ultimate goal is the search of
truth, no matter how a man’s plans are frustrated, the issue is
never injurious and often better than anticipated. The unexpected
turn that Phoenix took and the unexpected happenings were certainly
not injurious, though it is difficult to say that they were better
than our original expectations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In order to enable every one of us to make a living by manual labour,
we parcelled out the land round the press in pieces of three acres
each. One of these fell to my lot. On all these plots we, much
against our wish, built houses with corrugated iron. Our desire had
been to have mud huts thatched with straw or small brick houses such
as would become ordinary peasants but it could not be. They would
have been more expensive and would have meant more time, and everyone
was eager to settle down as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
The editor was still Mansukhlal Naazar. He had not accepted the new
scheme and was directing the paper from Durban where there was a
branch office for <i>Indian Opinion</i>. Though we had paid
compositors, the idea was for every member of the Settlement to learn
type-setting, the easiest, if the most tedious, of the processes in a
printing-press. Those, therefore, who did not already know the work
learnt it. I remained a dunce to the   last.  Maganlal  Gandhi 
surpassed  us  all.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1 </font></sup>Though
he had never before worked in a press, he became an expert compositor
and not only achieved great speed but, to my agreeable surprise,
quickly mastered all the other branches of press work. I have always
thought that he was not conscious of his own capacity.</p>

On return to Johannesburg, I informed Polak of the important changes
I had made. His joy knew no bounds when he learnt that the loan of
his book had been so fruitful. ‘Is it not possible,’ he asked<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup>,
‘for me to take part in the new venture?’ ‘Certainly,’ said
I, ‘You may if you like join the Settlement.’ ‘I am quite
ready,’ he replied ‘if you will admit me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
His determination captured me. He gave a month’s notice to his
chief to be relieved from <i>The Critic</i>, and reached Phoenix in
due course. By his sociability he won the hearts of all and soon
became a member of the family. Simplicity was so much a part of his
nature that, far from feeling the life at Phoenix in any way strange
or hard, he took to it like a duck takes to water. But I could not
keep him there long. Mr. Ritch had decided to finish his legal
studies in England, and it was impossible for me to bear the burden
of the office single- handed, so I suggested to Polak that he should
join the office and qualify as an attorney. I had thought that
ultimately both of us would retire and settle at Phoenix, but that
never came to pass. Polak’s was such a trustful nature that, when
he reposed his confidence in a friend, he would try to agree with him
instead of arguing with him. He wrote to me from Phoenix that though
he loved the life there, was perfectly happy, and had hopes of
developing the Settlement, still he was ready to leave and join the
office to qualify as an attorney, if I thought that thereby we should
more quickly realize our ideals. I  heartily welcomed the letter.
Polak left Phoenix, came to Johannesburg and signed his articles with
me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
About the same time a Scotch theosophist, whom I had been coaching
for a local legal examination, also joined as an articled clerk, on
my inviting him to follow Polak’s example. His name was Mr.
MacIntyre. Thus, with the laudable object of quickly realizing the
ideals at Phoenix, I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into a
contrary current, and had God not willed otherwise, I should have
found myself entrapped in this net spread in the name of simple life.</p>

On the boat bringing them to South Africa, Ramdas, my third son,
broke his arm while playing with the ship’s captain. The captain
looked after him well and had him attended to by the ship’s doctor.
Ramdas landed with his hand in a sling. The doctor had advised that,
as soon as we reached home,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the wound should   be  dressed  by  a qualified
doctor. But this was the time when I was full of faith in my
experiments in earth treatment. I had even succeeded in persuading
some of my clients who had faith in my quackery to try the earth and
water treatment.</p>

Ramdas ? He was just eight years old. I asked him if he would mind my
dressing his wound. With a smile he said he did not mind at all. It
was not possible for him at that age to decide what was the best
thing for him, but he knew very well the distinction between quackery
and proper medical treatment. And he knew my habit of home treatment
and had faith enough to trust himself to me. In fear and trembling I
undid the bandage, washed the wound, applied a clean earth poultice
and tied the arm up again. This sort of dressing went on daily for
about a month until the wound was completely healed. There was no
hitch, and the wound took no more time to heal than the ship’s
doctor had said it would under the usual treatment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
This and other experiments enhanced my faith in  such household
remedies, and I now proceeded with them with more self- confidence. I
widened the sphere of their application, trying the earth and water
and fasting treatment in cases of wounds, fevers, dyspepsia, jaundice
and other complaints, with success on most occasions. But nowadays I
have not the confidence I had in South Africa and experience has even
shown that these experiments involve obvious risks.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The reference here, therefore, to these experiments is not meant to
demonstrate their success. I cannot claim complete success for any
experiment. Even medical men can make no such claim for their exp-
eriments. My object is only to show that he who would go in for novel
experiments must begin with himself. That leads to a  quicker
discovery of truth, and God always protects the honest experimenter.</p>

I invited Polak to come and stay with me, and we began to live like
blood-brothers. The lady who was soon to be Mrs. Polak and he had
been engaged for some years, but the marriage had been pos- tponed
for a propitious time. I have an impression that Polak wanted to put
some money by before he settled down to a married life. He knew
Ruskin much better than I, but his Western surroundings were a bar
against his translating Ruskin’s teacher immediately into practice.
But I pleaded with him : ‘When there is a heart union, as in your
case, it is hardly right to postpone marriage merely for financial
cons- iderations. If proverty is a bar, poor men can never marry. And
then you are now staying with me. There is no question of household
expenses. I think you should get married as soon as possible.’ As I
have said in a previous chapter, I had never to argue a thing twice
with Polak. He appreciated the force of my argument, and immediately
opened correspondence on the subject with<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Mrs.
Polak, who was then in England. She gladly accepted the proposal and
in a few months reached Johannesburg. Any expense over the wedding
was out of the question, not even a special dress was thought
necessary. They needed no religious rites to seal the bond. Mrs.
Polak was a Christian by birth and Polak a Jew. Their common
relligion was the religion of ethics.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
I may mention in passing an amusing incident in connection with this
wedding. The Registrar of European marriages in the Transvaal could
not register marriages between black or coloured people. In the
wedding in question, I acted as the best man. Not that we could not
have got a European friend for the purpose, but Polak would not brook
the suggestion. So we three went to the Registrar of marriages. How
could he be sure that the parties to a marriage in which I acted as
the best man would be whites ? He proposed to postpone registration
pending inquiries. The next day was a Sunday<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.
The  day  following  was  New  Year’s   Day,   a   public  
holiday.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>To
postpone to date of a solemnly arranged wedding on such a flimsy
pretext was more than one could put up with. I knew the Chief
Magistrate, who was head of the Registration Department. So I
appeared before him with the couple. He laughed and gave me a note to
the Registrar and the marriage was duly registered.</p>

Up to now the Europeans living with us had been more or less known to

Polak and my wife had some unpleasant experiences, they would have
been no more than what happen in the best-regulated homogeneous
families. And let it be remembered that mine would be considered an
essentially heterogeneous family, where people of all kinds and
temperaments were freely admitted. When we come to think of it, the
distinction between heterogeneous and homogeneous is discovered to be
merely imaginary. We are all one family.</p>

I had better celebrate West’s wedding also in this chapter. At this
stage of my life, my ideas about <i>brahmacharya </i>had not fully
matured, and so I was interesting myself in getting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>all my bachelor friends married. When, in due course,
West made a pilgrimage to Louth to see his parents I advised him to
return married if possible. Phoenix was the common home, and as we
were all supposed to have become farmers, we were not afraid of
marriage and its usual conse-quences. West returned with Mrs. West, a
beautiful young lady from Leicester. She came of a family of
shoemakers working in a Leicester factory. Mrs. West had herself some
experience of work in this factory. I have called her beautiful,
because it was her moral beauty that at once attracted me. True
beauty after all consists in purity of heart. With Mr. West had come

In the same way as I persuaded these European friends to marry,  I
encouraged the Indian friends to send for their families from home.
Phoenix thus developed into a little village, half a dozen families
having come and settled and begun to increase there.</p>

It has already been seen that, though household expenses were heavy,
the tendency towards simplicity began in Durban. But the Johannesburg
house came in for much severer overhauling in the light of Ruskin’s
teaching.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
I introduced as much simplicity as was possible in a barrister’s
house. It was impossible to do without a certain amount of furniture.
The change was more internal than external. The liking for doing
personally all the physical labour increased. I  therefore  began  to
bring my children also under that discipline.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
Instead of buying baker’s bread, we began to prepare unleavened
wholemeal bread at home according to Kuhne’s recipe. Common mill
flour was no good for this, and the use of handground flour, it was
thought, would ensure more simplicity, health and economy. So I
purchased a hand-mill for £7. The iron wheel was too heavy to be
tackled by one man, but easy for two. Polak and I and the children
usually worked it. My wife also occasionally lent a hand,</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
though the grinding hour was her usual time for commencing kitchen
work. Mrs. Polak now joined us on her arrival. The grinding proved a
very beneficial exercise for the children. Neither this nor any other
work was ever imposed on them, but it was a pastime to them to come
lend a hand, and they were at liberty to break off whenever tired.
But the children, including those whom I shall have occasion to
introduce later, as a rule never failed me. Not that I had no
laggards at all, but most did their work cheerfully enough. I can
recall few youngsters in those days fighting shy of work or pleading
fatigue.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We had engaged a servant to look after the house. He lived with us as
a member of the family, and the children used to help him in his
work. The municipal sweeper removed the night-soil, but we personally
atten-ded to the cleaning of the closet instead of asking or
expecting the servant to do it. This proved a good training for the
children. The result was that none of my sons developed any aversion
for scavenger’s work, and they naturally got a good grounding in
general sanitation. There was hardly any illness in the home at
Johannesburg, but whenever there was any, the nursing was willingly
done by the children. I will not say that I was in-different to their
literary education, but I certainly did not hesitate to sacri-fice
it. My sons have therefore some reason for a grievance against me<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>.
Indeed they have occasionally given expression to it, and I must
plead guilty to a certain extent. The desire to give them a literary
education was there. I even endeavoured to give it to them myself,
but every now and then there was some hitch or other. As I had made
no other arrange- ment for their private tuition, I used to get them
to walk with me daily to the office and back home—a distance of
about 5 miles in all. This gave them and me a fair amount of
exercise. I tried to instruct them by conversation during these
walks, if there was no one else claiming my attention.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>All
my children, excepting the eldest, Harilal, who had stayed away in
India, were brought up in Johannesburg  in  this manner. Had I been
able to devote at least an hour to their literary education with
strict regularity, I should have given them, in my opinion, an ideal
education. But it has been their, as also my, regret that I failed to
ensure them enough literary training. The eldest son has often given
vent to his distress privately before me and publicly in the Press;
the other sons have generously forgiven the failure as unavoidable. I
am not heart-broken over it and the regret, if any, is that I did not
prove an ideal father. But I hold that I sacrificed their literary
training to what I genuinely, though maybe wrongly, believed to be
service to the community. I am quite clear that I have not been
negligent in doing whatever was needful for building up their
character. I believe it is the bounden duty of every parent to
provide</p>

for this properly. Whenever, in spite of my endeavour, my sons have
been found wanting, it is my certain conviction that they have
reflected, not want of care on my part,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>but the defects of both their parents.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Children inherit the qualities of the parents, no less than their
physical features. Environment does play an important part, but the
original capital on which a child starts in life is inherited from
its ancestors. I have also seen children successfully surmounting the
effects of an evil inheritance. That is due to purity being an
inherent attribute of the soul.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Polak and I had often very heated discussions about the desi-
rability or otherwise of giving the children an English education. It
has always been my conviction that Indian parents who train their
children to think and talk in English from their infancy betray their
children and their country. They deprive them of the spiritual and
social heritage of the nation, and render them to that extent unfit
or the service of the country<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.
Having these convictions, I made a point of always talking to my
children in Gujarati. Polak never liked this. He thought I was
spoiling their future. He contended, with all the vigour and love at
his command, that, if children were to learn a universal language
like English from their infancy, they would easily gain considerable
advantage over others in the race of life. He failed to convince me.
I do not now remember whether I convinced him of the correctness of
my attitude, or whether he gave me up as too obstinate. This happened
about twenty years ago, and my convictions have only deepened with
experience. Though my sons have suffered for want of full literary
education, the knowledge of the mother- tongue that they naturally
acquired has been all to their and the country’s good, inasmuch as
they do not appear the foreigners they would otherwise have appeared.
They naturally became bilingual, speaking and writing English with
fair ease, because of daily contact with a large circle of English
friends, and because of thier stay in a country where English was the
chief language spoken.</p>

Even after I thought I had settled down in Johannesburg, there was to
be no settled life for me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Just
when I felt that I should be breathing in peace, an unexpected event
happened. The papers brought the news of the outbreak of the Zulu
‘rebellion’ in Natal. I bore no grudge against the Zulus, they
had harmed no Indian. I had doubts  about  the  ‘rebellion’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>itself.

of loyalty prevented me from even wishing ill to the Empire.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>The rightness or otherwise of the ‘rebellion’ <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4
</font></sup>was therefore not likely to affect my decision. Natal
had a volunteer Defence Force, and it was open to it to recruit more
men<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup>. I read
that this force had already been mobilized to quell the ‘rebellion’.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I considered myself a citizen of Natal, being  intimately connected
with it. So I wrote to the Governor,  expressing my readiness, if
necessary, to form an Indian Ambulance Corps. He replied immediately
accepting the offer.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had not expected such prompt acceptance. Fortunately I had made all
the necessary arrangements even before writing the letter. If my
offer was accepted, I had decided to break up the Johannesburg home.
Polak was to have a smaller house, and my wife was to go and settle
at Phoenix. I had her full consent to this decision. I do not
remember her having ever stood in my way in matters like this. As
soon, therefore, as I got the reply from the Governor, I gave the
landlord the usual month’s notice of vacating the house, sent some
of the things to Phoenix and left some with Polak.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
I went to Durban and appealed for men. A big contingent was not
necessary. We were a party of twenty-four, of whom, be- sides me,
four were Gujaratis. The rest were ex-indentured men from South
India, excepting one who was a free Pathan.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
In order to give me a status and to facilitate work, as also in
accordance with the existing convention, the Chief Medical Officer
appointed me to the temporary rank of Sergeant Major and three men
selected by me to the rank of sergeants and one to that of corporal.
We also received our uniforms from the Government. Our Corps was on
active service for nearly six weeks. On reaching the scene of the
‘rebellion’, I saw that there was nothing there to justify the
name of ‘rebellion’. There was no resistance that one could see.
The reason why the disturbance had been magnified into a rebellion
was that a Zulu chief had advised non-payment of a new tax imposed on
his people, and had assagaied<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>a
sergeant who had gone to collect the tax. At any rate my heart was
with the Zulus, and I was delighted, on reaching headquarters, to
hear that our main work was to be  the nursing of the wounded Zulus.
The Medical Officer in charge welcomed us. He said the white people
were not willing nurses for the wounded Zulus, that their wounds were
festering, and he was at his wit’s end. He hailed our arrival as a
godsend for those innocent</p>

took us to the improvised hospital. The Zulus were delighted to see
us. The white soldiers used to peep through the railings that
separated us from them and tried to dissuade us from attending to the
wounds. And as we would not heed them, they became enraged and poured
unspeakable abuse on the Zulus.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Gradually I came into closer touch with these soldiers, and they
ceased to interfere. Among the commanding officers were Col. Sparks
and Col. Wylie, who had bitterly opposed me in 1896. They were
surprised at my attitude and specially called and thanked me. They
introduced me to General Mackenzie. Let not the reader think that
these were professional soldiers. Col. Wylie was a well-known Durban
lawyer. Col. Sparks was well known as the owner of a butcher’s shop
in Durban. General Mackenzie was a noted Natal farmer. All these
gentlemen were volunteers, and as such had received military training
and experience.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The wounded in our charge were not wounded in battle. A section of
them had been taken prisoners as suspects. The General had sentenced
them to be flogged. The flogging had caused severe sores. These,
being unattended to, were festering. The others were Zulu friendlies.
Although these had badges given them to distinguish them from the
‘enemy’, they had been shot at by the soldiers by mistake.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Besides this work, I had to compound and dispense prescriptions for
the white soldiers. This was easy enough for me as I had received a
year’s training in Dr. Booth’s little hospital. This work brought
me in close contact with many Europeans.</p>

forty miles a day. But wherever we went, I am thankful that we had
God’s good work to do, having to carry to the camp on our
stretchers those Zulu friendlies who had been inadvertently wounded,
and to attend upon them as nurses.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

in that of many Englishmen with whom I had occasion to talk. To hear
every morning reports of the soldiers’ rifles exploding like
crackers in innocent hamlets, and to live in the midst of them was a
trial. But I swallowed the bitter draught, especially as the work of
my Corps consisted only in nursing the wounded Zulus. I could see
that but for us the Zulus would have been uncared for. This  work, 
therefore, eased my conscience.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But there was much else to set one thinking.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

and far between in hills and dales were the scattered Kraals of the
simple and so-called ‘uncivilized’ Zulus. Marching, with or
without the wounded, through<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>these solemn solitudes, I often fell into deep
thought.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I pondered over <i>brahmacharya </i>and its implications, and my
convictions took deep root. I discussed it with my co-workers. I had
not realized then how indispensable it was for self-realization, but
clearly saw that one aspiring to serve humanity with his whole soul
could not do without it. It was borne in upon me that I should have
more and more occasions for service of the kind I was rendering, and
that I should find myself unequal to my task if I were engaged in the
pleasures of family life and in the propagation and rearing  of
children.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In a word, I could not live both after the flesh and the spirit.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3
</font></sup>On the present occasion, for instance, I should not have
been able to throw myself into the fray<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup>,
had my wife been expecting a baby.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5
</font></sup>Without the observance of <i>brahmacharya </i>service of
the family would be inconsistent with service of the community. With
<i>brahmacharya </i>they would be perfectly consistent.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So thinking, I became somewhat impatient to take a final vow. The
prospect of the vow brought a certain kind of exultation. Imagi-
nation also found free play and opened out limitless vistas of
service.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst I was thus in the midst of strenuous physical and mental work,
a report came to the effect that the work of suppressing the
‘rebellion’ was nearly over, and that we should soon be
discharged. A day or two after this our discharge came and in a few
days we got back to our homes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After a short while I got a letter from the Governor specially
thanking the Ambulance Corps for its services.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On my arrival at Phoenix I eagerly broached the subject of
<i>brahmacharya </i>with Chhaganlal, Maganlal, West and others. They 
liked the idea and accepted the necessity of taking the vow, but they
also represented the difficulties of the task. Some of them set
themselves bravely to observe it, and some, I know, succeeded also.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
I too took the plunge—the vow to observe <i>brahamcharya </i>for
life. I must confess that I had not then fully realized the magnitude
and immensity of the task I undertook. The difficulties are even
today staring me in the face. The importance of the vow is being more
and more borne in upon me. Life without <i>brahmacharya </i>appears
to me to be insipid and animal-like. The brute by nature knows no 
self- restraint. Man is man because he is capable of, and only in so
far as he exercises, self-restraint. What formerly appeared to me to
be extravagant praise of <i>brahmacharya </i>in our religious books
seems now, with increasing clearness every day, to be absolutely
proper and founded on experience.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
I saw that <i>brahmacharya</i>, which is so full of wonderful
potency, is by no means an easy affair, and certainly not a mere
matter of the body. It begins with bodily restraint, but does not end
there. The perfection of it precludes even an impure thought. A true
<i>brahmachari </i>will not even dream of satisfying the fleshly
appetite, and until he is in that condition, he has a great deal of
ground to cover.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
For me the observance of even bodily <i>brahmacharya </i>has been
full of difficulties. Today I may say that I feel myself fairly<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>safe,
but I have yet to achieve complete mastery over thought, which is so
essential. Not that the will or effort is lacking, but it is yet a
problem to me wherefrom undesirable thoughts spring their insidious
invasions. I have no doubt that there is a key to lock out
undesirable thoughts, but <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7
</font></sup>everyone has to find it out for himself. Saints and
seers have left their experiences for us, but they have given us no
infallible and universal prescription. For perfection or freedom from
error comes only from grace, and so seekers after God have left us
<i>mantras </i>, such as Ramanama, hallowed by their own austerities
and charged with their purity. Without an unreserved surrender to His
grace,  complete mastery over thought is impossible. This is the
teaching of evey great book of religion, and I am realizing the truth
of it every moment of my striving after that perfect <i>brahmacharya</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But part of the history of that striving and struggle will be told in
chapters to follow. I shall conclude this chapter with an indication
of how I set about the task. In the first flush of enthusiasm, I
found the observance quite easy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Events were so shaping themselves in Johannesburg as to make this
self-purification on my part a preliminary as it were to satyagraha. 
I can now see that all the principal events of my life, culminating
in the vow of <i>brahmacharya</i>, were secretly preparing me for it.

a weapon of the weak, that it could be characterized by hatred, and
that it could finally manifest itself as violence, I had to demur to
all these statements<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and explain the real nature of Indian move- ment. It was
clear that a new word must be coined by  the  Indians  to designate
their struggle.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But I could not for the life of me find out a new name, and therefore
offered a nominal prize through <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>to the
reader who made the best suggestion on the subject. As a result
Maganlal Gandhi coined the word ‘Sadagraha’ (<i>sat</i>—truth,
<i>agraha</i>— firmness)  and  won  the  prize.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>But
 in  order   to   make   it   clearer   I changed the word to
‘Satyagraha’ which has since become current in Gujarati as a
designation for the struggle.</p>

The history of this struggle is for all practical purposes a history
of the remainder of my life in South Africa and especially of my
experiments with truth in that sub-continent. I wrote the major
portion of this history in Yeravda jail and finished it after I was
released. It was published in  <i>Navajiva</i><i>n</i><i> </i>and
subsequently issued in book form<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup>.

MORE EXPERIMENTS IN DIETETICS</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
I was anxious to observe <i>brahmacharya </i>in thought, word and
deed, and equally anxious to devote the maximum of time to the
satyagraha struggle and fit myself for it by cultivating<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>purity.
I was therefore led to make further changes and to impose greater
restraints upon myself in the matter of food. The motive for the
previous  changes had been largely hygienic, but the new experiments
were made from a religious standpoint.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Fasting and restriction in diet now played a more important part in
my life. Passion in man is generally co-existent with a hankering
after the pleasures of the palate. And so it was with me. I have
encountered many difficulties in trying to control passion as well as
taste, and I cannot claim even now to have brought them under
complete subjection. I have considered myself to be a heavy eater.
What friends have thought to be my restraint has never appeared to me
in that light. If I had failed to develop restraint to the extent
that I have, I should have descended lower than the beasts and met 
my doom long ago. However, as I had adequately realized my
shortcomings, I made great efforts to get rid of them, and thanks to
this endeavour I have all these years pulled on with my body and put
in with it my share of work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Being conscious of my weakness and unexpectedly coming in contact
with congenial company, I began to take an exclusive fruit diet or to
fast on the <i>Ekadashi </i>day, and also to observe <i>Janmashtami
</i>and similar holidays.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I began with a fruit diet, but from the standpoint of restraint I did
not find much to choose between a fruit diet and a diet of food
grains. I observed that the same indulgence of taste was possible
with the former as with the latter, and even more, when one got
accustomed to it. I therefore came to attach greater importance to
fasting  or  having only one meal a day on holidays. And if there was
some occasion for penance or the like, I gladly utilized it  too  for
 the purpose of fasting.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I also saw that, the body now being drained  more effectively,
the food yielded greater relish and the appetite  grew keener. It
dawned upon me that fasting could be made as powerful a weapon of
indulgence as of restraint. Many similar later experiences of mine as
well as of others can be adduced as evidence of this</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
startling fact. I wanted to improve and train my body, but as my
chief object now was to achieve restraint and a conquest of the
palate, I selected first one food and then another, and at the same 
time  restricted the amount. But the relish was after me, as it were.
As I gave up one thing and took up another, this latter afforded me a
fresher and greater relish than its predecessor.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In making these experiments I had several companions, the chief of
whom was Hermann Kallenbach.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
have already written about this friend in the history of satyagraha
in South Arfica, and will not go over the same ground here. Mr.
Kallenbach was always with me whether in fasting or in dietetic
changes. I lived with him at his own place when the satyagraha
struggle was at its height. We discussed our changes in food and
derived more pleasure from the new diet than from the old. Talk of
this nature sounded quite pleasant in those days, and did not strike
me as at all improper. Experience has taught me, however, that it was
wrong to have dwelt upon the relish of food. One should eat not in
order to please the palate, but just to keep the body going. When
each organ of sense subserves the body and through the body the soul,
its special relish disappears, and then alone does it begin to
function in the way nature intended it to do.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Any number of experiments is too small and no sacrifice is too great
for attaining this symphony with nature. But unfortunately the
current is nowadays flowing strongly in the opposite direction. We
are not ashamed to<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>sacrifice a multitude of other lives in decorating the
perishable body and trying to prolong its existence for a few
fleeting moments<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>with the result that we kill ourselves, both body and
soul. In trying to cure one old disease, we give rise to a hundred
new ones; in trying to enjoy the pleasures of sense, we lose in the
end even our capacity for enjoyment. All this is passing before our
very eyes, but there are none so blind as those who will not see.</p>

up to them, I now propose to describe the dietetic experiments at

operation without chloroform. It was successful, but she had to

In a few days, however, I received a letter to the effect that
Kasturbai was worse, too weak to sit up in bed, and had once become
unconscious. The doctor knew that he might not, without my consent,
give her wines or meat. So he telephoned to me at Johannesburg for
permission to give her beef tea. I replied saying I could not grant
the permission, but that, if she was in a condition to express her
wish in the matter she might be consulted, and she was free to do as
she liked. ‘But,’ said the doctor, ‘I refuse to consult the
patient’s wishes in the matter. You must come yourself. If you do
not leave me free to prescribe whatever diet I like, I will not hold
myself responsible for your wife’s life.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I took the train for Durban the same day, and met the doctor who

beef tea when I telephoned to you.’</p>

‘No question of fraud in prescribing medicine or diet for a

I was deeply pained, but kept cool. The doctor was a good man and a

not be given beef tea. I next spoke to Kasturbai herself. She was
really too weak to be consulted in this matter. But I thought it my
painful duty to do so. I told her what had passed between the doctor
and myself. She gave a resolute reply : ‘I will not take beef tea.
It is a rare thing in this world to be born as a human being, and I
would far rather die in your arms<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I pleaded with her. I told her that she was not bound to follow me. I
cited to her the instances of Hindu friends and acquanitances who had
no scruples about taking meat or wine as medicine. But she was
adamant. ‘No,’ said she, ‘pray remove me at once.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I was delighted. Not without some agitation I decided to take her
away. I informed the doctor of her resolve. He exclaimed in a rage :
‘What a callous man you are! You should have been ashamed to broach
the matter to her in her present condition. I tell you your wife is
not in a fit state to be removed. She cannot stand the least little
hustling. I shouldn’t be surprised if she were to die on the way.
But if you must persist, you are free to do so. If you will not give
her beef tea, I will not take the risk of keeping her under my roof
even for a single day.’</p>

had to take the train from Durban for Phoenix, whence our Settlement
was reached by a road of two miles and a half. I was undoubtedly
taking a very great risk, but I trusted in God, and proceeded with my
task. I sent a messenger to Phoenix in advance, with a message to
West to receive us at the station with a hammock, a bottle of hot
milk and one of hot water, and six men to carry Kasturbai in the
hammock. I got a rickshaw to enable me to take her by the next
available train, put her into it in that dangerous condition, and
marched away.</p>

In two or three days of our arrival at Phoenix a Swami came to our
place. He had heard of the resolute way in which we had rejected the
doctor’s advice,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
he had, out of sympathy, come to plead with us. My second and third
sons Manilal and Ramdas were, so far as I can recollect, present when
the Swami came. He held forth on the religious harmlessness of taking
meat, citing authorities from Manu. I did not like his carrying on
this disputation in the presence of my wife, but I suffered him to do
so out of courtesy. I knew the verses from the <i>Manusmriti</i>, I
did not need them for my conviction. I knew also that there was a
school which regarded these verses as interpolations : but even if
they were not, I held my views on vegetarianism independently of
religious texts, and Kasturbai’s faith was unshakable. To her the
scriptural texts were a sealed book, but the traditional religion of
her forefathers was enough for her. The children swore by their
father’s creed and so they made light of the Swami’s discourse.
But Kasturbai put an end to the dialogue at once.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T12</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

My first experience of jail life was in 1908. I saw that some of the
regulations that the prisoners had to observe were such as should be
voluntarily observed by a <i>brahmachari</i>, that is, one desiring
to practise self-restraint.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Such, for instance, was the regulation requiring the
last meal to be finished before sunset<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup>.
Neither the Indian nor the African prisoners were allowed tea or
coffee. They could add salt to the cooked food if they wished, but
they might not have anything for the mere satisfaction of the palate.
When I asked the jail medical officer to give us curry powder, and to
let us add salt to the food whilst it was cooking, he said : ‘You
are not here for satisfying your palate. From the point of view of
health, curry powder  is  not necessary, and it makes no difference

Ultimately these restrictions were modified, though not with- out
much difficulty, but both were wholesome rules of self-restraint.
Inhibitions imposed from without rarely succeed, but when they are
self-imposed, they have a decidedly salutary effect. So, imme-
diately after release from jail, I imposed on myself the two rules.
As far as was</p>

then possible, I stopped taking tea, and finished my last meal before
sunset. Both these now require no effort in the observance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There came, however, an occasion which compelled me to give up salt
altogether, and this restriction I continued for an unbroken period
of ten years. I had read in some books on vegetarianism that salt was
not a necessary article of diet for man, that on the contrary
saltless diet was better for the health. I had deduced that a
<i>brahmachari </i>benefited by a saltless diet. I had<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>read and realized<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4
</font></sup>that the weak-bodied should avoid pulses<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup>.
I was very fond of them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Now it happened that Kasturbai, who had a brief respite after her
operation, had again begun getting haemorrhage, and the malady seemed
to be obstinate. Hydropathic treatment by itself did not  answer. She
had not much faith in my remedies, though she did not resist them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>She
certainly did not ask for outside help. So when all my <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8
</font></sup>remedies had failed, I entreated her to give up salt and
pulses. She would not agree, however much I pleaded with her,
supporting myself with authorities. At last she challenged me, saying
that even I could not give up these articles if I was advised to do
so. I was pained and equally delighted—delighted in that I got an
opportunity to shower my love on her. I said to her : ‘You are
mistaken. If I was ailing and the doctor advised me to give up these
or any other articles,  I should unhestitatingly do so. But there!
Without any medical advice, I give up salt and pulses for one year,
whether you do so or not.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
She was rudely shocked and exclaimed in deep sorrow:<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T9</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>‘Pray forgive me. Knowing you, I should not have
provoked you. I promise to abstain from these things, but for
heaven’s sake take back your vow. This is too hard on me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is very good for you to forgo these articles. I have not the
slightest doubt that you will be all the better without them. As for
me,  I cannot retract a vow seriously taken. And it is sure to
benefit me, for all restraint, whatever prompts it, is wholesome for
men. You will therefore leave me alone. It will be a test for me, and
a moral support to you in carrying out your resolve.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So she gave me up. ‘You are too obstinate. You will listen to
none,’ she said, and sought relief in tears.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I would like to count this incident as an instance of satyagraha and
it is one of the sweetest recollections of my life.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After that Kasturbai began to pick up quickly—whether as a result
of the saltless and pulseless diet or of the other consequent changes
in her food, whether as a result of my strict vigilance in exacting
observance of the other rules of life, or as an effect of the mental
exhilaration produced by the incident, and if so to what extent,</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
I cannot say. But she rallied quickly, haemorrhage completely
stopped, and I added somewhat to my reputation as a quack.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As for me, I was all the better for the new denials. I never craved
for the things I had left, the year sped away, and I found the senses
to be more subdued than ever. The experiment stimulated the
inclination for self-restraint, and I continued the abstention from
the articles until long after I returned to India. Only once I
happened to take both the articles whilst I was in London in 1914.
But of that occasion, and as to how I resumed both<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T10
</font></sup>, I shall speak in a later chapter.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have tried the experiment of a saltless and pulseless diet on many
of my co-workers, and with good results in South Africa. Medically
there may be two opinions as to the value of this diet, but morally I
have no doubt that all self-denial is good for the soul.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T11
  </font></sup>The diet of a man of self-restraint must be different
from that of a man of pleasure, just as their ways of life must be
different. Aspirants after <i>brahmacharya </i>often defeat their own
end by adopting courses suited to a life of pleasure.</p>

I have described in the last chapter how Kasturbai’s illness was
instrumental in bringing about some changes in my diet. At a later
stage more changes were introduced for the sake of supporting
<i>brahmacharya</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The first of these was the giving up of milk. It was from
Raychandbhai that I first learnt that milk stimulated animal passion.
Books on vegetarianism strengthened the idea, but so long as I had
not taken the <i>brahmacharya </i>vow I could not make up my mind to
forgo milk. I had long realized that milk was not necessary for
supporting the body, but it was not easy to give it up. While the
necessity for avoiding milk in the interest of self-restraint was
growing upon me, I happended to come across some literature from
Calcutta, describing the tortures to which cows and buffaloes were
subjected by their keepers. This had a wonderful effect on me. I
discussed it with Mr. Kallenbach.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Though I have introduced Mr. Kallenbach to the readers of the history
of satyagraha in South Africa, and referred to him in  a previous
chapter, I think it necessary to say something more about him here.
We met quite by accident. He was a friend of Mr. Khan’s, and as the
latter had discovered deep down in him a vein of otherworldliness he
introduced him to me.</p>

When I came to know him I was startled at his love of luxury and
extravagance. But in our very first meeting, he asked searching
questions concerning matters of religion. We incidentally talked of
Gautama Buddha’s renunciation. Our acquaintance soon ripened into
very close friendship, so much so that we thought alike, and he was
convinced that he must carry out in his life the changes I was making
in mine.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
At that time he was single, and was expending Rs. 1,200  monthly on
himself, over and above house rent. Now he reduced himself to such
simplicity that his expenses came to Rs. 120 per month. After the
breaking up of my household and my first release from jail, we began
to live together. It was a fairly hard life that we led.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
It was during this time that we had the discussion about milk. Mr.
Kallenbach said, ‘We constantly talk about the harmful effects of
milk. Why then do not we give it up? It is certainly not necessary.’
I was agreeably surprised at the suggestion, which I warmly welcomed,
and both of us pledged ourselves to abjure milk there and then. This
was at Tolstoy Farm<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>in
the year 1912.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
But this denial was not enought to satisfy me. Soon after this I
decided to live on a pure fruit diet, and that too composed of the
cheapest fruit possible. Our ambition was to live the life of the
poorest people.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
The fruit diet turned out to be very convenient also. Cooking was
practically done away with. Raw groundnuts, bananas, dates, lemons,
and olive oil composed our usual diet.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must here utter a warning for the aspirants of <i>brahmacharya</i>.
Though I have made out an intimate connection between diet and
<i>brahmacharya</i>, it is certain that mind is the principal thing.
A mind consciouly unclean cannot be cleansed by fasting. Modification
in diet have no effect on it. The concupiscence of the mind cannot be
rooted out except by intense self-examination, surrender to<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>God and, lastly, grace. But there is an intimate
connection between the mind and the body, and the carnal mind always
lusts for delicacies and luxuries.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>To obviate this tendency  dietetic  restrictions  and
 fasting would appear to be necessary. The carnal mind, instead of
controlling the senses, becomes their slave, and therefore the body
always needs clean non-stimulating foods and periodical fasting.</p>

Those who make light of dietetic restrictions and fasting are as much

FASTING</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
Just about the time when I gave up milk and cereals, and started on
the experiment of a fruit diet, I commenced fasting as a means of
self-restraint. In this Mr. Kallenbach also<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>joined me. I had been used to fasting now and again,
but for purely health reasons. That fasting was necessary for
self-restraint I learnt from a friend.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Having been born in a Vaishnava family and of a mother who was given
to keeping all sorts of hard vows, I had observed, while in India,
the <i>Ekadashi </i>and other fasts, but in doing so I had merely
copied my mother and sought to please my parents.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At that time I did not understand, nor did I believe in, the
efficacy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>of fasting. But seeing that the friend I have
mentioned was observing it with benefit, and with the hope of
supporting the <i>brahmacharya </i>vow, I followed his example and
began keeping the <i>Ekadashi </i>fast. As a rule Hindus allow
themselves milk and fruit on a fasting day, but such fast I had been
keeping daily. So now I began complete fasting, allowing myself only
water.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
When I started on this experiment, the Hindu month of <i>shravan </i>and
the Islamic month of <i>Ramzan </i>happened to coincide. The Gandhis
used to observe not only the Vaishnava but also the Shaivite vows,
and visited the Shaivite as also the Vaishnava temples. Some of the
members of the family used to observe pradosha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>in the whole of the month of <i>Shravan</i>. I decided
to do likewise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These important experiments were undertaken while we were at Tolstoy
Farm, where Mr. Kallenbach and I were staying with a few satyagrahi
families, including young people and children. For these last we had
a school. Among them were four or five Mussalmans. I always helped
and encouraged them in keeping all their religious observances. I
took care to see that they offered their daily <i>namaz</i>. There
were Christian and Parsi youngsters<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>too, whom I considered it my duty to encourage to
follow their respective religious observances.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
During this month, therefore, I persuaded the Mussalman youngsters to
observe the <i>Ramzan </i>fast. I had of course decided to observe
<i>pradosha </i>myself, but I now asked the Hindu, Parsi and</p>

 I  explained  to  them  that  it  was always a good thing to join
with others in any matter of self-denial. Many of the Farm inmates
welcomed my proposal. The Hindu and the Parsi youngsters did not copy
the Mussalman ones in every detail; it was not necessary. The
Mussalman youngsters had to wait for their breakfast until sunset,
whereas the others did not do so, and were thus able to prepare
delicacies for the Mussalman friends and serve them. Nor had the
Hindu and other youngsters to keep the Mussalmans company when they
had their last meal before sunrise next morning, and of course all
except the Mussalmans allowed themselves water<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">5</font></sup>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The result of these experiments was that all were convinced of the
value of fasting, and a splendid <i>esprit corps </i>grew up among
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We were all vegetarians on Tolstoy Farm, thanks, I must gratefully
confess, to the readiness of all to respect my feelings. The
Mussalman youngsters must have missed their meat during <i>Ramzan</i>,
but none of them ever let me know that they did so. They delighted in
and relished the vegetarian diet, and the Hindu youngsters often
prepared vegetarian delicacies for them, in keeping with the
simplicity of the Farm.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have purposely digressed in the midst of this chapter on fasting,
as I could not have given these pleasant reminiscences anywhere else,
and I have indirectly described a characteristic of mine, namely that
I have always loved to have my co-workers with me in anything that
has appealed to me as being good. They were quite new to fasting, but
thanks to the <i>pradosha </i>and <i>Ramzan </i>fasts, it was easy
for me to interest them in fasting as a means of self-restraint<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">6</font></sup>.</p>
<p class="footnote" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus an atmosphere of self-restriant naturally sprang up on the Farm.
All the Farm inmates now began to join us in keeping partial and
complete fasts<sup class="footnote">T</sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7</font></sup>,
which, I am sure, was entirely  to  the  good.  I cannot definitely
say how far this self-denial touched their hearts and helped them in
their striving to conquer the flesh. For my part, however, I am
convinced that I greatly benefited by it both physically and morally.
But I know that it does not necessarily follow that fasting and
similar disciplines would have the same effect for all.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Fasting can help to curb animal passion, only if it is undertaken
with a view to self-restraint. Some of my friends have actually found
their animal passion and palate stimulated as an after-effect of
fasts. That is to say, fasting is futile unless it is accompanied by
an incessant longing for self-restraint. The famous verse from the
second chapter of the <i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita</i><i> </i>is worth
noting in this connection :</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 145%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">For

Fasting and similar discipline is, therefore, one of the means to the
end of self-restraint but it is not all, and if physical fasting is
not accompanied by mental fasting, it is bound to end in hypocrisy
and disaster.</p>

</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>it
  was  found   necessary   to   make   some provision for the
education of its boys and girls. There were, among these, Hindu,
Mussalman, Parsi and Christian boys and some Hindu girls. I was not
possible, and I did not think it necessary, to engage special
teachers for them. It was not possible, for qualified Indian teachers
were scarce, and even when available, none would be ready to go to a
place 21 miles distant from Johannesburg on a small salary. Also we
were certainly not overflowing with money. And I did not think it
necessary to import teachers from outside the Farm. I did not believe
in the existing system of education, and I had a mind to find out by
experience and experiment the true system. Only this much I
knew—that, under ideal conditions, true education could be imparted
only by the parents, and that then there should be the minimum of
outside help, that Tolstoy Farm was a family, in which I occupied the
place of the father, and that I should so far as possible shoulder
the responsibility for the training of the young.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The conception no doubt was not without its flaws. All  the young
people had not been with me since their childhood, they had been
brought up in different conditions and environments, and they did not
not belong to the same religion. How could I do full justice to the
young people, thus circumstanced, even if I assumed the place of
paterfamilias ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I had always given the first place to the culture of the heart or
the building of character, and as I felt confident that moral
training could be given to all alike, no matter how different their
ages and their upbringing, I decided to live amongst them all the
twnety-four hours of the day as their father. I regarded character
buildings as the proper fundation for their education and, if the
foundation was firmly laid, I was sure that<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the children could learn all the other things
themselves or with the assistance of friends.</p>

But as I fully appreciated the necessity of a<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>literary training in addition, I started some classes
with the help of Mr. Kallenbach and Sjt. Pragji Desai. Nor did I
under-rate the building up of the body. This they got in the course
of their daily routine. For there were no servants on the Farm, and
all the work, from cooking down to scavenging, was done by the
inmates. There were many fruit trees to be looked after, and enough
gardening to be done as well. Mr. Kallencbach was fond of gardening
and had gained some experince of this work in one of the governmental
model gardens.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
It was obligatory on all, young and old, who were not engaged in the
kitchen, to give some time to gardening. The children had the lion’s
share of this work, which included digging pits, felling timber and
lifting loads. This gave them ample exercise. They took delight in
the work, and so they did not generally need any other exercise or
games. Of course some of them, and sometimes all of them, malingered
and shirked. Sometimes I connived at their pranks, but often I was
strict with them. I dare say they did not like the strictness, but I
do not recollect their having resisted it. Whenever I was strict, I
would, by argument, convince them that it was not right to play with
one’s work.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>The
conviction would, however, be short-lived, the next moment they would
again leave their work and go to play. All the same we got along, and
at any rate they built up fine physiques. There was scarcely any
illness on the Farm, though it must be said that good air and water
and regular hours of food were not a little responsible for this.</p>

A word about vocational training. It was my intention to teach every
one of the youngsters some useful manual vocation. For this purpose
Mr. Kallenbach went to a Trappist monastery and returned having
learnt shoe-making. I learnt it from him and taught the art to such
as were ready to take it up. Mr. Kallenbach had some experience of
carpentry, and there was another inmate who knew it; so we had a
small class in carpentry. Cooking almost all the youngsters knew.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
All this was new to them. They had never even dreamt that they would
have to learn these things some day. For generally the only training
that Indian children received in South Africa was in the three R’s.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
On Tolstoy Farm we made it a rule that the youngsters should not be
asked to do what<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T5</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>the teachers did not do, and therefore, when they were
asked to do any work, there was always a teacher co- operating and
actually working with them. Hence whatever the youngsters learnt,
they learnt cheerfully.</p>

It was seen in the last chapter how we provided for the physical
training on Tolstoy Farm, and incidentally for the vocational. Though
this was hardly done in a way to satisfy me, it may be claimed to
have been more or less successful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Literary training, however, was a more difficult matter. I had
neither the resources nor the literary equipment necessary; and I had
not the time I would have wished to devote to  the  subject.  The 
physical work that I was doing used to leave me thoroughly exhausted
at the end of the day, and I used to have the classes just when I was
most in need of some rest. Instead, therefore, of my being fresh for
the class, I could with the greatest difficulty keep myself awake.
The mornings had to be devoted to work on the farm and domestic
duties, so the school hours had to be kept after the midday meal.
There was no other time suitable for the school.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
We gave three periods<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1 </font>at
the most to literary training. Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati and Urdu were
all taught, and tuition was  given through the vernaculars of the
boys<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2</font>. English was taught
as well. It was also necessary to acquaint the Gujarati Hindu
children with a little Samskrit<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3</font>,
and to teach all the children  elementary  history, geography and
arithmetic.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had undertaken to teach Tamil and Urdu. The little Tamil I knew was
acquired during voyages and in jail. I had not got beyond Pope’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>excellent Tamil handbook. My knowledge of the Urdu
script was all that I had aqcuired on a single voyage, and my
knowledge of the language was confined to the familiar Persian and
Arabic words that I had learnt from contact with Mussalman friends.
Of Samskrit I new no more than I had learnt at the high school, even
my Gujarati was no better than that which one acquires at the school.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Such was the capital with which I had to carry on. In poverty of
literary equipment my colleagues went one better than I. But my love
for the languages of my country, my confidence in my capacity as a
teacher as also the ignorance of my pupils, and more than that, their
generosity, stood me in good stead.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The Tamil boys were all born in South Africa, and therefore knew very
little Tamil, and did not know the script at all. So I had to teach
them the script and the rudiments of grammar. That was easy</p>

enough. My pupils knew that they could any day beat me in Tamil
conversation, and when Tamilians, not knowing English, came to see
me, they became my interpreters. I got along merrily, because I never
attempted to disguise my ignorance from my pupils. In all respect I
showed myself to them exactly as I really was. Therefore in spite of
my colossal ignorance of the language I never lost their love and
respect. It was comparatively easier to teach the Mussalman  boys
Urdu. They knew the script. I had simply to stimulate in them an
interest in reading and to improve their handwriting.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These youngsters were for the most part unlettered and unsc- hooled.
But I found in the course of the work that I had very little to teach
them, beyond weaning them from their laziness,<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5
</font>and supe- rvising their studies. As I was content with this, I
could pull on with boys of different ages and learning different
subject in one and the same class-room.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Of text books, about which we hear so much, I never felt the want. I
do not even remember having made much use of the books that were
available. I did not find it at all necessary to load the boys with
quantities of books. I have always felt that the true textbook for
the pupil is his teacher. I remember very little that my teachers
taught me from books, but I have even now a clear recollection of the
things they taught me independently of books.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Children take in much more and with less labour through their ears
than through their eyes. I do not remember having read any book from
cover to cover with my boys. But I gave them, in my own language, all
that I had digested from my reading of various books, and I dare say
they are still carrying a recollection of it in their minds. It was
laborious for them to remember what they learnt from books, but I
imparted to them by word of mouth, they could repeat<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T6
</font>with the greatest ease. Reading was a task for them, but
listening to me was a pleasure, when I did not bore them by failure
to make my subject interesting.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T7
</font>And from the questions that my talks prompted them to put, I
had measure of their power of understanding.</p>

TRAINING OF THE SPIRIT</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
The spiritual training of the boys was a much more difficult matter
than their physical and mental training. I relied little on 
religious books for the training of the spirit. Of course I believed
that every student should be acquainted with the elements of his own
religion and have a general knowledge of his own scriptures, and
therefore I provided for such knowledge as best I could. But that, to
my mind, was part of the intellectual training. Long before I
undertook the education of the youngters of the Tolstoy Farm I had</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 5%">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
realized that the training of the spirit was a thing by itself. To
develop the spirit is to build character and to enable one to work
towards a knowledge of God and self-realization. And I held that this
was an essential part of the training of the young,<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1
</font>and that all training without culture of the spirit was of no
use, and might be even harmful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I am familiar with the superstition that self-realization is possible
only in the fourth stage of life, i.e., sanyasa (renunciation). But
it is a matter of common knowledge that those who defer preparation
for this invaluable experience until the last stage of life attain
not self- realization but old age amounting to a second and pitiable
childhood, living as a burden on this earth. I have a full
recollection that I held these views even whilst I was teaching,
i.e., in 1911-12, though I might not then have expressed them in
identical language.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
How then was this spiritual training to be given? I made the children
memorize and recite hymns, and read to them from books on moral
training. But that was far from satisfying me. As I came into closer
contact with them I saw that it was not through books that one could
impart training of the spirit. Just as physical training was to be
imparted through physical exercise, and intellectual  through
intellectual exercise, even so the training of the spirit was
possible only through the exercise of the spirit. And the exercise of
the  spirit  entriely depended on the life and character of the
teacher. The teacher had always to be mindful of his p’s and q’s,
whether he was in the midst of his boys or not.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It is possible for a teacher situated miles away to affect the spirit
of the pupils by his way of living. It would be idle for me, if I
were a liar, to teach boys to tell the truth. A cowardly teacher
would never succeed in making his boys valiant, and a stranger to
self-restraint could never teach his pupils the value of
self-restraint. I saw, therefore, that I must be an eternal
object-lesson to the boys and girls living with me. They thus became
my teachers, and I learnt I must be good and live straight, if only
for their sakes. I may say that the increasing discipline and
restraint I imposed on myself at Tolstoy Farm was mostly due to those
wards of mine.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
One of them was wild, unruly, given to lying, and quarrelsome. On one
occasion he broke out most violently. I was exasperated<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2</font>.
I never punished my boys, but this time I was very angry. I tried to
reason with him. But he was adamant and even tried to over-reach me.
At last I picked up a ruler lying at hand and delivered a blow on his
arm. I trembled as I struck him. I dare say he noticed it. This was
an entirely novel experience for them all. The boy cried out and
begged to be forgiven. He cried not because the beating was painful
to him;</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
he could, if he had been so minded, have paid me back in the same
coin, being a stoutly-built youth of seventeen; but he realized my
pain in being driven to this violent resource. Never again after this
incident did he disobey me. But I still repent that violence. I am
afriad I exhibited before him that day not the spirit, but the brute,
in me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I have always been opposed to corporal punishment.  I  remember only
one occasion on which I physically punished one of my sons. I have
therefore never until this day been able to decide whether I was
right or wrong in using the ruler. Probably it was improper, for it
was prompted by anger and a desire to punish. Had it been an
expression only of my distress, I should have considered it
justified. But the motive in this case was mixed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This incident set me thinking and taught me a better method of
correcting students. I do not know whether that method would have
availed on the occasion in question. The youngster soon forgot the
incident, and I do not think he ever showed great improvement. But
the incident made me understand better the duty of a teacher towards
his pupils.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Cases of<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3 </font>misconduct on
the part of the boys often occurred after this, but I never resorted
to corporal punishment. Thus in my endeavour to impart spiritual
training to the boys and girls under me,  I came to understand better
and better the power of the spirit.</p>

It was at Tolstoy Farm that Mr. Kallenbach drew my attention to  a
problem that had never before struck me. As I have already said, some
of the boys at the Farm were bad and unruly. There  were loafers, too
amongst them. With these my three boys came in daily contact, as also
did other children of the same type as my own sons. This troubled Mr.
Kallenbach, but his attention was centred on the impropriety of
keeping <i>my </i>boys with these unruly youngsters.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One day he spoke out: ‘Your way of mixing your own boys with the
bad ones does not appeal to me. It can have only one result. They
will become demoralized through this bad company.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I do not remember whether the question puzzled me at the moment, but
I recollect what I said to him :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘How can I distinguish between my boys and the loafers? I am
equally responsible for both. The youngsters have come because I
invited them. If I were to dismiss them with some money, they would
immediately run off to Johannesburg and fall back into their old
ways. To tell you the truth, it is quite likely that they and their
guardians believe that, by having come here, they have laid me under</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
an obligation. That they have to put up with a good deal of
inconvenience here, you and I know very well. But my duty is clear. I
must have them here, and therefore my boys also must live with them.
And surely, you do not want me to teach my boys to feel from today
that they are superior to other boys. To put that sense of
superiority into their heads would be to lead them stray. This
association with other boys will be a good discipline for them. They
will, of their own accord, learn to discriminate between good and
evil. Why should we not believe that, if there is really anything
good in them, it is bound to react on their companions? However that
may be, I cannot  help keeping them here, and if that means some
risk, we must run it.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
Mr. Kallenbach shook his head.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The result, I think, cannot be said to have been bad. I do not
consider my sons were any the worse for the experiment. On the
contrary I can see that they gained something. If there was  the 
slightest trace of superiority in them, it was destroyed and they
learnt to mix with all kinds of children. They were tested and
disciplined.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This and similar experiments have shown me that, if good children are
taught together with bad ones and thrown into their company, they
will lose nothing, provided the experiment is conducted under the
watchful case of their parents and guardians.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Children wrapped up in cottonwool are not always proof against all
temptation or contamination. It is true, however, that when boys and
girls of all kinds of upbringing are kept and taught together, the
parents and the teachers are put to the severest test. They have
constantly to be on the alert.</p>

Day by day it became increasingly clear to me  how  very  difficult
it was to bring up and educate boys and girls in the right way. If I
was to be their real teacher and guardian, I must touch their hearts.
I must share their joys and sorrows, I must help them to solve the
problems that faced them, and I must take along the right channel the
surging aspirations of their youth.</p>

On the release of some of the satyagrahis from jail, Tolstoy Farm was
almost denuded of its inmates. The few that  remained mostly belonged
to Phoenix. So I removed them there. Here I had to pass through a
fiery ordeal.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
In those days I had to move between  Johannesburg  and Phoenix. Once
when I was in Johannesburg I received tidings of the moral fall of
two of the inmates of the Ashram. News of an apparent failure or
reverse in the satyagraha struggle would not have shocked</p>

me, but this news came upon me like a thunderbolt.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1
</font>The same day I took the train for Phoenix. Mr. Kallenbach
insisted on accompanying me. He had noticed the state I was in. He
would not brook the thought of my going alone, for he happened to be
the bearer of the tidings which had so upset me.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
During the journey my duty seemed clear to me.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2
</font>I felt that the guardian or teacher was responsible, to some
extent at least, for the lapse of his ward or pupil. So my
responsibility regarding the incident in question became clear to me
as daylight. My wife had already warned me in the matter, but being
of a trusting nature,I had ignored her caution. I felt that the only
way the guiltyparties could be made to realize my distress and the
depth of their own fall would be for me to do some penance. So I
imposed upon myself a fast for seven days and a vow to have only one
meal a day for a period of four months and a half. Mr. Kallenbach
tried to dissuade me, but in vain. He fully<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>conceded the propriety of the penance, and insisted on joining
me. I could not resist his transparent affection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I felt greatly relieved, for the decision meant a heavy load off my
mind. The anger against the guilty parties subsided and gave place to
the purest pity for them. Thus considerably eased, I reached Phoenix.
I made further investigation and acquainted myself with  some more
details I needed to know.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
My penance pained everybody, but it cleared the atmos- phere.
Everyone came to realize what a terrible thing it was to be sinful,
and the bond that bound me to the boys and girls became stronger and
truer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
A circumstance arising out of this incident compelled me, a little
while after, to go into a fast for fourteen days, the results of
which<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4 </font>exceeded even my
expectations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
It is not my purpose to make out from these incidents that it is the
duty of a teacher to resort to fasting whenever there is a 
delinquency on the part of his pupils. I hold, however, that some
occa- sions do call for this drastic remedy. But it presupposes
clearness of vision and spiritual fitness. Where there is no true
love between the teacher and the pupil, where the pupil’s
delinquency has not touched the very being of the teacher and where
the pupil has no respect for the teacher, fasting is out of place and
may even be harmful. Though there is thus room for doubting the
propriety of fasts in such cases,</p>

first penance did not prove difficult for any of us. I had to suspend
or stop none of my normal activities. It may be recalled that during
the whole of this period of penance I was a strict fruita- rian. The
latter part of the second fast went fairly hard with me. I had not
then completely understood the wonderful efficacy of  Ramanama, and
my capacity for suffering was to that extent less. Besides, I did not
know the technique of fasting, especially the necessity of drinking
plenty of water, however nauseating or distasteful it might be. Then
the fact that the first had been an easy affair had made me rather
careless as to the second. Thus during the first I took Kuhne baths
every day, but during the second I gave them up after two or three
days, and drank very little water, as it was distasteful and produced
nausea. The throat became parched and weak and during the last days I
could speak only in a very low voice. In spite of this, however, my
work was carried on through dictation where writing was necessary. I
regularly listened to readings from the <i>Ramayana </i>and other
sacred books. I had also sufficient strength to discuss and advise in
all urgent matters.</p>

During satyagraha I had begun travelling third class. I therefore
took third class passages for this voyage. But there was a good deal
of difference between third-class accommodation on the boat on this
route and that provided on Indian coastal boats or railway trains.
There is hardly sufficient sitting, much less sleeping, accommodation
in the Indian service, and little cleanliness. During the voyage to
London, on the other hand, there was enough room and cleanliness, and
the steamship company had provided special facilities for us. The
company had provided reserved closet accommodation for us, and as we
were fruitarians, the steward had orders to supply us with fruits and
nuts. As a rule third-class passengers get little fruit or nuts.
These facilities made our eighteen days on the boat quite

Some of the incidents during the voyage are well worth recording. Mr.
Kallenbach was very fond of binoculars, and had one or two costly
pairs. We had daily discussions over one of these. I tried to impress
on him that this possession was not in keeping with the ideal of
simplicity that we aspired to reach. Our discussions came to a</p>

head<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1 </font>one day, as we were
standing near the porthole of our cabin. ‘Rather than allow these

why not throw them into the sea and be done with them ?’ said I.

infatuation for them. However, having got rid of them, he never
regretted it.</p>

This is but one out of the many<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2

Every day we had to learn something new in this way, for both of us
were trying to tread the path of truth. In the march towards truth,
anger, selfishness, hatred, etc., naturally give way, for otherwise
truth would be impossible to attain. A man who is swayed by passions
may have good enough intentions, may be truthful in word, but he will
never find the truth. A successful search for truth means complete
deliverance from the dual throng such as of love and hate, happiness
and misery.</p>

Not much time had elapsed since my fast when we started on our
voyage. I had not regained my normal strength. I used to stroll on
deck to get a little exercise, so as to revive my appetite and digest
what I ate. But even this exercise was beyond me, causing pain in the
calves, so much so that on reaching London I found that I was worse<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>rather than better. There I came to know Dr. Jivraj Mehta. I
gave him the history of my fast and subsequent pain, and he said, ‘If
you do not take complete rest for a few days, there is a fear of your
legs going out of use.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was then that I learned that a man emerging from a long fast
should not be in a hurry to regain lost strength, and should also put
a curb on his appetite. More caution and perhaps more restraint are
necessary in breaking a fast than in keeping it.</p>

In Madeira we heard that the great War might break out at any moment.
As we entered the English Channel, we received the news of its actual
outbreak. We were stopped for some time. It was difficult business to
tow the boat through the submarine mines which had been laid
throughout the Channel, and it took about two days to reach
Southampton.</p>

On arrival in England I learned that Gokhale had been stranded in
Paris where he had gone for reason of health,  and  as communication
between Paris and London had been cut off, there was no knowing when
he would return. I did not want to go home without having seen him,
but no one could say definitely when he would arrive.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
What then was I to do in the meanwhile ? What was my duty as regards
the War ? Sorabji Adajania, my comrade in jail and a satyagrahi, was
then reading for the bar in London. As one of the best satyagrahis<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1
</font>he had been sent to England to qualify himself as a barrister,
so that he might take my place on return to South Africa. Dr.
Pranjivandas Mehta was paying his expenses. With him, and through
him, I had conferences with Dr. Jivraj Mehta and others who were
prosecuting their studies in England. In consultation with them, a
meeting of the Indian residents in Great Britian and  Ireland  was 
called. I placed my views before them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I felt that Indians residing in England ought to do their bit in the
War. English students had volunteered to serve in the army, and
Indians might do no less. A number of objections were taken to this
line of argument. There was, it was contended, a world of difference
between the Indians and the English. We were slaves and they were
masters. How could a slave co-operate with the master in the hour of
the latter’s need ? Was it not the duty of the slave, seeking to be
free, to make the master’s need his opprtunity? This argument
failed to appeal to me then. I knew the difference of status between
an Indian and an Englishman, but I did not believe that we had been
quite reduced to slavery. I felt then that it was more the fault of
individual British officials than of the British system, and that we
could convert them by love. If we would improve our status through
the help and co-operation of the British, it was our duty to win
their help  by standing by them in their hour of need. Though the
system was faulty, it did not seem to me to be intolerable, as it
does today. But if, having lost my faith in the system, I refuse to
co-operate with<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>the
British Government today, how could those friends then do so, having
lost their faith not only in the system but in the officials as well
?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The opposing friends felt that that was the hour for making a bold

Indians.</p>

advice and invited those who would to enlist as volunteers.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

I wrote a letter to Lord Crewe, acquainting him with these facts, and
expressing our readiness to be trained for ambulance work, if that
should be considered a condition precedent to the acceptance of our

The volunteers began their preliminary training in first aid to the
wounded under the well-known Dr. Cantlie<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

whole course of first-aid.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We were a class of about 80. In six weeks we were examined, and all

drill and other training. Colonel Baker was placed in charge of this
work.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>

London in these days was a sight worth seeing. There was no panic,
but all were busy helping to the best of their ability. Able- bodied
adults began training as combatants, but what were the old, the
infirm and the women to do? There was enough work for them, if they
wanted. So they employed themselves in cutting and making clothes and
dressings for the wounded.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The Lyceum, a ladies’ club, undertook to make as many clothes for
the soldiers as they could. Shrimati Sarojini Naidu was a member of
this club, and threw herself whole-heartedly into the work. This was
my first acquaintance with her. She placed before me a  heap  of
clothes which had been cut to pattern, and asked me to get them all<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5

the assistance of friends got as many clothes made as I could manage

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
I had to a certain extent anticipated this objection, for I had
discussed the question in my  <i>Hind</i><i>u </i><i>Swara</i><i>j 
</i>or  <i>India</i><i>n </i><i>Hom</i><i>e </i><i>Rule</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>, and used to discuss it day in and day out with friends
in South Africa. All of us recognized the immorality of war. If I was
not prepar- ed to prosecute my assailant, much less should I be
willing to<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1  </font>participate
in a war, especially when I knew nothing of the justice or otherwise
of the cause of the combatants. Friends of course knew that I had
previously served in the Boer War, but they assumed that my views had
since undergone a change.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
As a matter of fact the very same line of argument that persuaded me
to take part in the Boer War had weighed with me on this occasion. It
was quite clear to me that participation in war could never be
consistent with ahimsa. But it is not always given to one to be
equally clear about one’s duty. A votary of truth is often obliged
to grope in the dark.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Ahimsa
is a comprehensive principle. We are helpless mortals caught in the
conflagration of <i>himsa</i>. The saying that life lives on life has
a deep meaning in it. Man cannot for a moment live without
consciously or unconsciously committing outward <i>himsa</i>. The
very fact of his living—eating, drinking and moving
about–necessarily involves some <i>himsa</i>, destruction of life,
be it ever so minute. A votary of ahimsa therefore remains true to
his faith if the spring of all his actions is compassion, if he shuns
to the best of his ability the destruction of the tiniest creature,
tries to save it, and thus incessantly strives to be free from the
deadly coil of <i>himsa. </i>He will be constantly growing in
self-restraint and compassion, but he can never become entirely free
from outward <i>himsa</i><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2</font>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Then
again, because underlying ahimsa is the unity of all life, the error
of one cannot but affect all, and hence man cannot be  wholly free
from <i>himsa</i>. So long as he continues to be a social being, he
cannot but participate in the <i>himsa </i>that the  very  existence 
of  society involves<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3</font>.
When two nations are fighting, the duty of a votary of ahimsa is to
stop the war. He who is not equal to that duty, he who has no power
of resisting war, he who is not qualified to resist war, may take
part in war, and yet whole-heartedly try to free himself, his nation
and the world from war.</p>

protection of the British Fleet, and taking shelter as I did under
its armed might, I was directly participating in its potential
violence. Therefore, if I desired to retain my connection with the
Empire and to live under its banner, one of three courses was open to
me : I could declare open resistance to the War and, in accordance
with the law of satyagraha, boycott the Empire until it changed its
military policy; or I could seek imprisonment by civil disobedience
of such of its laws as were fit to be disobeyed; or I could
participate in the War on the side of the Empire and thereby acquire
the capacity and fitness for  resisting the violence of war. I lacked
this capacity and fitness, so I thought there was nothing for it but
to serve in the War.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I make no distinction, from the point of view of ahimsa, between
combatants and non-combatants. He who volunteers to serve a band of
dacoits, by working as their carrier, or their watchman while they
are about their business, or their nurse when they are wounded, is as
much guilty of dacoity as the dacoits themselves. In the same way
those who confine themselves to attending to the wounded in battle
cannot be absolved from the guilt of war.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had argued the whole thing out to myself in this manner, before I
received Polak’s cable, and soon after its receipt, I discussed
these views with several friends and concluded that it was my duty to
offer to serve in the War. Even today I see no flaw in that line of
argument, nor am I sorry for my action, holding, as I then did, views
favourable to the British connection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I know that even then I could not carry conviction with all my
friends about the correctness of my position. The question is subtle.
It admits of differences of opinion, and therefore I have submitted
my argument as clearly as possible to those who believe in ahimsa and
who are making serious efforts to practise it in every walk of life.
A devotee of Truth may not do anything in deference to convention. He
must always hold himself open to correction, and whenever he
discovers himself to be wrong he must confess it at all costs and
atone for it.</p>

were all under the impression that this Commanding Officer was to be
our chief only so far as technical matters were concerned, and that
in all other matters I was the head of our Corps, which was directly
responsible to me in matters of internal discipline; that is to say,
the Commanding Officer had to deal with the Corps through me. But
from the first the Officer left us under no such delusion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Sorabji Adajania was a shrewd man. He warned me.  ‘Beware of
this man,’ he said, ‘He seems inclined to lord it over us. We
will have one of his orders. We are prepared to look upon him as our
instructor. But the youngsters he has appointed to instruct us also
feel as though they had come as our masters.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These youngsters were Oxford students who had come  to instruct us
and whom the Commanding Officer had appointed to be our section
leaders.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I also had not failed to notice the high-handedness of the Commanding
Officer, but I asked Sorabji not to be anxious and tried to pacify
him. But he was not the man to be easily convinced.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You are too trusting. These people will deceive you with
wretched<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>words, and when
at last you see through them, you will ask us to resort to
satyagraha, and so come to grief, and bring us all to grief along
with you<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3</font>,’ said he
with a smile.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘What else but grief can you hope to come to after having cast in
your lot with me?’ said I. ‘A satyagrahi is born to be deceived.
Let the Commanding Officer deceive us. Have I not told you times
without number that ultimately a deceiver only deceives himself ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sorabji gave a loud laugh. ‘Well, then,‘ said he, ‘continue to
be deceived. You wil some day meet your death in satyagraha and drag
poor mortals like me behind you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
These words put me in mind of what the late Miss Emily Hobhouse wrote
to me with regard to non-co-operation : ‘I should not be surprised
if one of these days you have to go to the gallows for the sake of
truth. May God show you the right path and protect you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The talk with Sorabji took place just after the appointment of the
Commanding Officer. In a very few days our relations with him reached
the breaking point. I had hardly regained my strength after the
fourteen days’ fast, when I began to take part in the drill, often
walking to the appointed place about two miles from home. This gave
me pleurisy and laid me low. In this condition I had to go week-end
camping. Whilst the others stayed there, I returned home. It was here
that an occasion arose for satyagraha.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Commanding Officer began to exercise his authority som- ewhat
freely. He gave us clearly to understand that he was our head in</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
all matters, military and non-military, giving us at the same time a
taste of his authority. Sorabji hurried to me. He was not at all
prepared to put up with this high-handedness. He said ; ‘We must
have all order through you. We are still in the training camp and all
sorts of absurd orders are being issued. Invidious distinctions are
made between ourselves and those youths who have been appointed to
instruct us. We must have it out with the Commanding Officer,
otherwise we shall not be able to go on any longer. The Indian
students and others who have joined our Corps are not going to abide
by any absurd orders. In a cause which has been taken up for the sake
of self-respect, it is unthinkable to put up with loss of it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I approached the Commanding Officer and drew his attention to the
complaints I had received. He wrote asking me to set out the
complaints in writing, at the same time asking me ‘to impress upon
those who complain that the proper direction in which to make
complaints is to me through  their section commanders,  now
appointed, who will inform me through the instructors.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
To this I replied saying that I claimed no authority, that in the
military sense I was no more than any other private, but that I had
believed that as Chairman of the Volunteer Corps, I should be allowed
unofficially to act as their representative. I also set out the
grievances and requests that had been brought to my notice,  namely, 
that grievous dissatisfaction had been caused by the appointment  of 
section leaders without reference to the feeling of the members of
the corps; that they be recalled, and the Corps be invited to elect
section leaders, subject to the Commander’s approval.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
This did not appeal to the Commanding Officer, who said it was
repugnant to all military discipline that the section leaders should
be elected by the Corps, and that the recall of appointments already
made would be subversive of all discipline.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So we held a meeting and decided upon withdrawal<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4</font>.
I brought home to the members the serious consequences of satyagraha.
But a very large majority voted for the resolution, which was to the
effect that, unless the appointments of Corporals already made were
recalled and the members of the Corps given an opportunity of
electing their own Corporals, the members would be obliged to abstain
from further drilling and week-end camping.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I then addressed a letter to the Commanding Officer telling him what
a severe disappointment his letter rejecting my suggestion had been.
I assured him that I was not fond of any exercise of authority and
that I was most anxious to serve<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5</font>.
I also drew his attention to a precedent. I pointed out that,
although I occupied no offical rank in</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
the South African Indian Ambulance Corps at the time of the Boer War,
there was never a hitch between Colonel Gallwey and the Corps, and
the Colonel never took a step without reference to me with a view to
ascertain the wishes of the Corps. I also enclosed a copy of the
resolution we had passed the previous evening.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
This had no good<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T6 </font>effect
on the officer, who felt that the meeting and the resolution were a
grave breach of discipline.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Hereupon I addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for India,
acquainting him with all the facts and enclosing a copy of the
resolution. He replied explaining that conditions in South Africa
were different, and drawing my attention to the fact that under the
rules the section commanders were appointed by the Commanding
Officer, but assuring me that in future, when appointing section
commanders, the Commanding Officer would consider my recommendations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
A good deal of correspondence<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>passed between us after this, but I do not want to
prolong the bitter tale. Suffice it to say that my experience was of
a piece with the experiences we daily have in India. What with
threats and what with adroitness the Commanding Officer succeeded in
creating a division in our Corps. Some of those who had voted for the
resolution yielded to the Commander’s threats or persuasions and
went back on their promise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
About this time an unexpectedly large contingent of wounded soldiers
arrived at the Netley Hospital, and the services of our Corps were
requisitioned. Those whom the Commanding Officer could persuade went
to Netley. The others refused to go.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T7
</font>I was on my back, but was in communication with the members of
the Corps.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T8 </font>Mr. Roberts,
the Under-Secretary of State, honoured me with many calls during
those days. He insisted on my persuading the others to serve. He
suggested that they should form a separate Corps and that at the
Netley Hospital they could be responsible only  to  the  Commanding
Officer there, so that there would be no question of loss of
self-respect, Government would be be placated, and at the same time
helpful service would be rendered to the large number  of wounded
received at the hospital. This suggestion appealed both to my
companions and to me, with the result that those who had stayed away
also went to Netley.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">

GOKHALE’S CHARITY</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
I have already referred to the attack of pleurisy I had  in England.
Gokhale returned to London soon after. Kallenbach and I used
regularly to go to him. Our talks were mostly about the War, and as
Kallenbach had the geography of Germany at his fingertips, and had
travelled much in Europe, he used to show him on the map the various
places in connection with the War.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
When I got pleurisy this also became a topic of daily discussion. My
dietetic experiments were going on even then. My diet consisted,
among other things, of groundnuts, ripe and unripe bananas, lemon,
olive oil, tomatoes and grapes. I completely eschewed milk, cereals,
pulses and other things.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Jivraj Mehta treated me. He pressed me hard to resume milk and
cereals, but I was obdurate. The matter reached Gokhale’s ears.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1
</font>He had not much regard for my reasoning in favour of a
fruitarian diet, and he wanted me to take whatever the doctor
prescribed for my health.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was no easy thing for me not to yield to Gokhale’s pressure.
When he would not take a refusal, I begged him to give me twenty-
four hours for thinking over the question. As Kallenbach and  I
returned home that evening, we discussed where my duty lay. He had
been with me in my experiment. He liked it, but I saw that he was
agreeable to my giving it up if my health demanded it. So I had to
decide for myself according to the dictates of the inner voice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I spent the whole night thinking over the matter. To give up the
experiment would mean renouncing all my ideas in that direction, and
yet I found no flaw in them. The question was how far I should yield
to Gokhale’s loving pressure, and how far I might modify my
experiment in the so-called<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2
</font>interests of health. I finally decided to adhere to the
experiment in so far as the motive behind was chiefly religious, and
to yield to the doctor’s advice where the motive was mixed.
Religious considerations had been predominant in the giving up of
milk. I had before me a picture of the wicked processes the <i>govals
</i>in Calcutta adopted to extract the last drop of milk from their
cows and buffaloes. I also had the feeling that, just as meat was not
man‘s food, even so animal’s milk could not be man’s food. So I
got up in the morning with the determination to adhere to my resolve
to abstain from milk. This greatly relieved me. I dreaded to approach
Gokhale, but I trusted him to respect my decision.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In the evening Kallenbach and I called on Gokhale at the National
Liberal Club. The first question he asked me was : ‘Well,</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
have you decided to accept the doctor’s advice ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I gently but firmly<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3 </font>replied
: ‘I am willing to yield on all points except one about which I beg
you not to press me. I will not take milk, milk-products or meat. If
not to take these things should mean my death, I feel I had better
face it.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
‘It this your final decision ?’ asked Gokhale.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I am afraid I cannot decide otherwise,’ said I. ‘I know that
my decision will pain you, but I beg your forgiveness.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
With a certain amount of pain but with deep affection, Gokhale said :
‘I do not approve of your decision, I do not see any religion in
it. But I won’t press you any more.’ With these words he turned
to Dr. Jivraj Mehta and said : ‘Please don’t worry him any more.
Prescribe anything you like within the limit he has set for himself.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The doctor expressed dissent, but was helpless. He advised me to take
<i>mung </i>soup, with a dash of asafoetida in it. To this I agreed.
I took it for a day or two, but it increased my pain. As I did not
find it suitable, I went back to fruits and nuts. The doctor of
course went on with his external treatment. The latter somewhat
relieved my pain, but my restrictions were to him a sore handicap.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Meanwhile Gokhale left for home, as he could not stand the October
fogs<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4 </font>of London.</p>

TREATMENT OF PLEURISY</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
The persistence of the pleurisy caused some anxiety, but I knew that
the cure lay not in taking medicine internally but in dietetic
changes assisted by external remedies.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I called in Dr. Allinson of vegetarian fame, who treated diseases by
dietetic modifications and whom I had met in 1890.   He  thoroughly
overhauled me. I explained to him how I had pledged myself not to
take milk. He cheered me up and said : ‘You need not take milk. In
fact I want you to do without any fat for some days.’ He then
advised me to live on plain brown bread, raw vegetables such as beet,
radish, onion and other tubers and greens, and also fresh fruit,
mainly oranges. The vegetables were not to be cooked but merely
grated fine<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1</font>, if I could
not masticate them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I adopted this for about three days, but raw vegetables did not quite
suit me. My body was not in a condition to enable me to do full
justice to the experiment<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2</font>.
I was nervous about taking raw vegetables.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Allinson also advised me to keep all the windows of my room open
for the whole twenty-four hours, bathe in tepid water, have an oil
massage on the affected parts and a walk in the open for fifteen to
thirty minutes. I liked all these suggestions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
My room had French windows which, if kept wide open, would let in the
rain. The fanlight could not be opened. I therefore got the glass
broken, so as to let in fresh air, and I partially opened the windows
in a manner not to let in rain.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
All these measures somewhat improved my health, but did not
completely cure me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Lady Cecilia Roberts occasionally called on me. We became<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>friends. She wanted very much to persuade me to take milk. But
as I was unyielding, she hunted about for a substitute for milk. Some
friend suggested to her malted milk, assuring her quite unknowingly
that it was absolutely free from milk, and that it was a chemical
preparation with all the properties of milk. Lady Cecilia, I knew,
had a great regard for my religious scruples, and so I implicity
trusted her. I dissolved the powder in water and took it only to find
that it tasted just like milk. I read the label on the bottle, to
find, only too late, that it was a preparation of milk. So I gave it
up<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4</font>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I informed Lady Cecilia about the discovery, asking her not to worry
over it. She came post-haste to me to say how sorry she was. Her
friend had not read the label at all. I begged her not to be anxious
and expressed my regret that I could not avail myself of the thing
she had procured with so much trouble. I also assured her that I did
not at all feel upset or guilty over having taken milk under a
misappre- hension.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must skip over many other sweet reminiscences of my contact with
Lady Cecilia. I could think of many friends who have been a source of
great comfort to me in the midst of trials and disapp- ointments. One
who has faith reads in them the merciful providence of God, who thus
sweetens sorrow itself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Allinson, when he next called, relaxed his restrictions and
permitted me to have groundnut butter or olive oil for the sake of
fat, and to take the vegetables cooked, if I chose, with rice. These
changes were quite welcome, but they were far from giving me a
complete cure. Very careful nursing was still necessary, and I was
obliged to keep mostly in bed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Dr. Mehta occasionally looked in to examine me and held out a
standing offer to cure me if only I would listen to his advice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst things were going on in this way, Mr. Roberts one day came to
see me and urged me very strongly to go home. ‘You cannot possibly
go to Netley in this condition. There is still severer cold ahead of
us. I would strongly advise you to get back to India, for it is only
there that you can be completely cured. If, after your recovery, you
should find the War still going on, you will have many</p>

you have already done as by any means a mean contribution.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I accepted his advice ad began to make preparations for returning to
India.</p>

Mr. Kallenbach had accompanied me to England with a view to going to
India. We were staying together and of course wanted to sail by the
same boat<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1</font>. Germans,
however, were under such strict surveillance that we had our doubts
about Mr. Kallenbach getting a passport. I did my best to get it, and
Mr. Roberts, who was in favour of his getting his passport, sent a
cable to the Viceroy in this behalf. But straight came Lord
Hardinge’s reply : ‘Regret Government of India not prepared to
take any such risk.’ All of us understood the force of the reply.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was a great wrench for me to part from Mr. Kallenbach, but I could
see that his pang was greater. Could he have come to India, he would
have been leading today the simple happy life of a farmer and weaver.
Now he is in South Africa, leading his old life and doing brisk
business as an architect.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We wanted<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>a third-class
passage, but as there was none available on P. and O. boats, we had
to go second.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We took with us the dried fruit we had carried from South Africa, as
most of it would not be procurable on the boat, where fresh fruit was
easily available.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Jivraj Mehta had bandaged my ribs with ‘Mede’s Plaster’ and
had asked me not to remove it till we reached the Red Sea<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3</font>.
For two days I put up with the discomfort, but finally it became too
much for me. It was with considerable difficulty that I managed to
undo the plaster and regain the liberty of having a proper wash and
bath.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My diet consisted mostly of nuts and fruits. I found that I was
improving every day and felt very much better by the time we entered
the Suez Canal. I was weak, but felt entirely out of danger, and I
gradually went on increasing my exercise. The improvement I
attributed largely to the pure air of the temperate zone.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Whether it was due to past experience or to any other reason, I do
not know, but the kind of distance I notice between the English and
Indian passengers on the boat was something I had not observed even
on my voyage from South Africa.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4
</font>I did talk to a few Englishmen, but the talk was mostly
formal. There were hardly any cordial conversations such as had
certainly taken place on the South African boats<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5</font>.
The reason for this was, I think, to be found in the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
conscious or unconscious feeling at the back of the Englishman’s
mind that he belonged to the ruling race, and the feeling at the back
of the Indian’s mind that he belonged to the subject race.</p>

I was eager to reach home and get free from this atmosphere.</p>

On arriving at Aden we already began to  feel  somewhat  at home. We
knew the Adenwallas very well, having met Mr. Kekobad Kavasji Dinshaw
in Durban and come in close contact with him and his wife.</p>

Gokhale had inspired a reception for me in Bombay,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Before coming to a narrative of the course my life took in India, it
seems<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1 </font>necessary to
recall a few of the South African experiences which I have
deliberately left out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Some lawyer friends have asked me to give my reminiscences of the
bar. The number of these is so large that, if I were to describe them
all, they would occupy a volume by themselves and take me out of my
scope. But it may not perhaps be improper to recall some of those
which bear upon the practice of truth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So far as I can recollect, I have already said that I never resorted
to untruth in my profession, and that a large part of my legal
practice was in the interest of public work, for which I  charged 
nothing beyond out-of-pocket expenses, and these too I sometimes  met
 myself. I had thought that in saying this I had said all that was
necessary as regards my legal practice. But friends want me to do
more. They seem to think that, if I described how-</p>

ever slightly some of the occasions when I refused to swerve from the
truth, the legal profession might profit by it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As a student<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>I had heard
that the lawyer’s profession was a liar’s profession. But this
did not influence me, as I had no intention of earning either
position or money by lying.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My principle was put to the test many a time in South Africa. Often I
knew that my opponents had tutored their witnesses, and if I only
encouraged my client or his witnesses to lie, we could win the case.
But I always resisted the temptation. I remember only one</p>

There was one case which proved a severe trial. It was brought to me

entrusted by the court to the arbitration of some qualified
accountants.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5 </font>The award
was entirely in favour of my client, but the arbitrators had

was junior counsel for my client. When the senior counsel became
aware of the error, he was of opinion that our client was not bound
to admit it. He was clearly of opinion that no counsel was bound to
admit anything that  went  against his client’s interest. I said we
ought to admit the error.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But the senior counsel contended : ‘In that case there is every
likelihood of the court cancelling the whole award, and no sane 
counsel would imperil his client’s case to that extent. At any rate
I would be the last man to take any such risk. If the case were to be
sent up for a fresh hearing, one could never tell what expenses our
client might have to incur, and what the ultimate result might be !’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">
The client was present when this conversation took place.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I said : ‘I feel that both our client and we ought to run the risk.
Where is the certainty of the court<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>upholding a wrong award simply because we do not admit
the error ? And supposing the admission<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T8
</font></sup>were to bring the client to grief, what harm is there ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
‘But why should we make the admission at all ?’ said the senior
counsel.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
‘Where is the surety of the court not detecting the error or our
opponent not discovering it ?’ said I.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
‘Well then, will you argue the case ? I am not prepared to argue</p>

it on your terms,’ replied the senior counsel with decision.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I humbly answered : ‘If you will not argue, then I am prepared to
do so, if our client so desires. I shall have nothing to do with the
case if the error is not admitted.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
With this I looked at my client. He was a little embarrassed. I had
been in the case from the very first. The client fully trusted me,
and knew me through and through. He said : ‘Well, then, you will
argue the case and admit the error. Let us lose, if that is to be our
lot. God defends the right.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.49cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was delighted. I had expected nothing less from him. The senior
counsel again warned me, pitied me for my obduracy, but congratulated
me all the same.</p>

PRACTICE ?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
I had no doubt about the soundness of my advice, but I doubted very
much my fitness for doing full justice to the case. I felt it would
be a most hazardous undertaking to argue such a difficult case before
the Supreme Court, and I appeared before the Bench in fear and
trembling.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As soon as I referred to the error in the accounts, one of the judges
said :</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
‘Is not this sharp practice, Mr. Gandhi ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I boiled within to hear this charge. It was intolerable to be accused
of sharp practice when there was not the slightest warrant for it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘With a judge prejudiced from the start like this, there is little
chance of success in this difficult case,’ I said to myself. But I
composed my thoughts and answered :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘I am surprised that Your Lordship should suspect  sharp practice
without hearing me out.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘No question of a charge,’ said the judge. ‘It is a mere
suggestion.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The suggestion here seems to me to amount to a charge. I would ask
Your Lordship to hear me out and then arraign me if there is any
occasion for it.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I am sorry to have interrupted you,’ replied the judge. ‘Prey
do go on with your explanation of the discrepancy.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had enough material in support of my explanation. Thanks to the
judge having raised this question, I was able to rivet the Court’s
attention on my argument from the very start. I felt much encouraged</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 5%">
<br/>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
and took the opportunity of entering into a detailed explanation. The
Court gave me a patient hearing, and I was able to convince the
judges that the discrepancy was due entirely to inadvertence. They
therefore did not feel disposed to cancel the whole award, which had
involved considerable labour.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The opposing counsel seemed to feel secure in the belief that not
much argument would be needed after the error had been admitted. But
the judges continued to interrupt him, as they were convinced that
the error was a slip<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1 </font>which
could be easily rectified. The counsel laboured hard to attack the
award, but the judge who had originally started with the suspicion
had now come round definitely to my side.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘Supposing Mr. Gandhi had not admitted the error, what would you
have done ?’ he asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
‘It was impossible for us to secure the services of a more
competent and honest expert accountant than the one appointed by us.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The Court must presume that you know your case best. If you cannot
point out anything beyond  the slip which any expert accountant is
liable to commit, the Court will be loath to compel the parties to go
in for fresh litigation and fresh expenses because of a patent
mistake. We may not order a fresh hearing when such an error can be
easily corrected,’ continued the judge.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And so the counsel’s objection was overruled. The Court either
confirmed the award, with the error rectified, or ordered the
arbitrator to rectify the error, I forget which.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was delighted.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>So were
client and senior counsel; and I was confirmed in my conviction that
it was not impossible to practise law without compromising truth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Let the reader, however, remember that even truthfulness in the
practice of the profession cannot cure it of the fundamental defect
that vitiates it.</p>

CLIENTS TURNED CO-WORKERS</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
The distinction between the legal practice in Natal and that in the
Transvaal was that in Natal there was a joint bar; a barrister,
whilst he was admitted to the rank of advocate, could also practise
as an attorney; whereas in the Transvaal, as in Bombay, the spheres
of attorneys and advocates were distinct.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1
</font>A barrister had the right of election whether he would
practise as an advocate or as an attorney. So whilst in Natal I was
admitted as an advocate, in the Transvaal I sought admission as an
attorney. For as an advocate I could not have</p>

come in direct contact with the Indians and the white attorneys in
South Africa would not have briefed me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
But even in the Transvaal it was open to attorneys to appear before
magistrates. On one occasion, whilst I was conducting a case before a
magistrate in Johannesburg, I discovered that my client had deceived
me.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>I saw him completely
break down in the witness box. So without any argument I asked the
magistrate to dismiss the case. The opposing counsel was astonished,
and the magistrate was pleased. I rebuked my client for bringing a
false case to me. He knew that I never accepted false cases, and when
I brought the thing home to him, he admitted his mistake, and I have
an impression that he was not angry with me for having asked the
magistrate to decide against him. At any rate my conduct in this case
did not affect my practice for the worse, indeed it made my work
easier. I also saw that my devotion to truth enhanced my reputation
amongst the members of the profession, and in spite of the handicap
of colour I was able in some cases to win even their affection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
During my professional work it was also my habit never to conceal my
ignorance from my clients or my colleagues. Wherever I felt myself at
sea, I would advise my client to consult some other counsel, or if he
preferred to stick to me, I would ask him to let me seek the
assistance of senior counsel. This frankness earned me the unbounded
affection and trust of my clients. They were always willing to pay
the fee whenever consultation with senior counsel was necessary. This
affection and trust served me in good stead in my public work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
I have indicated in the foregoing chapters that my<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>object in practising in South Africa was service of the
community. Even for this purpose, winning the confidence of the
people was an indis-pensable condition. The large-hearted Indians
magnified into service professional work done for money, and when I
advised them to suffer the hardships of imprisonment for the sake of
their rights, many of them cheerfully accepted the advice, not so
much because they had reasoned out the correctness of the course, as
because of their confidence in, and affection for, me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
As I write this, many a sweet reminiscence comes to my mind. Hundreds
of clients became friends and real co-workers in public service, and
their association sweetened a life that was otherwise full of
difficulties and dangers.</p>

The reader, by now, will be quite familiar with Parsi Rustomji’s
name.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>He was
one who became at once my client and coworker, or perhaps it would be
truer to say that he first became co-worker and then client. I won
his confidence to such an extent that he sought and followed my
advice also in private domestic matters. Even when he was ill, he
would seek my aid, and though there was much difference between our
ways of living, he did not hesitate to accept my quack treatment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This friend once got into a very bad scrape. Though he kept me
informed of most of his affairs,<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2
</font>he had studiously kept back one thing. He was a large importer
of goods from Bombay and Calcutta, and not infrequently he resorted
to smuggling. But as he was on the best terms with customs officials,
no one was inclined to suspect him. In charging duty, they used to
take his invoices on trust. Some might even have connived at the
smuggling.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But to use the telling simile of the Gujarati poet Akho, theft like
quicksilver won’t be suppressed, and Parsi Rustomji’s proved no
exception. The good friend ran post-haste to me, the tears rolling
down his cheeks as he said : ‘Bhai, I have deceived you. My guilt
has been discovered today. I have smuggled and I am doomed. I must go
to jail and be ruined. You alone may be able to save me from this
predicament. I have kept back nothing else from you, but I thought I
ought not to bother you with such tricks of the trade, and so I never
told you about this smuggling. But now, how much I repent it !’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I calmed him and said : ‘To save or not to save you is in His
hands. As to me you know my way. I can but try to save you by means
of confession.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
The good Parsi felt deeply mortified.</p>

‘But is not my confession before you enough  ?’  he  asked. ‘You
have wronged not me but Government. How will the</p>

‘Of course I will do just as you advise, but will you not consult

went to his counsel. He perused the papers, and said : ‘The case
will be tried by a jury, and a Natal jury will be the last to acquit
an Indian. But I will not give up hope.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I did not know this counsel intimately. Parsi Rustomji intercepted :
‘I thank you, but I should like to be guided by Mr. Gandhi’s
advice in this case. He knows me intimately. Of course you will
advise him whenever necessary.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Having thus shelved the counsel’s question, we went to Parsi
Rustomji’s shop.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And now explaining my view I said to him : ‘I don’t think this
case should be taken to court at all. It rests with the Customs
Officer to prosecute you or to let you go, and he in turn will have
to be guided by the Attorney General. I am prepared to meet both.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>I propose that you should offer to pay the penalty they fix,
and the odds are that they will be agreeable. But if they are not,
you must be prepared to go to jail. I am of opinion that the shame
lies not so much in going to jail as in committing the offence. The
deed of shame has already been done. Imprisionment you should regard
as a penance. The real penance lies in resolving never to smuggle
again.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I cannot say that Parsi Rustomji took all this quite well. He was a
brave man, but his courage failed him for the moment. His name and
fame were at stake, and where would he be if the edifice he had
reared with such care and labour should go to pieces ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Well, I have told you,’ he said, ‘that I am entirely in your
hands. You may do just as you like.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I brought to bear on this case all my powers of persuasion. I met the
Customs Officer and fearlessly apprised him of the whole affair. I
also promised to place all the books at his disposal and told him how
penitent Parsi Rustomji was feeling.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Customs Officer said : ‘I like the old Parsi. I am sorry he has
made a fool of himself. You know where my duty lies. I must be guided
by the Attorney General and so I would advise you to use all your
persuasion with him.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
‘I shall be thankful<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T4</font>,‘
said I, ‘if you do not insist on dragging him into court.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Having got him to promise this, I entered into correspondence with
the Attorney General and also met him. I am glad to say that he
appreciated my complete frankness<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T5
</font>and was convinced that I had kept back nothing.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I now forget whether it was in connection with this or with some
other case that my persistence and frankness extorted from him the</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
remark:<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T6 </font>‘I see you
will never take a no for an answer.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The case against Parsi Rustomji was compromised. He was to pay a
penalty equal to twice the amount he had confessed to having
smuggled. Rustomji reduced to writing the facts of the whole case,
got the paper framed and hung it up in his office to serve as a
perpetual reminder to his heirs and fellow-merchants.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">

transitory contrition.<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T7 </font>When

Before I reached home, the party which had started  from phoenix had
already arrived. According to our original plan I was to have
preceded them, but my preoccupation in England with the War had upset
all our calculations, and when I saw that I had to be detained in
England indefinitely, I was faced with the question of finding a
place for accommodating the Phoenix party. I wanted them all to stay
together in India, if possible, and to live the life they had led at
Phoenix. I did not know<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T1 </font>of
any Ashram to which I could recommend them to go, and therefore
cabled<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T2 </font>to them to meet
Mr. Andrews and do as he advised.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
So they were first put in the Gurukul, Kangri, where the late Swami
Shraddhanandji treated them as his own children. After this they were
put in the Shantiniketan Ashram, where the Poet and his people
showered similar love upon them. The experiences they gathered at
both these places too stood them and me in good stead.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The Poet, Shraddhanandji and Principal Sushil Rudra, as I used to say
to Andrews, composed his trinity. When in South Africa he was never
tired of speaking of them, and of my many sweet memories of South
Africa, Mr. Andews’s talks, day in and day out, of this great
trinity, are amongst the sweetest and most vivid.  Mr.  Andrews
naturally put the Phoenix party<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">T3
</font>in touch also with Sushil Rudra. Principal Rudra had no
Ashram, but he had a home which he placed completely at the disposal
of the Phoenix family. Within a day of their arrival, his people made
them feel so thoroughly at home that they did not seem to miss
Phoenix at all.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
It was only when I landed in Bombay that I learnt that the Phoenix
party was at Shantiniketan. I was therefore impatient to meet them as
soon as I could after my meeting with Gokhale.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At the party given in my honour at Mr. Jehangir Petit’s place, I
did not dare to speak in Gujarati. In those palatial surroundings of
dazzling splendour I, who had lived my best life among indentured
labourers, felt myself a complete rustic. With my Kathiawadi cloak,
turban and dhoti, I looked somewhat more civilized than I do today,
but the pomp and splendour of Mr. Petit’s mansion made me feel
absolutely out of my element. However, I acquitted myself tolerably
well, having taken shelter under Sir Pherozeshah’s protecting wing.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Then there was the Gujarati function. The Gujaratis would not let me
go without a reception, which was organized by  the  late Uttamlal
Trivedi.<font size="1">T4 </font>I had acquainted myself with the
programme befor-ehand. Mr. Jinnah was present, being a Gujarati, I
forget whether as president or as the principal speaker.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>He
made a short and sweet little speech in English. As far as I remember
most of the other speeches were also in English. When my turn came, I
expressed my thanks in Gujarati explaining<font size="1">T5 </font>my
partiality for Gujarati and Hindu- stani, and entering my humble
protest against the use of English in a Gujarati gathering. This I
did, not without some hesitation, for I was afraid lest it should be
considered discourteous for an inexper-ienced man, returned home
after a long exile, to enter his protest against established
practices. But no one seemed to misunderstand my insistence on
replying in Gujarati. In fact I was glad to note that everyone seemed
reconciled to my protest.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The meeting thus emboldened me to think that I should not find it
difficult to place my <font size="1">T6 </font>new-fangled notions
before my coun- trymen.?v</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
After a brief stay in Bombay, full of these preliminary experiences,
I went to Poona whither Gokhale had summoned me.</p>

The moment I reached Bombay Gokhale sent me word that the Governor
was desirous of seeing me, and that it might be proper for me to
respond before I left for Poona. Accordingly I called on His
Excellency. After the usual inquiries, he said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">

‘I can very easily give the promise, inasmuch as it is my rule, as 
a satyagrahi, to understand the viewpoint of the party I propose to
deal with, and to try to agree with him as far as may be possible. I
strictly observed the rule in South Africa and I mean to do the same
here.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
Lord Willingdon thanked me and said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You may come to me whenever you like, and you will see that my

To which I replied. ‘It is that faith which sustains me.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
After this I went to Poona. It is impossible for me to set down all
the reminiscences of this precious<font size="1">T2 </font>time.
Gokhale and the members of the Servants of India Society overwhelmed
me with affection. So far as I recollect, Gokhale had summoned all of
them to meet me. I had a frank talk with them all on every sort of
subject.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 0.43cm">
Gokhale was very keen that I should join the Society and so was</p>

I.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>But the members felt that, as there was a great
difference between my ideals and methods of work and theirs, it might
not be proper for me to join the Society. Gokhale believed that, in
spite of my insistence on my own principles, I was equally ready and
able to tolerate theirs.<font size="1">T3</font><font size="1"> </font>‘But,’
he said ‘the members of the Society have not yet understood your
readiness for compromise. They  are   tenacious   of</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 86%">
their principles, and quite independent. I am hoping that they will
accept you, but if they don’t you will not for a moment think that
they are lacking in respect or love for you. They are hesitating to
take any risk lest their high regard for you should be jeopardized.
But whether you are formally admitted as a member or not, I am going
to look upon you as one.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
I informed Gokhale of my intentions. Whether I was admitted as a
member or not, I wanted to have an Ashram where I could settle down
with my Phoenix family, preferably somewhere in Gujarat as, being a
Gujarati, I thought I was best fitted to serve the country through
serving Gujarat. Gokhale liked the idea. He said: ‘You should
certainly do so. Whatever may be the result of your talks with the
members, you must look to me for the expenses of the Ashram, which  I
will regard as my own.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 95%">
My heart overflowed with joy. It was a pleasure to feel free from the
responsibility of raising funds, and to realize that I should not be
obliged to set about the work all on my own, but that I should be
able to count on a sure guide whenever I was in difficulty. This took
a great load off my mind.</p>

I now prepared to go to Shantiniketan. On the eve of my departure
Gokhale arranged a party of selected friends, taking good care to
order refreshments of my liking, i.e., fruits and nuts. The party was
held just a few paces from his room, and yet he was hardly in a
condition to walk across and attend it. But his affection for me got
the better of him and he insisted on coming. He came, but fainted<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

new thing with him and so when he came to, he sent word that we must
go on with the party.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
This party was of course no more than a conversazione in the open
space opposite the Society’s guesthouse, during which friends had
heart-to-heart chats over light refreshments of groundnuts, dates and
fresh fruits of the season.</p>

From Poona<font size="1">T1 </font>I went to Rajkot and Porbandar,
where I had to meet my brother’s widow and other relatives.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
During the satyagraha in South Africa I had altered my style of dress
so as to make it more in keeping with that of the indentured
labourers, and in England also I had adhered to the same style for
indoor use.<font size="1">T2 </font>For landing in Bombay I had a
Kathiawadi suit  of clothes consisting of a shirt, a dhoti, a cloak
and a white scarf; all made of Indian mill-cloth. But as I was to
travel third from Bombay, I regarded the scarf and the cloak as too
much of an encumbrance, so I shed them, and invested in an
eight-to-ten-annas Kashmiri cap. One dressed in that fashion was sure
to pass muster as a poor man.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On account of the plague prevailing at that time third-class pas-
sengers were being medically inspected at Viramgam or Wadhwan—I
forget which. I had slight fever. The inspector on finding that I had
a temperature asked me to report myself to the Medical  Officer  at
Rajkot and noted down my name.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Someone had perhaps sent the information that I was passing through
Wadhwan, for the tailor Motilal, a noted public worker of the place,
met me at the station. He told me about the Viramgam customs, and the
hardships railway passengers had to suffer on account of it. I had
little inclination to talk because of my fever, and tried to finish</p>

with a brief reply which took the form of a question : ‘Are you
prepared to go to jail?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 95%">
I had taken Motilal to be one of those impetuous youths who do not
think before speaking. But not so Motilal. He replied with firm
deliberation :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘We will certainly go to jail, provided you lead us. As
Kathiawadis, we have the first right on you. Of course we do not mean
to detain you now, but you must promise to halt here on your return.
You will be delighted to see the work and the spirit of our youths,
and you may trust us to respond as soon as you summon us.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
Motilal captivated me. His comrade eulogizing him, said:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Our friend is but a tailor. But he is such a master of his
profession that he easily earns Rs. 15 a month—which is just what
he needs—working an hour a day, and gives the rest of his time to
public work. He leads us all, putting our education to shame.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Later I came in close contact with Motilal, and I saw that there was
no exaggeration in the eulogy. He made a point of spending some days
in the then newly started Ashram every month to teach the children
tailoring and to do some of the tailoring of the Ashram himself. He
would talk to me every day of Viramgam, and the hardships of the
passengers, which had become absolutely unbearable for him. He was
cut off in the prime of youth by a sudden illness, and public life at
Wadhwan suffered without him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On reaching Rajkot, I reported myself to the Medical Officer the next
morning. I was not unknown there. The doctor felt ashamed and was
angry with the inspector. This was unnecessary, for the inspector had
only done his duty. He did not know me, and even if he had known me,
he should not have done otherwise. The Medical Officer would not let
me go to him again<font size="1">T3 </font>and insisted on sending  an 
inspector to me instead.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Inspection of third-class passengers for sanitary reasons is
essential on such occasions. If big men choose to travel third,
whatever their position in life, they must voluntarily submit
themselves to all the regulations that the poor are subject to, and
the officials ought to be impartial. My experience is that the
officials, instead of looking upon third-class passengers as
fellowmen, regard them as so many sheep. They talk to them
contemptuously, and brook no reply or argument. The third-class
passenger has to obey the official as though he were his servant, and
the latter may with impunity belabour and blackmail him, and book him
his ticket only after putting him to the greatest possible incon-
venience, including often missing the train. All this I have seen
with my own eyes. No reform is possible unless some of the</p>

educated and the rich voluntarily accept the status of the poor,
travel third, refuse to enjoy the amenities denied to the poor and,
instead of taking avoidable hardships, discourtesies and injustice<font size="1">T4

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Wherever I went in Kathiawad I heard complaints about the Viramgam
customs hardships. I therefore decided immediately  to make use of
Lord Willingdon’s offer. I collected and read all the literature
available on the subject, convinced myself that the com- plaints were
well-founded, and opened correspondence with the Bombay Government. I
called on the Private Secretary to Lord Willi- ngdon and waited on
His Excellency also. The latter expressed his sympathy but shifted
the blame on Delhi. ‘If it had been in our hands, we should have
removed the cordon long ago. You should approach the Government of
India,’ said the Secretary.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I communicated with the Government of India, but got no reply beyond
an acknowledgement. It was only when I had an occasion to meet Lord
Chelmsford latter<font size="1">T5 </font>that redress could be had.
When I placed the facts before him, he expressed his astonishment. He
had known nothing of the matter. He gave me a patient hearing,
telephoned that very moment for papers about Viramgam and promised to
remove the cordon if the authorities had no explanation of defence to
offer. Within a few days of this interview I read in the papers that
the Viramgam customs cordon had been removed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I regarded this event<font size="1">T6 </font>as the advent of
satyagraha in India. For during my interview with the Bombay
Government the Secretary had expressed his disapproval of a reference
to satyagraha in a speech which I had delivered in Bagasra (in
Kathiawad).<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

‘Is not this a threat?’ he had asked. ‘And do you think a
powerful Government will yield to threats?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘This was no threat,’ I had replied. ‘It was educating the
people. It is my duty to place before the people all the legiti- mate

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
From Rajkot I proceeded to Shantiniketan. The teachers and students  
overwhelmed   me   with   affection.   The   reception<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
      </font></sup>was   a beautiful combination of simplicity, art
and love. It was here I met Kakasaheb Kalelkar for the first time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I did not know then why Kalelkar was called ‘Kakasaheb’. But I
learnt later on that Sjt. Keshavrao Deshpande, who was a cont-
emporary and a close friend of mine in England, and who had cond-
ucted a school in the Baroda State called ‘Ganganath Vidyalaya’,
had given the teachers family names with a view to investing the
Vidyalaya with a family atmosphere. Sjt. Kalelkar who was a teacher
there came to be called ‘Kaka’ (literally, paternal uncle).
Phadke was called ‘Mamma’ (literally, maternal uncle), and
Harihar Sharma received the name ‘Anna’ (literally, brother).
Others also got similar names. Anandanand (Swami) as Kaka’s friend
and Patwardhan (Appa) as Mama’s friend later joined the family, and
all in course of time bec- ame my co-workers one after another. Sjt.
Deshpande himself used to be called ‘Saheb’. When the Vidyalaya
had to be dissolved, the family also broke up, but they never gave up
their spiritual relationship or their assumed names.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Kakasaheb went out to gain experience of different institutions, and
at the time I went to Shantiniketan, he happened to be there.
Chintaman Shastri, belonging to the same fraternity, was there also.
Both helped in teaching Samskrit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Phoenix family had been assigned separate quarters at Sha-
ntiniketan. Maganlal Gandhi was at their head, and he had made it his
business to see that all the rules of the Phoenix Ashram should be
scrupulously observed. I saw that, by dint of his love, knowledge and
perseverance, he had made his fragrance felt in the whole of
Shantiniketan.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Andrews was there, and also Pearson. Amongst the Bengali teachers
with whom we came in fairly close contact were Jagada- nandbabu,
Nepalbabu, Santoshbabu, Kshitimohanbabu, Nagenbabu, Sharadbabu and
Kalibabu.</p>

and engaged them in a discussion on self-help. I put it to the
teachers that, if they and the boys dispensed with the services of
paid cooks and cooked their food themselves, it would enable the
teachers to control the kitchen from the point of view of the boys’
physical and moral health, and it would afford to the students an
object-lession in self-help. One or two of them were inclined to
shake their heads. Some of them strongly approved of the proposal.
The boys welcomed it, if only because of their instinctive taste for
novelty. So we launched the experiment. When I invited the Poet to
express his opinion, he said that he did not mind it provided the
teachers were favourable. To the boys he said, ‘The experiment
contains the key to swaraj.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Pearson began to wear away his body in making the experiment a
success. He threw himself into it with zest. A batch was formed to
cut vegetables, another to clean the grain, and so on. Nagenbabu and
others undertook to see to the sanitary cleaning of the kitchen and
its surroundings. It was a delight to me to see them working spade in
hand. But it was too much to expect the hundred and twenty-five boys
with their teachers to take to this work of physical labour like
ducks to water. There used to be daily discussions. Some began early
to show fatigue. But Pearson was not the man to be tired. One would
always find him with his smiling face doing something or other in or
about the kitchen. He had taken upon himself the cleaning of the
bigger utensils. A party of students played on their sitar before
this cleaning party in order to beguile the tedium of the operation.
All alike took the thing up with zest and Shantiniketan became a busy
hive.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Changes like these when once begun always develop. Not only was the
Phoenix party’s kitchen self-conducted, but the food cooked in it
was of the simplest. Condiments were eschewed. Rice, dal, vegetables
and even wheat flour were all cooked at one and the same time in a
steam cooker. And Shantiniketan boys started a similar kitchen with a
view to introducing reform in the Bengali kitchen. One or two
teachers and some students ran this kitchen.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The experiment was, however, dropped after some time. I am of opinion
that the famous<font size="1">T1 </font>institution lost nothing  by 
having  conducted the experiment for a brief interval, and some of
the experiences gained could not but be of help to the teachers.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I had intended to stay at Shantiniketan for some time, but fate
willed otherwise. I had hardly been there a week when I received from
Poona a telegram announcing Gokhale’s death. Shantiniketan was
immersed in grief. All the members came over to me to express their
condolences. A special meeting was called in the Ashram temple<font size="1">T2
</font>to</p>

</font></sup>It was a solemn function. The same day I left for Poona
with my wife and Maganlal. All the rest stayed at Shantiniketan.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Andrews accompanied me up to Burdwan. ‘Do you think,’ he asked
me, ‘that a time will come for satyagraha in India ? And if so,
have you any idea when it will come ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is difficult to say,’ said I. ‘For one year I am to do
nothing. For Gokhale took from me a promise that I should travel in
India<font size="1">T3 </font>for gaining experience, and<font size="1">T4
</font>express no opinion on public questions until I have finished
the period of probation.<font size="1">T5 </font>Even after the year is

do not suppose there will be any occasion for satyagraha for five
years or so.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">I
may note in this connection that Gokhale used to laugh at some of my
ideas in <i>Hind Swaraj </i>or <i>Indian </i><i>Home Rule </i>and say
: ‘Aftrer you have stayed a year in India, your views will correct
themselves.’</p>

THIRD-CLASS PASSENGERS</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 95%">
At Burdwan we came face to face with the hardships that a third-
class passenger has to go through even in securing his ticket.
‘Third- class tickets are not booked so early,’ we were told. I
went to the Station Master, though that too was a difficult business.
Someone kindly directed me to where he was, and I represented to him
our difficulty. He also made the same reply. As soon as the booking
window opened, I went to purchase the tickets. But it was no easy
thing to get them. Might was right, and passengers, who were forward
and indifferent to others, coming one after another, continued to
push me out. I was therefore about the last of the first crowd to get
a ticket.<font size="1">T1</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The train arrived, and getting into it was another trial.<font size="1">T2
</font>There was a free exchange of abuse and pushes between
passengers al- ready in the train and those trying to get in.<font size="1">T3
</font>We ran up and down the platform, but were everywhere met with
the same reply : ‘No room here.’ I went to the guard. He said,
‘You must try to get in where you can or take the next train.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But I have urgent business,’ I respectfully replied. He had no
time to listen to me. I was disconcerted. I told Maganlal to get in
wherever possible, and I got into an inter-class compartment with my
wife. The guard saw us getting in. At Asansol station he came to
charge us excess fares. I said to him :</p>

‘It was your duty to find us room. We could not get any, and so we
are sitting here. If you can acommodate us in a third class
compartment, we shall be only too gald to go there.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
‘You may not argue with me,’ said the guard. ‘I cannot
accommodate you. You must pay the excess fare, or get out.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I wanted to reach Poona somehow. I was not therefore prepared to
fight the guard, so I paid the excess fare he demanded, i.e., up to
Poona. But I resented the injustice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
In the morning we reached Mogalsarai. Maganlal had managed to get a
seat in the third class, to which I now shifted. I acquainted the
ticket examiner with all the facts, and asked him to give me a 
certificate to the effect that I had shifted to a thirdclass
compartment at Mogalsarai. This he declined to do. I applied<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
the railway auth- oritities for redress and got a reply to this
effect : ‘It is not our practice to refund excess fares without the
production of a certificate, but we make an exception in your case.
It is not possible, however, to refund the excess fare from Burdwan
to Mogalsarai.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Since this I have had experiences of third-class travelling which, if
I wrote them all down, would easily fill a volume. But I can only
touch on them casually in these chapters. It has been and always will
be my profound regret that physical incapacity  should  have
compelled me to give up third-class travelling.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The woes of third-class passengers are undoubtedly due to the
high-handedness of railway authorities. But the rudeness, dirty
habits, selfishness and ignorance of the passengers<font size="1">T4
</font>themselves are no less to blame. The pity is that they often
do not realize that they are behaving ill, dirtily or selfishly. They
believe that everything they do is in the natural way. All this may
be traced to the indifference towards them of us ‘educated’
people.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We reached Kalyan dead tired. Maganlal and I got some water from the
station water-pipe and had our bath. As I was proceeding to arrange
for my wife’s bath, Sjt. Kaul of the Servants of India Society
recognizing us came up. He too was going to Poona. He offered to take
my wife to the second-class bath-room. I hesitated to accept the
courteous offer. I knew that my wife had no right to avail herself of
the second-class bath-room, but I ultimately connived at the
impropriety. This, I know, does not become a votary of truth. Not
that my wife was eager to use the bath-room, but a husband’s
partiality for his wife got the better of his partiality for truth.

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
On arrival in Poona, we found ourselves, after the performance of the
<i>shraddha </i>ceremonies, discussing the future of the Society,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>and the question as to whether I should join it or
not. This question of membership proved a very delicate matter for me
to handle. Whilst Gokhale was there I did not have to seek admission
as a member. I had simply to obey this wish, a position I loved to be
in. Launching on the stormy sea of Indian public life, I was in need
of a sure pilot. I had had one in Gokhale and had felt secure in his
keeping. Now that he was gone, I was thrown on my own resources, and
I felt that it was my duty to seek admission. That, I thought, would
please Gokhale’s spirit. So, without hesitation and with firmness,
I began the wooing.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Most of the members of the Society were in Poona at this juncture. I
set about pleading with them and tried to dispel their fears about
me. But I saw that they were divided. One section favoured my
admission, the other was strongly against it. I knew  that  neither
yielded to the other in its affection for me, but possibly their
loyalty to the Society was greater, at any rate not less than their
love for me. All our discussions were therefore free from bitterness,
and strictly confined to matters of principle. The section that was
opposed to me held that they and I were as the poles asunder in
various vital matters, and they felt<font size="1">T2 </font>my
membership was likely to imperil the very objects for which the
Society was founded<font size="1">T3</font>. This naturally was more
than they could bear.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
We dispersed after prolonged discussions, the final decision being
postponed to a later date.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T4</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
I was considerably agitated as I returned home. Was it right for me
to be admitted by a majority vote ? Would it be consonant with my
loyalty to Gokhale ?<font size="1">T5 </font>I saw clearly that, when
there was such a sharp division amongst the members of the Society
over admitting me, by far the best course for me was to withdraw my
application for adm- ission and save those opposed to me from a
delicate situation. Therein I thought lay my loyalty to the Society
and Gokhale. The decision came to me in a flash, and immediately I
wrote to Mr. Shastri asking him not to have the adjuorned meeting at
all.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

I next went to Rangoon to meet Dr. Mehta, and on my way I halted at
Calcutta. I was the guest of the late Babu Bhupendranath Basu.
Bengali hospitality reached its climax here. In those days I was a
strict fruitarian, so all the fruits and nuts available in Calcutta
were ordered for me. The ladies of the house kept awake all night
skinning various nuts. Every possible care was taken in dressing
fresh fruit in the Indian style. Numerous delicacies were prepared
for my com- panions, amongst whom was my son Ramdas. Much as I could
appreciate this affectionate hospitality, I could not bear the
thought of a whole household being occupied in entertaining two or
three guests. But as yet I saw no escape from such embarrassing
attentions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
On the boat going to Rangoon I was a deck passenger. If excess of
attention embarrassed us in Sjt. Basu’s house, grossest
inattention, even to the elementary comforts of deck passengers was
our lot on the boat. What was an apology for a bath-room was
unbearably dirty, the latrines were stinking sinks. To use the
latrine one  had  to  wade through urine and excreta or jump over
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
This was more than flesh and blood could bear. I approached the Chief
Officer without avail. If anything was lacking to complete the
picture of stink and filth, the passengers furnished it by their
thou- ghtless habits. They spat where they sat, dirtied the
surroundings with the leavings of their food, tobacco and betel
leaves. There was no end to the noise, and everyone tried to
monopolize as much room as possible.<font size="1">T1 </font>Their
luggage took up more room than they. We had thus two days of the
severest trial.</p>

unbearable.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In Rangoon my fruitarian diet was again a source of additional
trouble to the host. But since Dr. Mehta’s home was as good as my
own, I could control somewhat the lavishness of the menu. However, as
I had not set any limit to the number of articles I might eat, the
palate and the eyes refused to put an effective check on the supply
of varieties ordered. There were no regular hours for meals.
Personally I preferred having the last meal before nightfall.
Nevertheless as a rule it could not be had before eight or nine.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This year—1915—was the year of the Kumbha fair, which is held at
Hardvar once every 12 years. I was by no means eager to attend the
fair, but I was anxious to meet Mahatma Munshiramji who was in his
Gurukul. Gokhale’s Society had sent a big volunteer corps for
service at the Kumbha. Pandit Hridayanath Kunzru was at the head, and
the late Dr. Dev was the medical officer. I was invited to send the
Phoenix party to assist them, and so Maganlal Gandhi had already
preceded me. On my return from Rangoon, I joined the band.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The journey from Calcutta to Hardvar was particularly trying.
Sometimes the compartments had no lights. From Saha- ranpur we were
huddled into carriages for goods or cattle. These had no roofs, and
what with the blazing midday sun overhead and the scorching iron
floor beneath, we were all but roasted. The pangs of thirst, caused
by even such a journey as this, could not persuade orthodox Hindus to
take water, if it was ‘Mussalmani’. They waited until they could
get the ‘Hindu’ water. These very Hindus, let it be noted, do not
so much as hesitate or inquire when during illness the doctor
administers them wine or prescribes beef tea or a Mussalman or
Christian compounder gives them water.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Our stay in Shantiniketan had taught us that the scavenger’s work
would be our special function in India. Now for the volunteers in
Hardvar tents had been pitched in a dharmsala, and Dr. Dev had dug
some pits to be used as latrines. He had had to depend on paid
scavengers for looking after these. Here was work for the Phoenix
party. We offered to cover up the excreta with earth and to see to
their disposal, and Dr. Dev gladly accepted our offer. The offer  was
naturally made by me, but it was Maganlal Gandhi who had to execute
it. My business was mostly to keep sitting in the tent giving <i>darshan
</i>and holding religious and other discussions with numerous
pilgrims who called on me.<font size="1">T2 </font>This left me not a

But this was no enviable position to be in. I felt as though I was

one recognized me, I had to put up with the hardships that fall to
the lot of the millions in this land, e.g., in railway travelling.
Where I was surrounded by people who had heard of me I was the victim
of their craze for <i>darshan</i>. Which of the two conditions was
more pitiable, I have often been at a loss to determine. This at
least I know that the <i>darshan-walas</i>’ blind love has often
made me angry, and more often sore at heart. Whereas travelling,
though often trying, has been uplifting and has hardly ever roused me
to anger.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was in those days strong enough to roam about a lot, and was
fortunately not so known as not to be able to go in the streets
without creating much fuss. During these roamings I came to observe
more of the pilgrims’ absent-mindedness, hypocrisy and
slovenliness, than of their piety. The swarm of sadhus, who had
descended there, seemed to have been born but to enjoy the good
things of life. Here  I  saw  a  cow with five feet ! I was
astonished, but knowing men soon disill- usioned me. The poor
five-footed cow was a sacrifice to the greed of the wicked. I learnt
that the fifth foot was nothing else but a foot cut off from a live
calf and grafted upon the shoulder of the cow ! The result of this
double cruelty was exploited to fleece the ignorant of their money.
There was no Hindu but would be attracted by a five- footed cow, and
no Hindu but would lavish his charity on such a mir- aculous cow.</p>

The day of the fair was now upon us. It proved a red-letter day for
me.<font size="1">T5 </font>I had not gone to Hardvar with the
sentiments of a pilgrim. I have never thought of frequenting places
of pilgrimage in search of piety. But the seventeen lakhs of men that
were reported to be there could not all be hypocrites or mere
sight-seers. I had no doubt that countless people amongst them had
gone there to earn merit and for selfpurification. It is difficult,
if not imossible, to say to what extent this kind of faith uplifts
the soul.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
I therefore passed the whole night immersed in deep thought. There
were those pious souls in the midst of the hypocrisy that surrounded
them. They would be free of guilt before their Maker. If the visit to
Hardvar was in itself a sin, I must publicly protest against it, and
leave Hardvar on the day of Kumbha. If the pilgrimage to</p>

Hardvar and to the Kumbha fair was not sinful, I must impose some act
of self-denial on myself in atonement for the iniquity prevailing
there and purify myself.<font size="1">T6 </font>This was quite natural
for me. My life is based on disciplinary resolutions. I thought  of 
the  unnecessary trouble I had caused to my hosts at Calcutta and
Rangoon, who had so lavishly entertained me.<font size="1">T7 </font>I
therefore decided to limit the articles of my daily diet and to have
my final meal before sunset. I was convi- nced that, if I did not
impose these restrictions on myself, I should put my future hosts to
considerable inconvenience and should engage them in serving me
rather than engage myself in service. So I pledged myself never
whilst in India<font size="1">T8 </font>to take more than five articles
in twenty- four hours, and never to eat after dark. I gave the
fullest thought to the difficulties I might have to face. But I 
wanted  to  leave  no loophole. I rehearsed to myself what would
happen during an illness, if I counted medicine among the five
articles, and made no exception in favour of special articles of
diet. I finally decided that there should be no exception on any
account whatsoever.</p>

I have been under these vows for now thirteen years. They have
subjected me to a severe test, but I am able to testify that<font size="1">T9

It was a positive relief to reach the Gurukul and meet Mahatma
Munshiramji with his giant frame. I at once felt the wonderful
contrast between the peace of the Gurukul and the din and noise of
Hardvar.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Mahatma overwhelmed me with affection. The <i>brahm- acharis </i>were
all attention. It was here that I was first introduced to Acharya
Ramadevji, and I could immediately see what a force and a power he
must be. We<font size="1">T1 </font>had different viewpoints in several
matters, nevertheless our acquaintance soon ripened into friendship.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had long discussions with Acharya Ramadevji and other professors

We had discussions about religion and he realized that I felt deeply
about matters of religion.<font size="1">T5 </font>He saw me
bare-headed and shirtless as I had returned from my bath in the
Ganges. He was pained to miss the <i>shikha </i>(tuft of hair) on my
head and the sacred thread about my neck and said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It pains me to see you, a believing Hindu, going without a sacred
thread and the <i>shikha</i>. These are the two external symbols of
Hinduism and every Hindu ought to wear them.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Now there is a history as to how I came to dispense with both.<font size="1">T6
</font>When I was an urchin of ten, I envied the Brahmin lads<font size="1">T7
</font>sporting bunches of keys tied to their sacred threads, and I
wished I could do likewise. The practice of wearing the sacred thread
was not then common among the Vaishya families in Kathiawad. But a
movement had just been started for making it obligatory for the 
first  three varnas. As a result several members of the Gandhi clan
adopted the sacred thread. The Brahmin who was teaching two or three
of us boys <i>Ram </i><i>Raksha </i>invested us with the thread, and
although I had no occasion to possess a bunch of keys, I got one and
began to sport it. Later, when the thread gave way, I do not remember
whether I missed it very much. But I know that I did not go in for a
fresh one.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
As I grew up several well-meaning attempts were made both in India
and South africa to re-invest me with the sacred thread, but with
little success. If the shudras may not wear it, I argued, what right
have the other varnas to do so ? And I saw no adequate reason for
adopting what was to me an unnecessary custom.<font size="1">T8 </font>I
has no objection to the thread as such, but the reasons for wearing
it were lacking.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As a Vaishnava I had naturally worn round my neck the <i>kanthi</i>,
and the <i>shikha </i>was considered obligatory by elders. On the eve
of my going to England, however, I got rid of the <i>shikha</i>, lest
when I was bare-headed it should expose me to ridicule and make me
look, as I then thought, a barbarian in the eyes of the Englishmen.
In fact this cowardly feeling carried me so far that<font size="1">T9
</font>in South Africa I got my cousin Chhaganlal Gandhi who was
religiously wearing the <i>shikha</i>, to do away with it. I feared
that it might come in the way of his public work and so, even at the
risk of paining him, I made him get rid of it.<font size="1">T10</font></p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I therefore made a clean breast of the whole matter to the Swami and
said :</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I will not wear the sacred thread, for I see no necessity for it,
when countless Hindus can go without it and yet remain Hindus.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 5%">

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Moreover, the sacred thread should be a symbol of spiritual regen-
eration, presupposing a deliberate attempt on the part of the wearer
at a higher and purer life. I doubt whether in the present state of
Hinduism and of India, Hindus can vindicate the right to wear a
symbol charged with such a meaning.<font size="1">T11 </font>That right
can come only after Hinduism has purged itself of untouchability, has
removed all distinctions of superiority and inferiority, and shed as
host of other evils and shames that have become rampant in it.<font size="1">T12
</font>My mind ther- efore rebels against the idea of wearing the
sacred thread. But I am sure your suggestion about the <i>shikha </i>is
worth considering. I once used to have it, and I discarded it from a
false sense of shame<font size="1">T13 </font>. And so I feel that I
should start growing it again. I shall discuss the matter with my
comrades.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The Swami did not appreciate my position with regard to the sacred
thread. The very reasons that seemed to me to point to not wearing it
appeared to him to favour its wearing. Even today my position remains
about the same as it was at Hrishikesh. So long as there are
different religions, every one of them may need some outward
distinctive symbol. But when the symbol is made into a fetish and an
instrument of proving the superiority of one’s religion over
others’, it is fit only to be discarded. The sacred thread does not
appear to me today to be a means of uplifing Hinduism.  I  am
therefore indifferent to it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
As for the <i>shikha</i>, cowardice having been the reason for
discar- ding it, after consultation with friends I decided to re-grow
it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
But to return to Lakshman Jhula. I was charmed with the natural
scenery about Hrishikesh and the Lakshman Jhula, and bowed my head in
reverence to our ancestors for their sense of the beautiful in
Nature, and for their foresight in investing beautiful manifestations
of Nature with a religious significance.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
But the way in which men were using these beauty spots was far from
giving me peace. As at Hardvar, so at Hrishikesh, people dirtied the
roads and the fair banks of the Ganges. They did not even hesitate to
desecrate the sacred water of the Ganges. It filled me with agony to
see people performing natural functions on the thoroughfares and
river banks, when they could easily have gone a little farther away
from public haunts.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Lakshman Jhula was, I saw, nothing but an iron suspension bridge over
the Ganges.<font size="1">T4 </font>I was told that originally there
had been a fine rope-bridge. But a philanthropic Marwadi got it into
his head to destroy the rope-bridge and erect an iron one at a heavy
cost and then entrusted the keys to the Government! I am at a loss to
say anything</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
about the rope-bridge as I have never seen it, but the iron bridge is
entirely out of place in such surroundings and mars their beauty. The
making over of the keys of this pilgrims’ bridge to Government was
too much even for my loyalty of those days.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The svargashram which one reaches after crossing the bridge was a
wretched place, being nothing but a number of shabbylooking sheds of
galvanized iron sheets. These, I was told, were made for <i>sa-
dhakas </i>(aspirants). There were hardly any living there at the
moment. Those who were in the main building gave one an unfavourable
impression.<font size="1">T15</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But the Hardvar experiences proved for me to be of inestimable value.
They helped me in no small way to decide where I was to live and what
I was to do.</p>

FOUNDING OF THE ASHRAM</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
The pilgrimage to the Kumbha fair was my second visit to Hardvar.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Satyagraha Ashram was founded on the 25th of May, 1915.
Shraddhanandji wanted me to settle in Hardvar. Some of my Calcutta
friends recommended Vaidyanathadham. Others strongly urged me to
choose Rajkot. But when I happened to pass through Ahmedabad, many
friends pressed me to settle down there, and they volunteered to find
the expenses of the Ashram, as well as a house for us to live in.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I had a predilection for Ahmedabad. Being a Gujarati I thought I
should be able to render the greatest service to the country through
the Gujarati language. And then, as Ahmedabad was an ancient centre
of handloom weaving, it was likely to be the most favourable field
for the revival of the cottage industry of hand-spinning. There was
also the hope that, the city being the capital of Gujarat, monetary
help from its wealthy citizens would be more available here than
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The question of untouchability was naturally among the subjects
discussed with the Ahmedabad friends. I made it clear to them that I
should take the first opportunity of admitting an untouchable
candidate to the Ashram if he was otherwise worthy.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘Where is the untouchable who will satisfy your condition ?’ said
a Vaishnava friend self-complacently.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
I finally decided to found the Ashram at Ahmedabad.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So far as accommodation was concerned, Sjt. Jivanlal Desai, a
barrister in Ahmedabad, was the principal man to help me. He offered
to let, and we decided to hire, his Kochrab bungalow.<font size="1">T1</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The first thing we had to settle was the name of the Ashram. I
consulted friends. Amonst the names suggested were ‘Sevashram’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
(the abode of service). ‘Tapovan’ (the abode of austerities),
etc. I liked the name ‘Sevashram’ but for the absence of emphasis
on the method of service. ‘Tapovan’ seemed to be a pretentious
title, because though <i>tapas </i>was dear to us we could not
presume to be <i>tapasvins </i>(men of austerity). Our creed was
devotion to truth, and our business was the search for and insistence
on truth. I wanted to acquaint India with the method I had tried in
south Africa, and I desired to test in India the extent to which its
application might be possible. So my companions and I selected the
name ‘Satyagraha Ashram’, as conv- eying both our goal and our
method of service.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
For the conduct of the Ashram a code of rules and obser- vances was
necessary. A draft<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>was
therefore  prepared,  and  friends were invited to express their
opinions on it. Amongst the many</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
opinions that were received, that of Sir Gurudas Benerji is still in
my memory. He liked the rules, but suggested that humility should be
added as one of the observances, as he believed that the younger
generation sadly lacked humility. Though I noticed this fault, I
feared humility would cease to be humility the moment it became a
matter of vow. The true connotation of humility is self-effacement.
Self- effacement is <i>moksha </i>(salvation), and whilst it cannot,
by itself, be an observance, there may be other observances necessary
for its attainment. If the acts of an aspirant after <i>moksha </i>or
a servant have no humility or selflessness about them, there is no
longing for <i>moksha </i>or service. Service without humility is
selfishness and egotism.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were at this time about thirteen Tamilians in our party. Five
Tamil youngsters had accompanied me from South Africa, and the rest
came from different parts of the country. We were in all about
twenty-five men and women.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.48cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This is how the Ashram was started. All had their meals in a common
kitchen and strove to live as one family.</p>

The Ashram had been in existence only a few months when we were put
to a test such as I had scarcely expected. I received a letter from
Amritlal Thakkar to this effect : ‘A humble and honest untouchable
family is desirous of joining your Ashram. Will you accept them ?’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was perturbed. I had never expected that an untouchable family with
an introduction from no less a man than Thakkar Bapa would so soon be
seeking admission to the Ashram. I shared the letter</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I wrote to Amritlal Thakkar expressing our willingness to accept the
family, provided all the members were ready to abide by the rules of
the Ashram.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The family consisted of Dudabhai, his wife Danibehn and their
daughter Lakshmi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>,
then a mere toddling babe. Dudabhai had been a teacher in Bombay.
They all agreed to abide by the rules and were accepted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But their admission created a flutter amongst the friends who had
been helping the Ashram. The very first difficulty was found with
regard to the use of the well, which was partly controlled by the
owner of the bungalow. The man in charge of the water- lift objected
that drops of water from our bucket would pollute him. So he took to
swearing at us and molesting Dudabhai. I told everyone to put up with
the abuse and continue drawing water at any cost. When he saw that we
did not return his abuse, the man became ashamed and ceased to bother
us.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
All monetary help, however, was stopped. The friend who had asked
that question about an untouchable being able to follow the rules of
the Ashram had never expected that any such would be forthcoming.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
With the stopping of monetary help came rumours of proposed social
boycott. We were prepared for all this. I had told  my companions
that, if we were boycotted and denied the usual facilities, we would
not leave Ahmedabad. We would rather go and stay in the untouchables’
quarter and live on<font size="1">T1 </font>whatever we could get by
manual labour.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Matters came to such a pass that Maganlal Gandhi one day gave me this
notice : ‘We are out of funds and there is nothing for the next
month.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I quietly replied : ‘Then we shall go to the untouchables’
quarter.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This was not the first time I had been faced with such a trial. On
all such occasions God has sent help at the last moment. One morning,
shortly after Maganlal had given me warning of our monetary plight,
one of the children came and said that a Sheth<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

went out to him. ‘I want to give the Ashram some help. Will you

I had never expected this help, and what a novel way of  rendering
it! The gentleman had never before visited the Ashram. So far as I
can remember, I had met him only once.  No  visit,  no enquiries,
simply rendering help and going away ! This was a unique experience
for me. The help deferred the exodus to the untouchables’ quarter.
We now felt quite safe for a year.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Just as there was a storm outside, so was there a storm in the Ashram
itself. Though in South Africa untouchable friends used to come to my
place and live and feed with me, my wife and other women did not seem
quite to relish the admission into the Ashram of the untouchable
friends. My eyes and ears easily detected their indifference, if not
their dislike, towards Danibehn. The monetary difficulty had caused
me no anxiety, but this internal storm was more than I could bear.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>Danibehn was an ordinary woman. Dudabhai was a man
with slight education but of good understanding. I liked his
patience. Sometimes he did flare up, but on the whole I was well
impressed with his forbearance. I pleaded with him to swallow minor
insults. He not only agreed, but prevailed upon his wife to do
likewise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The admission of this family proved a valuable lesson to the Ashram.
In the very beginning we proclaimed to the world that the Ashram
would not countenance untouchability. Those who wanted to help the
Ashram were thus put on their guard, and the work of the Ashram in
this direction was considerably simplified. The fact that it is
mostly the real orthodox Hindus who have met the daily growing exp-
enses of the Ashram is perhaps a clear indication that
untou-chability is shaken to its foundation. There are indeed many
other proofs of this, but the fact that good Hindus do not scruple to
help an Ashram where we go to the length of dining with the
untouchables is no small proof.</p>

that follow will also suffer from the same drawback. I shall have to
omit important details, because most of the characters in the drama
are still alive, and it is not proper without permission to use their

hardly practicable to obtain their consent or to get them every now

fear that the rest of the story, valuable as it is in my opinion to

ABOLITION OF INDENTURED EMIGRATION</font><font size="1">T1</font></font></p>

We shall, for a moment, take leave of the Ashram, which in the very
beginning had to weather internal and external  storms,  and briefly
advert to a matter that engaged my attention.<font size="1">T2</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Indentured labourers were those who had emigrated from India to
labour under an indenture for five years or less. Under the Smuts-
Gandhi Settlement of 1914,<font size="1">T3 </font>the £3 tax in
respect of the indentured emigrants to Natal had been abolished, but
the general emigration from India still needed treatment.<font size="1">T4</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In March 1916 Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviyaji moved a resolution in the
Imperial Legislative Council for the abolition of the indenture
system. In accepting the motion Lord Harding announced that he had
‘obtained from His Majesty’s Government the promise of the
abolition in due course’ of the system. I felt, however, that India
could not be satisfied with so very vague an assurance, but ought to
agitate for immediate abolition.<font size="1">T5 </font>India had
tolerated the system thro- ugh her sheer negligence, and I believed
the time had come when people could successfully agitate for this
redress. I met some of the leaders, wrote in the Press<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>and saw that public opinion was solidly in favour of
immediate abolition. Might this be a fit subject for saty- agraha ? I
had no doubt that it was, but I did not know the <i>modus </i><i>operandi</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In the meantime the Viceroy had made no secret of<font size="1">T6 </font>the
 meaning of ‘the eventual abolition,’ which, as he said, was
abolition ‘within such reasonable time as will allow of alternative
arrangements being introduced.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So in February 1917, Pandit Malaviyaji asked for leave to introduce a
bill for the immediate abolition of the system. Lord</p>

Chelmsford refused permission. It was time for me to tour the country
for an all-India agitation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Before I started the agitation I thought it proper to wait upon the
Viceroy. So I applied for an interview. He immediately granted it.
Mr. Maffey, now Sir John Maffey, was his private secretary. I came in
close contact with him. I had a satisfactory talk with Lord
Chelmsford who, without being definite, promised to be helpful.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I began my tour from Bombay. Mr. Jehangir Petit undertook to convene
the meeting under the auspices of the Imperial Citizenship
Association. The Executive Committee of the Association met irst for
fra-ming the resolutions to be moved at the meeting. Dr.  Stanley
Reed, Sjt. (now Sir) Lallubhai Samaldas, Sjt. Natarajan and Mr. Petit
were present at the Committee meeting. The discussion centred round
the fixing of the period within which the Government was to be asked
to abolish the system. There were three proposals, viz., for
abolition ‘as soon as possible’, abolition ‘by the 31st July’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, and ‘immediate abolition’. I was for a definite
date as we could then decide what to do if the Government failed to
aceede to our request within the time limit. Sjt. Lallubhai was for
‘immediate’ abolition. He said ‘immediate’ indicated a
shorter period than the 31st July. I explained that the people would
not understand the word ‘immediate’. If we wanted to get them to
do something, they must have a more definite word. Everyone would
interpret ‘immediate’ in his own way—Government one way, the
people another way. There was no question of misun- derstanding ‘the
31st of July’, and if nothing was done by that date, we could
proceed further. Dr. Reed saw the force of the argument, and
ultimately Sjt. Lallubhai also agreed. We adopted the 31st July as
the latest date by which the abolition should be announced,  a
resolution to that effect was passed at the public meeting, and mee-
tings throughout India resolved accordingly.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Mrs. Jaiji Petit put all her energies into the organization of a
ladies’ deputation to the Viceroy. Amongst the ladies from Bombay
who formed the deputation, I remember the names of Lady Tata and the
late Dilshad Begum. The deputation had a great effect.  The Viceroy
gave an encouraging reply.</p>

I visited Karachi, Calcutta and various other places. There were fine
meetings everywhere, and there was unbounded enthusiasm. I had not
expected anything like it when the agitation was launched.</p>

nothing to conceal, they did not molest me, nor did I cause them any

knew me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On one occasion the detectives disturbed me at several stations,
asked for my ticket and took down the number. I, of course, readily
replied to all the questions they asked. My fellow-passengers  had
taken me to be<font size="1">T8 </font>a ‘sadhu’ or a ‘fakir’.
When they saw that I was being molested at every station, they were
exas- perated and swore at the detectives. ‘Why are you worrying
the poor sadhu for nothing ?’ they protested. ‘Don’t you show
these scoundrels your ticket,’ they said addressing me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I said to them gently : ‘It is no trouble to show them my ticket.
They are doing their duty<font size="1">T9</font>’. The passengers
were not satisfied, they evinced more and more sympathy, and strongly
objected to this sort of ill-treatment of innocent men.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But the detectives were nothing. The real hardship was the third-
class travelling. My bitterest experience was from Lahore to Delhi. I
was going to Calcutta from Karachi <i>via </i>Lahore where I had to
change trains. It was impossible to find a place in the train. It was
full and those who could get in did so by sheer force, often sneaking
through windows if the doors were locked. I had to reach Calcutta on
the date fixed for the meeting, and if I missed this train I could
not arrive in time. I had almost given up hope of getting in. No one
was willing to accept me, when a porter discovering my plight came to
me and said, ‘Give me twelve annas and I’ll get you a seat.’
‘Yes,’ said I, ‘You shall have twelve annas if you do procure
me a seat.’ The young man went from carriage to carriage entreating
passengers but no  one heeded him. As the train was about to start,
some passengers said, ‘There is no room here, but you can shove him
in here if you like. He will have to stand.’ ‘Well ?’ asked the
young porter. I readily agreed, and he shoved me in bodily through
the window. Thus I got in and the porter earned his twelve annas.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The night was a trial. The other passengers were sitting somehow. I
stood two hours, holding the chain of the upper bunk. Meanwhile some
of the passengers kept worrying me  incessantly. ‘Why will you not
sit down ?’ they asked. I tried to reason with them saying there
was no room but they could not tolerate my standing, though they were
lying full length on the upper bunks. They did not tire of worrying
me neither did I tire of gently replying to them. This at last
mollified them. Some of them asked me my name and, when I gave it
they felt ashamed. They apologized and made room for me.</p>

In that way I somehow reached Delhi and thence<font size="1">T11

Champaran is the land of King Janaka. Just as it abounds in mango
groves, so used it to be full of indigo plantations until the year
1917. The Champaran tenant was bound by law to plant three out of
every twenty parts of his land with indigo for his  landlord.  This
system was known as the <i>tinkathia </i>system, as three <i>kathas
</i>out of twenty (which make one acre) had to be planted with
indigo.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I must confess that I did not then know even the name, much less the
geographical position, of Champaran, and I had hardly any notion of
indigo plantations. I had seen packets of indigo, but little dreamed
that it was grown and manufactured in Champaran at great hardship to
thousands of agriculturists.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Rajkumar Shukla was one of the agriculturists who had been under this
harrow, and he was filled with a passion to wash away the stain of
indigo for the thousands who were suffering as he had suffered.</p>

This man caught hold of me at Lucknow, where I had gone for the
Congress of 1916. ‘Vakil Babu will tell you everything about our
distress,’ he said, and urged me to go to Champaran. ‘Vakil Babu’
was none other than Babu Brajkishore Prasad, who became my esteemed
co-worker in Champaran, and who is the soul of public work in Bihar.
Rajkumar Shukla brought him to my tent. He was dressed in  a black
alpaca <i>achkan </i>and trousers. Brajkishore Babu failed then to</p>

make an impression on me. I took it that he must be some <i>vakil
</i>exloiting the simple agriculturists. Having heard from him
something of Champaran, I replied as was my wont : ‘I can give no
opinion without seeing the conditions with my own eyes. You will
please move the resolution in the Congress, but leave me free for the
present.’ Rajkumar Shukla of course wanted some help from the
Congress. Babu Brajkishore Prasad moved the resolution, expressing
sympathy for the people of Champaran, and it was unanimously passed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Rajkumar Shukla was glad, but far from satisfied. He wanted me
personally to visit Champaran and witness the miseries of the ryots
there. I told him that I would include Champaran in the tour which I
had contemplated and give it a day or two. ‘One day will be
enough,’ said he, ‘and you will see things with your own eyes.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
From Lucknow I went to Cawnpore. Rajkumar Shukla followed me there.
‘Champaran is very near here. Please give a day,’  he insisted.
‘Pray excuse me this time. But I promise that I will come,’ said
I, further committing myself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I returned to the Ashram. The ubiquitous Rajkumar was there too.
‘Pray fix the day now’, he said. ‘Well’ said I, ‘I have to
be in Calcutta on such and such a date, come and meet me then, and
take me from there.’ I did not know where I was to go, what to do,
what things to see.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Before I reached Bhupen Babu’s place in Calcutta, Rajkumar Shukla
had gone and established himself there. Thus this ignorant,
unsophisticated but resolute agriculturist captured me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So early in 1917, we left Calcutta for Champaran, looking just like
fellow-rustics. I did not even know the train. He took me to it, and
we travelled together, reaching Patna in the morning.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This was my first visit to Patna. I had no friend or acquaintance
with whom I could think of putting up. I had an idea that Rajkumar
Shukla, simple agriculturist as he was, must have some influence in
Patna. I had come to know him a little more on the journey, and on
reaching Patna I had no illusions left concerning him. He  was 
perfectly innocent of everything. The <i>vakils </i>that he had taken
to be his friends were really nothing of the sort. Poor Rajkumar was
more or less as a menial to them. Between such agriculturist clients
and their <i>vakils</i><i> </i>there is a gulf as wide as the Ganges
in flood.</p>

Rajkumar Shukla took me to Rajendra Babu’s place in Patna. Rajendra

There was strict untouchability in Bihar. I might not draw water at
the well whilst the servants were using it, lest drops of water from
my bucket might pollute them, the servants not knowing to what caste
I belonged. Rajkumar directed me to the indoor latrine, the servant
promptly directed me to the outdoor one. All this was far from
surprising or irritating to me, for I was inured to such things. The
servants were doing the duty, which they thought  Rajendra  Babu
would wish them to do.</p>

I knew Maulana Mazharul Haq in London when he was studying for the
bar, and when I met him at the Bombay Congress in 1915—the year in
which he was President of the Muslim League—he had renewed the
acquaintance, and extended me an invitation to stay with him whenever
I happened to go to Patna. I bethought myself of this invitation and
sent him a note indicating the purpose of my visit. He immediately
came in his car, and pressed me to accept his hospitality. I thanked
him and requested him to guide me to my destination by the first
available train, the railway guide being useless to an uttar stranger
like me. He had a talk with Rajkumar Shukla and suggested that I
should first go to Muzaffarpur. There was a train for that place the
same evening, and he sent me off by it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Principal Kripalani was then in Muzaffarpur. I had known of him ever
since my visit to Hyderabad. Dr. Choithram had told me of his great
sacrifice, of his simple life, and of the Ashram that Dr. Choithram
was running out of funds provided by Prof. Kripalani. He used to be a
professor in the Government College, Muzaffarpur, and had just
resigned the post when I went there. I had sent a telegram informing
him of my arrival, and he met me at the station with a crowd of
students, though the train reached there at midnight. He had no rooms
of his own, and was staying with Professor Malkani who therefore
virtually became my host. It was an extraordinary thing in those days
for a Government professor to harbour a man like me.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In the morning a small group of <i>vakils </i>called on me. I still
remember Ramnavmi Prasad among them, as his earnestness specially
appealed to me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is not possible,’ he said, ‘for you to do the kind of work
you have come for, if you stay here (meaning Prof. Malkani’s
quarters). You must come and stay with one of us. Gaya Babu is a
well-known <i>vakil </i>here. I have come on his behalf to invite you
to stay with him. I confess we are all afraid of Government, but we
shall render what help we can. Most of the things Rajkumar Shukla has
told you are true. It is a pity our leaders are not here today. I
have, however, wired to them both, Babu Brajkishore Prasad and Babu
Rajendra Prasad. I expect them to arrive shortly, and they are sure
to be able to give you all the information you want and to help you
considerably. Pray come over to Gaya Babu’s place.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
This was a request that I could not resist, though I hesitated for
fear of embarrassing Gaya Babu. But he put me at ease, and so I went
over to stary with him. He and his people showered all their
affection on me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Brajkishorebabu now arrived from Darbhanga and Rajendra Babu from
Puri. Brajkishorebabu was not the Babu Brajkishore Prasad  I had met
in Lucknow. He impressed me this time with his humility, simplicity,
goodness and extraordinary faith, so characteristic of the Biharis,
and my heart was joyous over it. The Bihar <i>vakils</i>’ regard
for him was an agreeable surprise to me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Soon I felt myself becoming bound to this circle of friends in
lifelong friendship. Brajkishorebabu acquainted me with the facts of
the case. He used to be in the habit of taking up the cases of the
poor tenants. There were two such cases pending when I went there.
When he won any such case,<font size="1">T1 </font>he consoled himself
that he was doing something for these poor people.<font size="1">T2 </font>Not
that he did not charge fees from these simple peasants.<font size="1">T3
</font>Lawyers labour under the belief that, if they do not charge
fees, they will have no wherewithal to run their households, and will
not be able to render effective help to the poor people. The figures
of the fees they charged and the<font size="1">T4 </font>standard of a
barrister’s fees in Bengal and Bihar staggered me.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 0.43cm">
‘We gave Rs. 10,000 to so and so for his opinion,’ I was told.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.43cm">
Nothing less than four figures in any case.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The friends listened to my kindly reproach and did not mis-
understand me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
‘Having studied these cases,’ said I, ‘I have come to the
conclusion that we should stop going to law-courts. Taking such cases
to the courts does little good. Where the ryots are so crushed and
fear- stricken, law-courts are useless. The real relief for them is
to be free from fear. We cannot sit still until we have driven
<i>tinkathia </i>out of Bihar. I had thought that I should be able to
leave here in two days, but I now realize that the work might take
even two years. I am prepared to give that time, if necessary. I am
now feeling my ground, but I want your help.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
I found Brajkishore Babu exceptionally cool-headed. ‘We shall
render all the help we can,’ he said quietly, ‘but pray tell us
what kind of help you will need.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.44cm">
And thus we sat talking until midnight.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I shall have little use for your legal knowledge<font size="1">T5</font>,’
I said to them. ‘I want clerical assistance and help in
interpretation. It may<font size="1">T6 </font>be necessary to face
imprisonment, but much as I would love you to run that risk, you
would go only so far as you feel yourselves capable of going. Even
turning yourselves into clerks and giving up your profession for an
indefinite period is no small thing. I find it difficult to
understand the local dialect of Hindi, and I shall not be able to
read papers written in Kaithi or Urdu. I shall want you to translate
them for me. We cannot afford to pay for this work. I should all be
done for love and out of a spirit of service.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Brajkishorebabu understood this immediately, and he now
cross-examined me and his companions by turns. He tried to ascertain
the implications of all that I had said—how long thier service
would be requi-red, how many of them would be needed, whether they
might serve by turns and so on. Then he asked the <i>vakils </i>the
capacity of their sacrifice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Ultimately they gave me this assurance. ‘Such and such a  number of
us will do whatever you may ask. Some of us will be with you for so
much time as you may require. The idea  of  accommodating oneself to
imprisonment is a novel thing for us. We will try to assimilate it.’</p>

My object was to inquire into the condition of the Champaran
agriculturists and understand their grievances against the indigo
planters. For this purpose it was necessary that I should  meet
thousands of the ryots. But I deemed it essential, before starting on
my inquiry, to know the planters’ side of the case and see the
Commissioner of the Division. I sought and was granted appointments</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
with both.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Secretary of the Planters’ Association told me plainly that I
was an outsider and that I had no business to come between the
planters and their tenants, but if I had any representation to make,
I might submit it in writing. I politely told him that I did not
regard myself as an outsider, and that I had every right to inquire
into the condition of the tenants if they desired me to do so.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The Commissioner, on whom I called, proceeded to bully me, and
advised me forthwith to leave Tirhut.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I acquainted my co-workers with all this, and told them that there
was a likelihood of Government stopping me from proceeding further,
and that I might have to go to jail earlier than I had expected, and
that, if I was to be arrested, it would be best that the arrest
should take place in Motihari or if possible in Bettiah. It was
advisable, therefore, that I should go to those places as early as
possible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Champaran is a district of the Tirhut division and Motihari is its
headquarters. Rajkumar Shukla’s place was in the vicinity of
Bettiah, and the tenants belonging to the <i>kothis </i>in its
neighbourhood were the poorest in the district. Rajkumar Shukla
wanted me to see them and I was equally anxious to do so.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So I started with my co-workers for Motihari the same day. Babu
Gorakh Prasad harboured us in his home, which became a ca-
ravanserai. It could hardly contain us all. The very same  day  we
heard that about five miles from Motihari a tenant had been  ill- 
treated. It was decided that, in company with Babu Dharanidhar
Prasad, I should go and see him the next morning, and we accordingly
set off for the place on elephant’s back. An elephant, by the way,
is about as common in Champaran as a bullock-cart in Gujarat. We had
scarcely gone half way when a messenger from the Police Super-
intendent overtook us and said that the latter had sent his complim-
ents. I saw what he meant. Having left Dharanidhar Babu to proceed to
the original destination, I got into the hired carriage which the
messenger had brought. He then served on me a notice to leave
Champaran, and drove me to my place. On his asking me to acknowledge
the service of the notice, I wrote to the effect that I did not
propose to comply with it and leave Champaran till my inquiry was
finished. Thereupon I received a summons to take my trial the next
day for disobeying the order to leave Champaran.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.49cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I kept awake that whole night writing letters and  giving  necessary
instructions to Babu Brajkishore Prasad.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.01cm">

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
The news of the notice and the summons spread like wildfire, and I
was told that Motihari that day witnessed unprecedented scenes.
Gorakhbabu’s house and the court house overflowed with men.
Fortunately I had finished all my work during the night and so was
able to cope with the crowds. My companions proved the greatest help.
They occupied themselves with regulation the crowds, for the latter
followed me wherever I went<font size="1">T2</font>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A sort of friendliness sprang up between  the  officials—
Collector, Magisrate, Police Superintendent—and myself. I might
have legally resisted the notices served on me. Instead I accepted
them all, and my conduct towards the officials was correct. They thus
saw that I did not want to offend them personally, but that I wanted
to offer civil resistance to their orders. In this way they were put
at ease, and instead of harassing me they gladly availed themselves
of my and my co- worker’s co-operation in regulating the crowds.
But it was an ocular demonstration to them of the fact that their
authority was shaken<font size="1">T3</font>. The people had for the
moment lost all fear of punishment and  yielded obedience to the
power of love which their new friend exercised. It should be
remembered that no one knew me in Champaran. The peasants were all
ignorant. Champaran, being far up north of the Ganges, and right at
the foot of the Himalayas in close proximity to Nepal, was cut off
from the rest of India. The Congress was practically unknown in those
parts. Even those who had heard the name of the Congress shrank from
joining it or even mentioning it. And now the Congress and its
members had entered this land, though not in the name of the
Congress, yet in a far more real sense.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In consultation with my co-workers I had decided that nothing should
be done in the name of the Congress. What we wanted was work and not
name, substance and not shadow. For the name of the Congress was the
<i>bete noire </i>of the Government and their controllers— the
planters. To them the Congress was a byword for lawyers’ wrangles,
evasion of law through legal loopholes, a byword for bomb and
anarchical crime and for diplomacy and hypocrisy. We had to
disillusion them both. Therefore we had decided not to mention the
name of the Congress and not to aqcuaint the peasants with the
organization called the Congress. It was enough, we thought, if they
understood and followed the spirit of the Congress instead of its
letter.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
No emissaries had therefore been sent there, openly or secretly, on
behalf of the Congress to prepare the ground for our arrival.
Rajkumar Shukla was incapable of reaching the thousands of peasants.
No political work had yet been done amongst them. The world outside
Champaran was not known to them. And yet they received me as though
we had been age-long friends. It is<font size="1">T4</font><font size="1">
</font>no exag-</p>

geration, but the literal truth, to say that in this meeting with the
peasants I was face to face with God, Ahimsa and Truth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
When I come to examine my title to this realization, I find nothing
but my love for the people. And this in turn is nothing but an
expression of my unshakable faith in ahimsa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
That day in Champaran was an unforgettable event in my life and a
red-letter day for the peasants and for me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
According to the law, I was to be on my trial, but truly speaking
Government was to be on its trial. The Commissioner only succeeded in
trapping Government in the net which he had spread for me.</p>

Before I could appear before the Court to receive the sentence, the
Magistrate sent a written message that the Lieutenant Governor had
ordered the case against me to be withdrawn, and the Collector wrote
to me saying that I was at liberty to conduct the proposed inquiry,
and that I might count on whatever help I needed from the officials.
None of us was prepared for this prompt and happy issue.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I called on the Collector Mr. Heycock. He seemed to be a good man,
anxious to do justice. He told me that I might ask for whatever
papers I desired to see, and that I was at liberty to see him
whenever I liked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The country thus had its first direct object-lesson in<font size="1">T1
</font>Civil Disobedience. The affair was freely discussed both
locally and in the Press, and<font size="1">T2 </font>my inquiry got
unexpected publicity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was necessary for my inquiry that the Government should remain
neutral. But the inquiry did not need support from Press reporters or
leading articles in the Press. Indeed the situation in Champaran was
so delicate and difficult that over-energetic criti- cism or highly
coloured reports might easily damage the cause which I was seeking to
espouse. So I wrote to the editors of the principal papers requesting
them not to trouble to send any reporters, as I should send them
whatever might be necessary for publication and keep them informed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I knew that the Government attitude countenancing my presence had
displeased the Champaran planters<font size="1">T3 </font>and I knew
that even the officials, though they could say nothing openly, could
hardly have liked it. Incorrect or misleading reports, therefore,
were likely to incense them all the more, and their ire, instead of
descending on me, would be sure to descend on the poor fear-stricken
ryots and seriously hinder my search for the truth about the case.</p>

In spite of these precautions the planters engineered against me a
poisonous agitation. All sorts of falsehoods appeared in the Press
about my co-workers and myself. But my extreme cautiousness and my
insistence on truth, even to the minutest detail, truned the edge of
their sword.<font size="1">T4</font></p>

In such delicate situations as this I did not think it proper to<font size="1">T5
</font>invite any leaders from other provinces. Pandit Malaviyaji had
sent me an assurance that, whenever I wanted him, I had only to send
him word, but I did not trouble him. I thus prevented the stuggle
from assuming a political aspect. But I sent to the leaders and the
principal papers occasional reports, not for publication, but merely
for their information. I had seen<font size="1">T6 </font>that, even
where the end might be political, but where the cause was
non-political, one damaged it by giving it a political aspect and
helped it by keeping it within its non-political limit. The Champaran
struggle was a proof of the fact that disinterested service of the
people in any sphere ultimately helps the country politically</p>

To give a full account of the Champaran inquiry would be to narrate
the history, for the period,<font size="1">T1 </font>of the Champaran
ryot, which is out of the question in these chapters. The Champaran
inquiry was a bold experiment with Truth and Ahimsa, and I am giving
week by week only what occurs to me as worth giving from that point
of view. For more details the reader must turn to Sjt. Rajendra
Prasad’s history of the Champaran Satyagraha in Hindi, of which, I
am told, an English edition<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But to return to the subject matter of this chapter. The inquiry
could not be conducted in Gorakhbabu’s house, without practically
asking poor Gorakhbabu to vacate it. And the people of Motihari had
not yet shed their fear to the extent of renting a house to us.
However, Brajkishorebabu tactfully secured one with considerable open
space about it, and we now removed there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was not quite possible to carry on the work without money. It had
not been the practice hitherto to appeal to the public for money for
work of this kind. Brajkishorebabu and his friends were mainly <i>vakils
</i>who either contributed funds themselves, or found it from friends
whenever there was an occasion. How could they ask the</p>

people to pay when they and their kind could well afford to do so ?
That seemed to be the argument. I had made up my mind not to accept
anything from the Champaran ryots. It would be bound to be
misinterpreted. I was equally determined not to appeal to the country
at large for funds to conduct this inquiry. For that was likely to
give it an all-India and political aspect. Friends from Bombay
offered<font size="1">T3 </font>Rs. 15,000, but I declined the offer
with thanks. I decided to get as much as was possible, with
Brajkishorebabu’s help, from well-to-do Biharis living outside
Champaran and, if more was needed, to approach my friend Dr. P. J.
Mehta of Rangoon. Dr. Mehta readily agreed to send me whatever might
be needed. We were thus free from all anxiety on this score. We were
not likely to require large funds, as we were bent on exercising the
greatest economy in consonance with the poverty of Champaran. Indeed
it was found in the end that we did not need any large amount. I have
an impression that we expended in all not more than three thousand
rupees, and, as far as I remember, we saved a few hundred<font size="1">T4
</font>rupees from what we had collected.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The curious ways of living of my companions in the early days were a
constant theme of raillery at their expense. Each of the <i>vakils
</i>had a servant and a cook, and therefore a separate kitchen, and
they often had their dinner as late as midnight. Though they paid
their own expenses, their irregularity worried me but as we had
become close friends there was no possiblity of a misunder- standing
between us, and they received my ridicule in good part. Ultimately it
was agreed that the servants should be dispensed with, that all the
kitchens should be amalgamated and that regular hours should be
observed. As all were not vegetarians, and as two kitchens would have
been expensive, a common vegetarian kitchen was decided upon. It was
also felt necessary to insist on simple meals.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
These arrangements considerably reduced the expenses and saved us a
lot of time and energy, and both these were badly needed. Crowds of
peasants came to make their statements, and they were followed by an
army of companions who filled the compound and garden to overflowing.
The efforts of my companions to save me from <i>darshan</i>-seekers
were often of no avail, and I had  to  be exhibited for <i>darshan </i>at
particular hours. At least five to seven volun- teers were required
to take down statements, and even then  some people had to go away in
the evening without being able to make their statements. All these
statements were not essential, many  of them being repetitions, but
the poeple could not be satisfied otherwise, and I appreciated their
feeling in the matter.<font size="1">T5</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Those who took down the statements had to observe certain rules. Each
peasant had to be closely cross-examined, and whoever</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
failed to satisfy the test was rejected.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T6</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>This entailed a lot of extra time but most of the
statements were thus rendered incontrovertible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
An officer from the C.I.D. would always be present when these
statements were recorded. We might have prevented him but we had
decided from the very beginning not only not to mind the presence of</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
C.I.D. officers, but to treat them with courtesy and to give them all
the information that it was possible to give them.<font size="1">T7</font><font size="1">
</font>This was far from doing us any harm. On the contrary the very
fact that the statements were taken down in the presence of the
C.I.D. officers made the peasants more fearless. Whilst on the one
hand excessive fear of the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 95%">
C.I.D. was driven out of the peasants’s minds, on the other, their
presence exercised a natural restraint on exaggeration. It was the
business of C.I.D. friends to entrap people and so the peasants had
necessarily to be cautious.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
As I did not want to irritate the planters, but to win them over by
gentleness, I made a point of writing to and meeting such of them
against whom allegations of a serious nature were made. I met the
Planters’ Association as well, placed the ryots’ grievances
before them and acquainted myself with their point of view. Some of
the planters hated me. Some were indifferent and a few treated me
with courtesy.</p>

Brajkishorebabu and Rajendrababu were a matchless pair. Their
devotion made it impossible for me to take a single step without
their help. Their disciples, or their companions—Shambhubabu,
Anugraha- babu, Dharanibabu, Ramnavmibabu and other <i>vakils</i>—were
always with us. Vindhyababu and Janakdharibabu also came and helped
us now and then. All these were Biharis. Their principal work was to
take down the ryot’s statements.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Professor Kripalani could not but cast in his lot with us. Though a
Sindhi he was more Bihari than a born Bihari. I have seen only a few
workers capable of merging themselves in the province of their
adoption. Kripalani is one of those few. He made it impossible for
anyone to feel that he belonged to a different province. He was my
gatekeeper in chief. For the time being he made it the end and aim of
his life to save me from <i>darshan</i>-seekers. He warded off 
people, calling to his aid now his unfailing humour, now his
non-violent threats. At nightfall he would take up his occupation of
a teacher and regale his companions with his historical studies and
observations, and quicken any timid visitor into bravery.</p>

Maulana Mazharul Haq had registered his name on the standing list of

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
splendour in which he then lived was in sharp contrast to his simple
life of today. The way in which he associated with us made us feel
that he was one of us, though his fashionable habit gave a stranger a
diferent impression.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As I gained more experience of Bihar, I became convinced that work of
a permanent nature was impossible without proper village education.
The ryots’ ignorance was pathetic. They either allowed their
children to roam about, or made them toil on indigo plantations from
morning to night for a couple of coppers a day. In those days a male
labourer’s wage did not exceed ten pice, a female’s did not
exceed six, and a child’s three. He who succeeded in earning four
annas a day was considered most fortunate.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In consultation with my companions I decided to open primary schools
in six villages. One of our conditions with the villagers was that
they should provide the teachers with board and lodging while we
would see to the other expenses. The village folk had hardly any cash
in their hands, but they could well afford to  provide foodstuffs.
Indeed they had already expressed their readiness to contrbiute grain
and other raw materials.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
From where to get the teachers was a great problem. It was difficult
to find local teachers who would work for a bare allowance or without
remuneration. My idea was never to entrust children to com- monplace
teachers. Their literary qualification was not so essential as their
moral fibre.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
So I issued a public appeal for voluntary teachers. It received ready
response. Sjt. Gangadharrao Deshpande sent Babsaheb Soman and
Pundalik, Shrimati Avantikabai Gokhale came from Bombay and Mrs.
Anandibai Vaishampayan from Poona.<font size="1">T1 </font>I sent to
the Ashram for Chhotalal, Surendranath and my son Devdas. About  this
 time Mahadev Desai and Narahari Parikh with their wives cast in
their lot with me. Kasturbai was also summoned for the work. This was
a fairly strong contingent. Shrimati Avantikabai and Shrimati
Anandibai were educated enough, but Shrimati Durga Desai and Shrimati
Manibehn Parikh had nothing more than a bare knowledge of Gujarati,
and Kasturbai not even that. How were these ladies to instruct the
children in Hindi ?</p>

I explained to them that they were expected to teach  the  children
not grammar and the three R’s so much as cleanliness and good
manners. I further explained that even as regards letters there was
not so great a difference between Gujarati, Hindi and Marathi as they
imagined, and in the primary classes, at any rate, the teaching of
the rudiments of the alphabet and numerals was not a difficult
matter.</p>

The result was that the classes taken by these ladies were found to
be most successful. The experience inspired them with confidence and
interest in their work. Avantikabai’s became a model shcool. She
threw herself heart and soul into her work. She brought her excep-
tional gifts to bear on it. Through these ladies we could, to some
extent, reach<font size="1">T2 </font>the village women.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">But
I did not want to stop at providing for primary education. The
villages were insanitary, the lanes full of filth, the well
surrounded by mud and stink and the courtyards unbearably untidy. The
elder people badly needed education in cleanliness. They were all
suffering from various skin diseases. So it was decided to do as much
sanitary work as possbile and to penetrate every department of their
lives.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Doctors were needed for this work. I requested the Servants of India
Society to lend us the services of the late Dr. Dev.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>We had been great friends, and he readily offered his
services for six months. The teachers—men and women—had all to
work under him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; line-height: 102%">All
of them had express instructions not to concern themselves with
grievances against planters or with politics. People who had any
complaints to make were to be referred to me. No one was to venture
out of his beat. The friends carried out these instructions with
wonderful fidelity. I do not remember a single  occasion  of
indiscipline.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
As far as was possible we placed each school in charge of one man and
one woman. These volunteers had to look after medical relief and
sanitation. The womenfolk had to be approached through women.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Medical
relief was a very simple affair. Castor oil, quinine and sulphur
ointment were the only durgs provided to the volunteers. If the
patient showed a furred tongue or complained of constipation, castor
oil as administered, in case of fever quinine was given after an
opening dose of castor oil, and the sulphur ointment was applied in
case of boils and itch after thoroughly washing the affected parts.
No patient was permitted to take home any medicine. Wherever there
was some complication Dr. Dev was consulted.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Dr. Dev used to visit each centre on certain fixed days

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Quite a number of people availed themselves of this simple  relief.

is remembered that the prevailing ailments were few and amenable to

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sanitation was a difficult affiar. The people were not prepared to do
anything themselves. Even the field labourers were not ready to do
their own scavenging. But Dr. Dev was not a man easily to lose heart.
He and the volunteers concentrated their energies on making a village
ideally clean. They swept the roads and the courtyards, cleaned out
the wells, filled up the pools nearby, and lovingly persuaded the
villagers to raise volunteers from amongst themselves. In some
villages they shamed people into taking up the work, and in others
the people were so enthusiastic that they even prepared roads to
enable my car to go from place to place. These sweet experiences were
not unmixed with bitter ones of people’s apathy. I remember some
villagers  frankly expressing their dislike for this work.<font size="1">T3</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
It may not be out of place here to narrate an experience that I have
described before now at many meetings.<font size="1">T4 </font>Bhitiharva
was a small village in which was one of our schools.<font size="1">T5 </font>I
happened to visit a smaller village in its vicinity and found some of
the women dressed very dirtily. So I told my wife to ask them why
they did not wash their clothes. She spoke to them. One of the women
took her into her hut and said: ‘Look now, there is no box or
cupboard here containing other clothes. The sari I am wearing is the
only one I have. How am I to wash it ? Tell Mahatmaji to get me
another sari, and I shall then promise to bathe and put on clean
clothes every day.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
This cottage was not an exception, but a type to be found in many
Indian villages. In countless cottages in India people  live without
any furniture, and without a change of clothes, merely with a rag to
cover their shame.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One more experience I will note. In Champaran there is no lack of
bamboo and grass. The school hut they had put up at Bhitiharva was
made of these materials. Someone—possible some of the neigh-
bouring planters’ men—set fire to it one night. It was not
thought advisable to build another hut of bamboo and grass. The
school was in charge of Sjt. Soman and Kasturbai. Sjt. Soman decided
to build a pukka house, and thanks to his infectious labour, many
co-operated with him, and a brick-house was soon made ready. There
was no fear now of this building being burnt down.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus the volunteers with their schools, sanitation work and medical
relief gained the confidence and respect of the village folk, and
were able to bring good influence to bear upon them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
But I must confess with regret that my hope of putting this cons-
tructive work on a permanent footing was not fulfilled. The
volunteers had come for temporary periods, I could not secure any
more from</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
outside, and permanent honorary workers from Bihar were not avail-
able. As soon as my work in Champaran was finished, work outside,
which had been preparing in the meantime, drew me away. The few
month’s work in Champaran, however, took such deep root that its
influence in one form or another is to be observed there even today.</p>

Whilst on the one hand social service work of the kind I have
described in the foregoing chapters was being carried out, on the
other the work of recording statements of the ryots’ grievances was
progressing apace. Thousands of such statements were taken, and they
could not but have their effect. The ever-growing number of ryots
coming to make their statements increased the planters’ wrath, and
they moved heaven and earth to counteract<font size="1">T2 </font>my
inquiry.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
One day I received a letter from the Bihar Government to the
following effect : ‘Your inquiry has been sufficiently prolonged;
should you not now bring it to an end and leave Bihar ?’ The letter
was couched in polite language, but its meaning as obvious.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I wrote in reply that the inquiry was bound to be prolonged, and
unless and until it resulted in bringing relief to the people, I had
no inten-tion of leaving Bihar. I pointed out that it was open to
Gove- rnment to terminate my inquiry by accepting the ryots’
grievances as genuine and redressing them, or by recognizing that the
ryots had made out a <i>prima facie </i>case for an official inquiry
which should be immediately instituted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; line-height: 95%">Sir
Edward Gait, the Lieutenant Governor, asked me to see him,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>expressed his willingness to appoint an inquiry and
invited me to be a member of the Committee. I ascertained the names
of the other members, and after consultation with my co-workers
agreed to serve on the Committee, on condition that I should be free
to confer with my co-workers during the progress of the inquiry, that
Government should recognize that, by being a member of the Committee,
I did not cease to be the ryots’ advocate, and that in case the
result of the inquiry failed to give me satisfaction, I should be
free to guide and advise the ryots as to what line of action they
should take.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Sir Edward Gait accepted the condition as just and proper and

Sir Edward Gait had a large share in getting the Committee to make a
unanimous report and in getting and Agrarian Bill passed in
accordance with the Committee’s recommendations. Had he not adopted
a firm attitude, and had he not brought all his tact to bear on the
subject, the report would not have been unanimous, and the Agrarian
Act would not have been passed. The planters wielded extraordinary
power. They<font size="1">T3 </font>offered strenuous opposition to the
Bill in spite of the report, but Sir Edward Gait remained firm up to
the last and fully carried out the recommendations of the Committee.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The <i>tinkathia </i>system, which had been in existence for about a
century, was thus abolished, and with it the planters’ raj came to
an end. The ryots, who had all along remained crushed, now somewhat
came to their own, and the superstition that the stain of indigo
could never be washed out was exploded.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was my desire to continue the constructive work for some years, to
establish more schools and to penetrate the villages more
effectively. The ground had been prepared, but it did not please God,
as often before, to allow my plans to be fulfilled. Fate decided
otherwise and drove me to take up work elsewhere.</p>

Whilst I was yet winding up my work on the Committee, I received a
letter from Sjts. Mohanlal Pandya and Shankarlal Parikh telling me of
the failure of crops in the Kheda district, and asking me to guide
the peasants, who were unable to pay the assessment. I had not the
inclination, the ability of the courage to advise without an inquiry
on the spot.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At the same time there came a letter from Shrimati Anasuyabai about
the condition of labour in Ahmedabad. Wages were low, the labourers
had long been agitating for an increment, and I had a desire to guide
them if I could. But I had not the confidence<font size="1">T1 </font>to
direct even this comparatively small affair from that long distance.
So I seized the first opportunity to go to Ahmedabad. I had hoped
that I should be able to finish both these matters quickly and get
back to Champaran to supervise the constructive work that had been
inaugurated there.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But things did not move as swiftly as I had wished, and I was unable
to return to Champaran<font size="1">T2</font>, with the result that
the  schools  closed down one by one. My co-workers and I had built
many castles in the air, but they all vanished for the time being.</p>

One of these was cow-protection work in Champaran, bsides rural
sanitation and education. I had seen, in the course of my tra- vels,
that cow-protection and Hindi propaganda had become the exclusive
concern of the Marwadis. A Marwadi friend had sheltered me in his
dharmsala whilst at Bettiah. Other Marwadis of the place had
interested me in their goshala (dairy). My ideas about cow-protection
had been definitely formed then, and my conception of the work, was
the same as it is today. Cow-protection, in my opinion, included
cattle- breeding, improvement of the stock, humane treatment of
bullocks, formation of model dairies, etc. The Marwadi friends had
promised full co-operation in this work, but as I could not fix
myself up in Champaran, the scheme could not be carried out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The goshala in Bettiah is still there, but it has not become a model
dairy, the Champaran bullock is still made to work beyond his
capacity, and the so-called Hindu still cruelly belabours the poor
animal and disgraces his religion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
That this work should have remained unrealized has been, to me, a
continual regret, and whenever I go to Champaran and hear the gentle
reproaches of the Marwadi and Bihari friends, I recall with a heavy
sigh all those plans which I had to drop so abruptly.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
The educational work in one way or another is going on in many
places. But the cow-protection work had not taken firm root, and has
not, therefore, progressed in the direction intended.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.47cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Whilst the Kheda peasants’ question was still being discussed, I
had already taken up the question of the mill-hands in Ahmedabad.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was in a most delicated situation. The mill-hands’ case was
strong.<font size="1">T3 </font>Shrimati Anasuyabai had to battle
against her own brother, Sjt. Ambalal Sarabhai, who led the fray on
behalf of  the  mill- owners.<font size="1">T4 </font>My relations with
them were friendly, and  that  made fighting with them the more
difficult. I held consultations with them, and requested them to
refer the dispute to arbitration, but they refused to recognize the
principle of arbitration.<font size="1">T5</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">

The strike went on for twenty-one days. During the continuance of the

parents and children……How can we brook the interference of a

Before I proceed to describe the progress of the labour dispute it is
essential to have a peep into the Ashram. All the while I was in
Champaran the Ashram was never out of my mind, and occasionally I
paid it flying visits.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At that time the Ashram was in Kochrab, a small village near
Ahmedabad. Plague broke out in this village, and I saw evident danger
to the safety of the Ashram children. It was impossible to keep
ourselves immune from the effects of the surrounding insanitation,
however scrupulously we might observe the rules of cleanliness within
the Ashram walls. We were not then equal either to getting the
Kochrab people to observe these rules nor to serving the village
otherwise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Our ideal was to have the Ashram at a safe distance both from town
and village, and yet at a manageable distance from either. And we
were determined, some day, to settle on ground of our own.<font size="1">T1</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The plauge, I felt, was sufficient notice to quit Kochrab. Sjt.
Punjabhai Hirachand, a merchant in Ahmedabad,<font size="1">T2 </font>had
come in close contact with the Ashram, and used to serve us in a
number of matters in a pure and selfless spirit. He had a wide
expreience of things in Ahmedabad, and he volunteered to procure us
suitable land<font size="1">T3</font>. I went about with him north
south of Kochrab in search of land, and then suggested to him to find
out a piece of land three or four miles to the</p>

north. He hit upon the present site. Its vicinity to the Sabaramati
Central Jail was for me a special attraction. As jail-going was
understood to be the normal lot of satyagrahis, I liked this
position. And I knew that the sites selected for jails have generally
clean surroundings.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In about eight days the sale was executed. There  was  no building on
the land and no tree. But its situation on the bank of the river and
its solitude were great advantages.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
We decided to start by living under canvas, and having a tin shed for
a kitchen, till permanent houses were built.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The Ashram had been slowly growing. We were now over forty souls,
men, women and children, having our meals at a common kitchen. The
whole conception about the removal was mine, the execution was as
usual left to Maganlal.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Our difficulties, before we had permanent living accom- modation,
were great. The rains were impending, and provisions had to be got
from the city four miles away. The ground, which had been a waste,
was infested with snakes, and it was no small risk to live with
little children under such conditions. The general rule was not to
kill the snakes, though I confess none of us had shed the fear of
these reptiles, nor have we even now.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The rule of not killing venomous reptiles has been practised for the
most part at Phoenix, Tolstoy Farm and Sabarmati. At each of these
places we had to settle on waste lands<font size="1">T4</font>. We have
had, however, no loss of life occasioned by snakebite. I see, with
the eye of faith, in this circumstance the hand of the God of Mercy.
Let no one cavil at this, saying that God can never be partial, and
that He has no time to meddle with the humdrum affairs of men. I have
no other language to express the fact of the matter, to describe this
uniform experience of mine<font size="1">T5</font>. Human language can
but imperfectly describe God’s ways. I am sensible of the fact that
they are indescribable and inscrutable. But if mortal man will dare
to describe them, he has no better medium than his own inarticulate
speech<font size="1">T6</font>. Even if it be a superstition  to
believe that complete immunity from harm for twenty-five years in
spite of a fairly regular practice of non-killing is not a fortuitous
accident but a grace of God, I should still hug that superstition.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
During the strike of the mill-hands in Ahmedabad the foundation of
the Ashram weaving-shed was being laid. For the principal activity of
the Ashram was then weaving. Spinning had not so far been possible
for us.</p>

FAST</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
For the first two weeks the mill-hands exhibited great courage and
self-restraint and daily held monster meetings. On these occa- sions
I used to remind them of their pledge, and they would shout back to
me the assurance that they would rather die than break their word.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
But at last they began to show signs of flagging. Just as physical
weakness in men manifests itself in irascibility, their attitude
towards the blacklegs became more and more menacing as the strike
seemed to weaken, and I began to fear an outbreak of rowdyism on
their part. The attendance at their daily meetings also began to
dwindle by degrees, and despondency and despair were writ large on
the faces of those who did attend. Finally the information was
brought to me that the strikers had begun to totter. I felt deeply
troubled and set to thinking furiously as to what my duty was in the
circumstances. I had had experience of a gigantic strike in South
Africa, but the situation that confronted me here was different. The
mill-hands had taken the pledge at my suggestion. They had repeated
it before me day after day, and the very idea that they might now go
back upon it was to me inconceivable. Was it pride or was it my love
for the labourers and my passionate regard for truth that was at the
back of this feeling—who can say ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
One morning—it was at a mill-hands’ meeting—while I was still
groping and unable to see my way clearly, the light came to me.
Unbidden and all by themselves the words came to my lips: ‘Unless
the strikers rally’, I declared to the meeting, ‘and continue the
strike till a settlement is reached or till they leave the mills
altogether,<font size="1">T1 </font>I will not touch any food.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The labourers<font size="1">T2 </font>were thunderstruck. Tears began 
to  course down Anasuyabehn’s cheeks. The labourers broke out, ‘Not
you but we shall fast. It would be monstrous if you were to fast.
Please forgive us for our lapse, we will now remain faithful to our
pledge to the end.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘There is no need for you to fast,’ I replied. ‘It would  be 
enough if you could remain true to your pledge. As you know we are
without funds, and we do not want to continue our strike by living on
public charity. You should therefore try to eke out a bare existence
by some kind of labour, so that you may be able to remain
unconcerned, no matter how long the strike may continue. As for my
fast, it will be broken only after the strike is settled.’</p>

In the meantime Vallabhbhai was trying to find some employment for
the strikers under the Municipality, but there was not much hope of
success there. Maganlal Gandhi suggested that, as we needed sand for
filling the foundation of our weaving school in the Ashram, a number
of them might be employed for that purpose. The labourers welcomed
the proposal. Anasuyabehn led the way with a basket on her head and
soon an endless stream of labourers carrying baskets of sand on their
heads could be seen issuing out of the hollow of river-bed. It was a
sight worth seeing. The labourers felt themselves infused with a new
strength, and it became difficult to cope with the task of paying out
wages to them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
My fast was not free from a grave defect. For as I have already
mentioned in a previous chapter, I enjoyed very close and cordial
relations with the mill-owners, and my fast could not but affect
their decision. As a satyagrahi I knew that I might not fast against
them, but ought to leave them free to be influenced by the
mill-hands’ strike alone. My fast was undertaken not on account of
lapse of the mill- owners, but on account of that of the labourers in
which, as their representative, I felt I had a share. With the
mill-owners, I could only plead; to fast against them would amount to
coercion. Yet in spite of my knowledge that my fast was bound to put
pressure upon them, as in fact it did, I felt I could not help it.
The duty to undertake it<font size="1">T3 </font>seemed to me to be
clear.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I tried to set the mill-owners at ease. ‘There is not the slightest
necessity for you to withdraw from your position,’ I said to them.
But they received my words coldly and even flung keen, delicate bits
of sarcasm at me, as indeed they had a perfect right to do.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The principal man at the back of the mill-owners’ unbending
attitude towards the strike was Sheth Ambalal. His resolute will and
transparent sincerity were wonderful and captured my heart. It was a
pleasure to be pitched against him. The strain produced by my fast
upon the opposition, of which he was the head, cut me, therefore, to
the quick. And then, Sarladevi, his wife, was attached to me with the
affection of a blood-sister, and I could not bear to see her anguish
on account of my action.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Anasuyabehn and a number of other friends and labourers shared the
fast with me on the first day. But after some difficulty I was able
to dissuade them from continuing it further.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The net result of it was that an atmosphere of goodwill was created
all round. The hearts of the mill-owners were touched, and they set
about discovering some means for a settlement. Anasuya- behn’s
house became the venue of their discussions. Sjt. Anand-</p>

shankar Dhruva intervened and was in the end appointed arbi- trator,
and the strike was called off after I had fasted only for three days.
The mill-owners commemorated the event by distri- buting sweets among
the labourers, and thus a settlement was reached after 21 days’
strike.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
At the meeting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>held to celebrate the settlement, both the mill- owners
and the Commissioner<font size="1">T4 </font>were present. The advice
which the latter gave to the mill-hands on this occasion was: ‘You
should always act as Mr. Gandhi advises you.’ Almost immediately
after these events I had to engage in a tussle with this very
gentleman. But circumstances were changed, and he had changed with
the circumstances. He then set about warning the Patidars of Kheda
against following my advice !</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I must not close this chapter without noting here an incident, as
amusing as it was pathetic. It happened in connection with the
distribution of sweets.<font size="1">T5 </font>The mill-owners had
ordered a very large quantity, and it was a problem how to distribute
it among  the  thousands of labourers. It was decided that it would
be the fittest thing to distribute it in the open, beneath the very
tree under which the pledge had been taken, especially as it would
have been extremely inconvenient to assemble them all together in any
other place.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I<font size="1">T6 </font>had taken it for granted that the men who had
observed strict discipline for full 21 days would without any
difficulty be able to remain standing in an orderly manner while the
sweets were being distributed, and not make an impatient scramble for
them. But when it came to the test, all the methods that were tried
for making the distribution failed. Again and again their ranks would
break into confusion after distribution had proceeded for a couple of
minutes. The leaders of the mill-hands tried their best to restore
order, but in vain. The confusion, the crush and the scramble at last
became so great that quite an amount of the sweets was spoiled by 
being trampled under foot, and the attempt to distribute them in the
open had finally to be given up. With difficulty we succeeded in
taking away the remaining sweets to Sheth Ambalal’s bungalow in
Mirzapur. Sweets were distributed comfortably the next day  within 
the compound of that bungalow.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The comic side of this incident is obvious, but the pathetic side
bears mention. Subsequent inquiry revealed the fact that the beggar
population of Ahmedabad, having got scent of the fact that sweets
were to be distributed under the <i>Ek-Tek </i>tree, had gone there
in large numbers, and it was their hungry scramble for the sweets
that had created all the confusion and disorder.</p>

No breathing time was, however, in store for me. Hardly was the
Ahmedabad mill-hands’ strike over, when I had to plunge into the
Kheda Satyagraha struggle.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A condition approaching famine had arisen in the Kheda district owing
to a widespread failure of crops, and the Patidars of Kheda were
considering the question of getting the revenue assessment for the
year suspended.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Sjt. Amritlal Thakkar had already inquired into and reported on the
situation and personally discussed the question with the
Commissioner, before I gave definite advice to the cultivators.<font size="1">T1
</font>Sjts. Mohanlal Pandya and Shankarlal Parikh had also thrown
themselves into the fight, and had set up an agitation in the Bombay
Legislative Council through Sjt. Vithalbhai Patel and the late Sir
Gokuldas Kahandas Parekh. More than one deputation had waited upon
the Governor in that connection.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was at this time President of the Gujarat Sabha. The Sabha sent
petitions and telegrams to the Government and even patiently
swallowed the insults and threats of the Commissioner. The conduct of
the officials on this occasion was so ridiculous and undignified as
to be almost incredible now.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The cultivators’demand was as clear as daylight, and so moderate as
to make out a strong case for its acceptance. Under the Land Revenue
Rules, if the crop was four annas or under, the culti- vators could
claim full suspension of the revenue assessment for the year.
According to the official figures the crop was said to be over four
annas. The contention of the cultivators, on the other hand, was that
it was less than four annas. But the Government was in no mood to
listen, and regarded the popular demand for arbitration as <i>lese
majeste</i>. At last all petitioning and prayer having failed, after
taking counsel with co-workers, I advised the Patidars to resort to
satyagraha.</p>

‘Knowing that the crops of our villages are less than four annas,
we requested the Government to suspend the collection of revenue
assessment till the ensuing year, but the Government has not acceded
to our prayer. Therefore, we, the undersigned, hereby  solemnly
declare that we shall not, of our own accord, pay to the Government
the full or the remaining revenue for the year. We shall let the
Gove- rnment take whatever legal steps it may think fit and gladly
suffer the consequences of our non-payment. We shall rather let our
lands be forfeited than that by voluntary payment we should allow our
case to be considered false or should compromise our self-respect.
Should the Government, however, agree to suspend collection of the
second instalment of the assessment throughout the district, such
amongst us as are in a position to pay will pay up the whole or the
balance of the revenue that may be due. The reason why those<font size="1">T4
</font>who are able to pay still withhold payment is that, if they
pay up, the poorer ryots may in a panic sell their chattels or incur
debts to pay their dues, and thereby bring suffering upon themselves.
In these circumstances we feel that, for the sake of the poor, it is
the duty even of those who can afford to pay to withhold payment of
thier assessment.’</p>

At the same time the satyagrahi volunteers had to learn the new
lesson of simplicity. I cannot say that they imbibed it fully, but
they considerably changed their ways of life.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
For the Patidar farmers, too,<font size="1">T1 </font>the fight was
quite a new thing. We had, therefore, to go about from village to
village explaining the principles of satyagraha.</p>

The main thing was to rid the agriculturists of their fear by making
them realize that the officials were not the masters but the servants
of the people, inasmuch as they received their salaries from the
taxpayer. And then it seemed well nigh impossible to make them
realize the duty of combining civility with fearlessness. Once they
had shed the fear of the officials, how could they be stopped from
returning their insults? And yet if they resorted to incivility it
would spoil their satyagraha, like a drop of arsenic in milk. I
realized later that they had less fully learnt the lesson of civility
than I  had expected. Experience has taught me that civility is the
most difficult part of satyagraha. Civility does not here mean the
mere outward gentleness of speech cultivated for the occasion, but an
inborn gentl- eness and desire to do the opponent good. These should
show themselves in every act of a satyagrahi.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In the initial stages, though the people exhibited much courage, the
Government did not seem inclined to take strong action. But as the
people’s firmness showed no signs of wavering, the Government began
coercion. The attachment officers sold people’s cattle and seized
whatever movables they could lay hands on. Penalty notices were
served, and in some cases standing crops were attached. This unnerved
the peasants, some of whom paid up their dues, while others desired
to place safe movables in the way of the officials so that they might
attach them to realize the dues. On the other hand some were prepared
to fight to the bitter end.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
While these things were going on, one of Sjt. Shankarlal  Parikh’s
tenants paid up the assessment in respect of his land. This created a
sensation. Sjt. Shankarlal Parikh immediately made amends for his
tenant’s mistake by giving away for charitable purposes the land
for which the assessment had been paid. He  thus  saved  his honour
and set a good example to others.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
With a view to steeling the hearts of those who were frightened, I
advised the people, under the leadership of Sjt. Mohanlal Pandya, to
remove the crop of onion, from a field which had been in my opinion</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
wrongly attached. I did not regard this as civil disobedience, but
even if it was, I suggested that this attachment of standing crops<font size="1">T2</font>,
though it might be in accordance with law, was morally wrong, and was
nothing short of looting, and that therefore it was the people’s
duty to remove the onion in spite of the order of attachment. This
was a good oppor- tunity for the people to learn a lesson in courting
fines or impris- onment, which was the necessary consequence of such
disobedience<font size="1">T3</font>. For Sjt. Mohanlal Pandya it was a
thing after his heart. He did not like the campaign to end without
someone undergoing suffering in the shape of imprisonment for
something done consistenly with the principles of satyagraha. So he
volunteered to remove the onion crop from the field, and in this
seven or eight friends joined him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
It was impossible for the Government to leave them free. The arrest
of Sjt. Mohanlal and his companions added to the people’s
enthusiasm. When the fear of jail disappears, repression puts heart
into the people. Crowds of them besieged the court-house on the day
of the hearing. Pandya and his companions were convicted and sente-
nced to a brief term of imprisonment. I was<font size="1">T4 </font>of
opinion that the conviction was wrong, because the act of removing
the onion crop could not come under the definition of ‘theft’ in
the Penal Code. But no appeal was filed as the policy was to avoid
the law-courts.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A procession escorted the ‘convicts’ to jail, and on that day
Sjt. Mohanlal  Pandya  earned  from  the  people  the   honoured 
title  of   ‘ <i>dungli chor</i>’ (onion thief) which he enjoys
to this day.</p>

The campaign came to an unexpected end. It was clear that the people
were exhausted, and I hesitated to let the unbending be driven to
utter ruin. I was casting about for some graceful way of terminating
the struggle which would be acceptable to a satyagrahi. Such a one
appeared quite unexpectedly. The Mamlatdar of the Nadiad Taluk sent
me word that, if well-to-do Patidars paid up, the poorer ones would
be granted suspension. I asked for a written undertaking to that
effect, which was given. But as a Mamlatdar could be responsible only
for his Taluk, I inquired of the Collector, who alone could give an
undertaking in respect of the whole district, whether the Mamlatdar’s
undertaking was true for the whole district.<font size="1">T1 </font>He
replied that order declaring suspension in terms of the Maml-atdar’s
letter had been already issued. I was not aware of it, but if it was
a fact, the people’s pledge had been fulfilled. The pledge, it will
be remembered, had the same thing for its ojbect, and so we expressed
ourselves satisfied with</p>

<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
the orders.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
However, the end was far from making me<font size="1">T2 </font>feel
happy, inasmuch as it lacked the grace with which the termination of
every satyagraha campaign ought to be accompanied. The Collector
carried on as though he had done nothing by way of a settlement. The
poor were to be granted suspension, but hardly any got the benefit of
it. It was the people’s right to determine who was poor, but they
could not exercise it. I was sad that they had not the strength to
exercise the right. Although, therefore, the termination was
celebrated as a truimph of satyagraha, I could not enthuse over it,
as it lacked the essentials of a complete triumph.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The end of a satyagrapha campaign can be described as worthy, only
when it leaves the satyagrahis stronger and more spirited than they
are in the beginning.<font size="1">T3</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The campaign was not, however, without its indirect  results which we
can see<font size="1">T4 </font>today and the benefit of which we are
reaping. The Kheda Satyagraha marks the beginning of an awakening
among the peasants of Gujarat, the beginning of their true political
education.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Besant’s brilliant Home Rule agitation had certainly touched
the peasants, but it was the Kheda campaign that compelled the
educated public workers to establish contact with the actual life of
the peasants. They learnt to identify themselves with the  latter. 
They found their proper sphere of work, their capacity for sacrifice
incr- eased. That Vallabhbhai found himself during this campaign was
by itself no small achievement. We could realize its measure during
the flood relief operations last year and the Bardoli Satyagraha this
year. Public life in Gujarat became instinct with a new energy and a
new vigour. The Patidar peasant came to an unforgettable
consciousness of his strength. The lesson was indelibly imprinted on
the public mind that the salvation of the people depends upon
themselves, upon their capacity or suffering and sacrifice. Through
the Kheda campaign satyagraha took firm root in the soil of Gujarat.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Although, therefore, I found nothing to enthuse over in the
termination of the satyagraha, the Kheda peasants were jubilant,
because they knew that what they had achieved was commensurate with
their effort, and they had found the true and infalliable method for
a redress of their grievances <font size="1">T5</font>. This knowledge
was enough justification for their jubilation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Nevertheless the Kheda peasants had not fully understood the inner
meaning of satyagraha, and they saw it to their cost, as we shall see
in the chapters to follow.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 95%">
The Kheda campaign was launched while the deadly war in Europe was
still going on. Now a crisis had arrived,<font size="1">T1 </font>and
the Viceroy had invited various leaders to a war conference in Delhi.
I had also been urged to attend the conference. I have already
referred to the cordial relations between Lord Chelmsford, the
Viceroy, and myself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In response to the invitation I went to Delhi. I had, however,
objections to taking part in the conference, the principal one being
the exclusion from it of leaders like the Ali Brothers<font size="1">T2</font>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>They were then in jail. I had met them only once or
twice, though I had heard much about them. Everyone had spoken highly
of their services and their courage. I had not then come in close
touch with Hakim Saheb, but <font size="1">T3</font>Principal Rudra and
Dinabandhu Andrews had told me a deal in his praise. I had met Mr.
Shuaib Qureshi and Mr. Khwaja at the Muslim League in Calcutta. I had
also come in contact with Drs. Ansari and Abdur Rehman. I was seeking
the friendship of good Mussalmans, and was eager to understand the
Mussalman mind through contact with their purest and most patriotic
representatives. I therefore never needed any pressure to go with
them, wherever they took me, in order to get into intimate touch with
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I had realized early enough in South Africa that there was no genuine
friendship between the Hindus and the Mussalmans. I never missed a
single opportunity to remove obstacles in the way of unity. It was
not in my nature to placate anyone by adulation, or at the cost of
self-respect. But my South African experiences had convinced me that
it would be on the questions of Hindu-Muslim unity that my ahimsa
would be put to its severest test, and that the question presented
the widest field for my experiments in ahimsa. The conviction is
still there. Every moment of my life I realize that God is putting me
on my trial.<font size="1">T4</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Having such strong convictions on the question when I returned from
South Africa, I prized the contact with the Brothers.<font size="1">T5
</font>But before closer touch could be established they were
isolated.<font size="1">T6 </font>Maulana Mahomed Ali used to write
long letters to me from Betul and Chhin- dwada whenever his jailers
allowed him to do so. I applied for perm- ission to visit the
Brothers, but to no purpose.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
It was after the imprisonment of the Ali Brothers that I was invited
by Muslim friends to attend the session of the Muslim League at
Calcutta. Being requested to speak, I addressed them on the duty of</p>

the Muslims to secure the Brothers’ release. A little while after
this I was taken by these friends to the Muslim College at Aligarh.
There I invited the young men to be fakirs for the service of the
motherland.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Next I opened correspondence with the Government for the release of
the Brothers. In that connection I studied the Brothers’ views and
activities about the Khilafat. I had discussions with Mussal- man
friends. I felt that, if I would become a true friend of the Musl-
ims, I must render all possible help in securing the release of the
Brothers, and a just settlement of the Khilafat question.<font size="1">T7
</font>It was not for me to enter into the absolute merits of the
question, provided there was nothing immoral in their demands. In
matters of religion beliefs differ, and each one’s is supreme for
himself. If all had the same belief about all matters of religion,
there would be only one religion in the world. As time progressed I
found that the Muslim demand about the Khilafat was not only not
against any ethical principle, but that the British Prime Minister<font size="1">T8
</font>had admitted the  justice  of the Muslim demand. I felt,
therefore, bound to render what help I could in securing a due
fulfilment of the Prime Minister’s pledge. The pledge had been
given in such clear terms that the examination of the Muslim demand
on the merits<font size="1">T9 </font>was needed only to satisfy my own
conscience.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Friends and critics have<font size="1">T10 </font>criticized my
attitude regarding the Khilafat question. In spite of the
criticism<font size="1">T11 </font>I feel that I have no reason to
revise it or to regret my co-operation with the Muslims. I should
adopt the same attitude, should a similar occasion arise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
When, therefore, I went to Delhi, I had fully intended to submit the
Muslim case to the Viceroy. The Khilafat question had not then
assumed the shape it did subsequently.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But on my reaching Delhi another difficulty in the way of my
attending the conference arose. Dinabandhu Andrews  raised  a
question about the morality of my participation in the war
conference. He told me of the<font size="1">T12 </font>controversy in
the British Press regarding secret treaties between England and
Italy. How could I participate in the conference, if England had
entered into secret treaties with another European power ?—asked
Mr. Andrews. I knew nothing of the treaties. Dinabandhu Andrews’s
word was enough for me. I therefore addressed a letter to Lord
Chelmsford explaining my hesit-ation to take part in the conference.
He invited me to discuss the question with him. I had a prolonged
discussion with him and his Private Secretary</p>

Mr. Maffey. As a result I agreed to take part in the conference. This
was in effect the Viceroy’s argument : ‘Surely you do not believe
that the Viceroy knows everything done by the British Cabinet. I do
not claim, no one claims, that the British Government is infallible.
But if you agree that the Empire has been, on the whole, a power for
good, if you believe that India has, on the whole, benefited by the
British connection, would you not admit that it is the duty of every
Indian citizen to help the Empire in the hour of its need ? I can
assure you that I know nothing beyond what the papers say, and you
know the canards that these papers frequently start. Can you, acting
on a mere newspaper report, refuse help to the Empire at such a
critical juncture</p>

? You may raise whatever moral issues you like and challenge us as
much as you please after the conclusion of the war, not today.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The argument was not new. It appealed to me as new because of the
manner in which, and the hour at which, it was presented, and I
agreed to attend the conference. As regards the Muslim demands I was
to address a letter to the Viceroy.</p>

So I attended the conference. The Viceroy was very keen on my
supporting the resolution about recruiting. I asked for permi- ssion
to speak in Hindi-Hindustani. The Viceroy acceded to my request, but
suggested that I should speak also in English. I had no speech to
make. I spoke but one sentence to this effect : ‘With a full sense
of my responsibility I beg to support the reso- lution.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Many congratulated me on my having spoken in Hindustani. That was,
they said, the first instance within living memory of anyone having
spoken in Hindustani at such a meeting. The congratulations and the
discovery that I was the first to speak in Hindustani at a Viceregal
meeting hurt my national pride. I felt like shrinking into myself.
What a tragedy that the language of the country should be taboo in
meetings held in the country, for work relating  to  the country, and
that a speech there in Hindustani by a stray individual like myself
should be a matter for congratulation ? Incidents like these are
reminders of the low state to which we have been reduced.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The one sentence that I uttered at the conference had for me
considerable significance. It was impossible for me to forget either
the conference or the resolution I supported. There was one
underta-king that I had to fulfil while yet in Delhi. I had to write
a letter to the Viceroy. This was no easy thing for me. I felt it my
duty both in the interests of the Government and of the people to
explain therein how</p>

In the letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>I
expressed my regret for the exclusion from the conference of leaders
like Lokamanya Tilak and the Ali Brothers, and stated the people’s
minimum political demand as also the demands of the Muslims on
account of the situation created by the War. I asked for premission
to publish the letter, and the Viceroy gladly gave it. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">.</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The letter had to be sent to Simla, where the Viceroy has gone
immediately after the conference. The letter had for me considerable
importance, and sending it by post would have meant delay. I wanted
to save time, and yet I was not inclined to send it by any messenger
I came across. I wanted some pure man to carry it and hand it 
perosnally at the Viceregal Lodge. Dinabandhu Andrews and Prin- cipal
Rudra suggeted the name of the good Rev. Ireland of the Cambridge
Mission. He agreed to carry the letter if he might read it and if it
appealed to him as good. I had no objection as the letter was by no
means private. He read it, liked it and expressed his willingness to
carry out the mission. I offered him the second-class fare, but he
declined it saying he was accustomed to travelling intermediate. This
he did though it was a night journey. His simplicity and his straight
and plain-spoken manner captivated me. The letter thus delivered at
the hands of a pure-minded man had, as I thought, the desired<font size="1">T1
</font>result. It eased my mind<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
cleared my way.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The other part of my obligation consisted in raising recruits. Where
could I make a beginning except in Kheda ? And whom could I invite to
be the first recruits except my own co-workers ? So as soon as I
reached Nadiad, I had a conference with Vallabhbhai and other
friends. Some of them could not easily take to the proposal. Those
who liked the proposal had misgivings about its success. There was no
love lost between the Government and the classes to which I wanted to
make my appeal. The bitter experience they had of the Government
officials was still fresh in their memory.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And yet they were in favour of starting work. As soon as I set about
my task, my eyes were opened. My optimism received a rude shock.<font size="1">T3
</font>Whereas during the revenue campaign the people readily offered
their carts free of charge, and two<font size="1">T4 </font>volunteers
came forth when one was needed, it was difficult now to get a cart
even on hire, to say nothing of volunteers. But we would not be
dismayed. We decided to dispense with the use of carts and to do our
journeys on foot. At this rate we had to trudge about 20 miles a day.

forthcoming, it was idle to expect people to feed us. It was hardly
proper to ask for food. So it was decided that every volunteer must
carry his food in his satchel. No bedding or sheet was necessary as
it was summer.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
We had meetings wherever we went. People did attend, but  hardly one
or two would offer themselves as recruits. ‘You are votary of
ahimsa, how can you ask us to take up arms ?’ ‘What good has
Government done for India to deserve our co-operation ?’ These and
similar questions used to be put to us.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
However, our steady work began to tell. Quite a number of names were
registered, and we hoped that we should be able to have a regular
supply as soon as the first batch was sent. I had already begun to
confer with the Commissioner as to where the recruits were to be
accommodated.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The Commsioners in every division were holding conferences on the
Delhi model. One such was held in Gujarat. My co-workers and I were
invited to it. We attended, but I felt there was even less place for
me here than at Delhi. In this atmosphere of servile submission I
felt ill at ease. I spoke somewhat at length. I could say<font size="1">T5
</font>nothing to please the officials, and had certainly one or two
hard things to say.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I used to issue leaflets asking people to enlist as recruits.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>One of the arguments I had was distasteful to the
Commissioner : ‘Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in
India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of
arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we
want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the
middle classes render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its
trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will
be withdrawn.’ The Commissioner referred to this and said that he
appreciated my presence in the conference in spite of the differences
between us. And I had to justify my standpoint as courteously as I
could :</p>

recognize that in the hour of its danger we must give, as we have
decided to give, ungrudging and unequivocal support to the Empire of
which we aspire in the near future to be partners in the same sense
as the Dominions overseas. But it is the simple truth that our
response is due to the expectation that our goal will be reached all
the more speedily. On that account, even as performance of duty
automatically confers a corresponding right, people are entitled to
believe that the imminent reforms alluded to in your speech will
embody the main general principles of the Congress-League Scheme, and

Empire at its critical moment, and I know that India, by this very
act, would become the most favoured partner in the Empire, and racial
distinctions would become a thing of the past. But practically the
whole of educated India has decided to take a less effective course,
and it is no longer possible to say that educated India does not
exercise any influence on the masses. I have been coming into most
intimate touch with the ryots ever since my return from South Africa
to India, and I wish to assure you that the desire for Home Rule has
widely penetrated them. I was present at the sessions of the last
Congress, and I was a party to the resolution that full Responsible
Government should be granted to British India within a period to be
fixed definitely by a Parliamentary Statute. I admit that it is a
bold step to take, but I feel sure that nothing less than a definite
vision of Home Rule to be realized in the shortest possible time will
satisfy</font></font></p>

wakeful enough to realize that they must be equally prepared to

our journey to the goal by silently and simply devoting ourselves
heart and soul to the work of delivering the Empire from the
threatening danger. It will be national suicide not to recognize this

differences. If the appeal involves the toleration of tyranny and
wrongdoing on the part of officials, I am powerless to respond. I
shall resist organized tyranny to the uttermost. The appeal must be
to the officials that they do not ill-treat a single soul, and that
they consult and respect popular opinion as never before. In
Champaran by resisting an age-long tyranny I have shown the ultimate
sovereignty of British justice. In Kheda a population that was
cursing the Government now feels that it, and not the Government, is
the power when it is prepared to suffer for the truth it represents.
It is, therefore, losing its bitterness and is saying to itself that
the Government must be a Government for people, for it tolerates
orderly and respectful disobedience where injustice is felt. Thus
Champaran and Kheda affairs are my direct, definite and special
contributon to the War. Ask me to suspend my activities in that
direction and you ask me to suspend my life. If I could popularize
the use of soul-force, which is but another name for love-force, in
place of brute force, I know that I could present you with an India
that could defy the whole world to do its worst. In season and out of
season, therefore, I shall discipline myself to express in my life
this eternal law of suffering, and present it for acceptance to those
who care, and if I take part in any other activity, the motive is to
show the matchless superiority of that law.</font></font></p>

NEAR DEATH’S DOOR</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 95%">
I very nearly ruined my constitution during the recruiting campaign.
In those days my food principally consisted of ground- nut butter and
lemons.<font size="1">T1 </font>I knew that it was possible to eat too
much butter and injure one’s health, and yet I allowed myself to do
so. This gave me a slight attack of dysentery. I did not take serious
notice of this, and went that evening to the Ashram, as was my wont
every now and then. I scarcely took any medicine in those days. I
thought I should get well if I skipped a meal, and indeed I felt
fairly free from trouble as I omitted the morning meal next day. I
knew, however, that to be entirely free I must prolong my fast and,
if I ate anything at all, I should have nothing but fruit juices.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
There was some festival that day, and although<font size="1">T2 </font>I
had told Kasturbai that I should have nothing for my midday meal, she
temp- eted me and I succumbed. As I was under a vow of taking no milk
or milk products, she<font size="1">T3 </font>had specially prepared
for me a sweet wheaten porridge with oil added to it instead of ghee.
She had reserved too a bowlful of <i>mung </i>for me. I was fond of
these things, and I readily took them, hoping that without coming to
grief I should eat just enough to please Kasturbai and to satisfy my
palate. But the devil had been only waiting for an opportunity.
Instead of eating very little I had my fill of the meal. This was
sufficient invitation to the angel of death. Within an hour the
dysentery appeared in acute form.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The same evening I had to go back to Nadiad. I walked with very great
difficulty to the Sabarmati station, a distance of only<font size="1">T4
</font>ten furlongs. Sjt. Vallabhbhai, who joined me at Ahmedabad,
saw that I was unwell, but I did not allow him to guess how
unbearable the pain was.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
We reached Nadiad at about ten o’clock.<font size="1">T5 </font>The
Hindu Ana- thashram where we had our headquarters was only half a
mile<font size="1">T6 </font>from the station; but it was as good as
ten for me. I somehow managed to reach the quarters, but the griping
pain was steadily increasing.<font size="1">T7 </font>Instead of using
the usual latrine which was a long way off, I asked for a commode to
be placed in the adjoining room. I was ashamed to have to ask for
this, but there was no escape. Sjt. Fulchand imm- ediately procured a
commode. All the friends surrounded me deeply</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
concerned. They were all love and attention, but they could not
relieve my pain. And my obstinacy added to their helplessness. I
refused all medical aid. I would take no medicine, but preferred to
suffer the penalty for my folly. So they looked on in helpless
dismay. I must have had thirty to forty motions in twenty-four hours.
I fasted, not taking even fruit juices in the beginning. The appetite
had all gone. I had thought all along that I had an iron frame, but I
found that my body had now become a lump of clay. It had lost a power
of resis- tance. Dr. Kanuga came and pleaded with me to take
medicine. I declined. He offered to give me an injection. I declined
that too. My ignorance about injections was in those days quite
ridiculous. I believed that an injection must be some kind of serum.
Later I disco- vered that the injection that the doctor suggested was
a vegetable substance, but the discovery was too late to be of use.
The motions still continued, leaving me completely exhausted. The
exhaustion brought on a delirious fever. The friends got more
nervous, and called in more doctors. But what could they do with a
patient who would not listen to them ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Sheth Ambalal with his good wife came down to Nadiad, conferred with
my co-workers and removed me with the greatest care to his Mirzapur
bungalow in Ahmedabad. It was impossible for anyone to receive more
loving and selfess service than I had the priv- ilege of having
during this illness. But a sort of low fever persisted, wearing away
my body from day to day. I felt that the illness was bound to be
prolonged and posssibly fatal. Surounded as I was with all the love
and attention that could be showered on me under Sheth Ambalal’s
roof, I began to get restless and urged him to remove me to the
Ashram. He had to yield to my importunity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Whilst I was thus tossing on the bed of pain in the Ashram, Sjt.
Vallabhbhai brought the news that Germany had been completely
defeated, and that the Commissioner had sent word that recruiting was
no longer necessary. The news that I had no longer to worry myself
about recruiting came as a very great relief.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I had now been trying hydropathy which gave some relief, but it was a
hard job to build up the body. The many medical advisers over-
whelmed me with advice, but I could not persuade myself to take
anything. Two or three suggested meat broth as a way out of the milk
vow, and cited authorities from Ayurveda in support of their advice.
One of them strongly recommended eggs. But for all of them I had but
one answer—no.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
For me the question of diet was not to be determined on the authority
of the Shastras. It was one interwoven with my course of life</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
which is guided by principles no longer depending upon outside
authority. I had no desire to live at the cost of them. How could I
relinquish a principle in respect of myself, when I had enforced it
relentlessly in respect of my wife, children and friends ?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
This protracted and first long illness in my life thus afforded me a
unique opportunity to examine my principles and to test them. One
night I gave myself up to despair. I felt that I was at death’s
door. I sent word to Anasuyabehn. She ran down to the Ashram.
Vallabhbhai came up with Dr. Kanuga, who felt my pulse and said :
‘Your pulse is quite good. I see absolutely no danger. This is a
nervous breakdown due to extreme weakness.’ But I was far from
being reassured. I passed the night without sleep.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The morning broke without death coming. But I could not get rid of
the feeling that the end was near, and so I began to devote all my
waking hours to listening to the <i>Gita </i>being read to me by the
inmates of the Ashram.<font size="1">T8 </font>I was incapable of
reading. I was hardly inclined to talk. The slightest talk meant a
strain on the brain. All interest in living had ceased, as I have
never liked to live for the sake of living. It was such an agony to

Whilst I lay thus ever expectant of death, Dr. Talvalkar came one day
with a strange creature. He hailed from Maharashtra. He was not known
to fame, but the moment I saw him I found that he was a crank like
myself. He had come to try his treatment on me. He had almost
finished his course of studies in the Grant Medical College without
taking the degree. Later I came to know that he was a member of the
Brahmo Samaj. Sjt. Kelkar, for that is his name, is a man of an
indep- endent and obstinate temperament. He swears by the ice
treatment, which he wanted to try on me. We gave him the name of ‘Ice
Doctor’.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>He is quite confident that he has discovered certain
things which have escaped qualified doctors. It is a pity both for
him and me that he has not been able to infect me with his faith in
his system. I believe in his system up to a certain point, but I am
afraid he has been hasty in arriving at certain conclusions.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But whatever may be the merits of his discoveries, I allowed him to
experiment on my body. I did not mind external treatment. The
treatment consisted in the application of ice all over the body.
Whilst I am unable to endorse his claim about the effect his
treatment had on me, it certainly infused in me a new hope and a new
energy, and the mind naturally reacted on the body. I began to have
appetite, and to</p>

in my diet. Said he : ‘I assure you that you will have more energy
and regain your strength quicker if you take raw eggs. Eggs are as
harm- less as milk. They certainly cannot come under the category of
meat.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
And do you know that all eggs are not fertilized ? There are
sterilized<font size="1">T9 </font>eggs in the market.’ I was not,

Friends and doctors assured me that I should recuperate quicker by a
change to Matheran, so I went there. But the water at Matheran being
very hard, it made my stay there extremely difficult. As a result of
the attack of the dysentery that I had, my anal tract had become
extremely tender, and owing to fissures, I felt an excruciating pain
at the time of evacuation, so that the very idea of eating filled me
with dread. Before the week was over I had to flee from Matheran.
Shank- erlal Banker now constituted himself the guardian of my
health, and pressed me to consult Dr. Dalal. Dr. Dalal was called
accordingly. His capacity for taking instantaneous decisions captured
me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He said : ‘ I cannot rebuild your body unless you take milk. If in
addition you would take iron and arsenic injections. I would
guarantee fully to renovate your constitution.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘You can give me the injections,’ I replied, ‘but milk is a 
different question; I have a vow against it.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm">
‘What exactly is the nature of your vow ?’ the doctor inquired.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I told him the whole history and the reasons behind my vow, how,
since I had come to know that the cow and the buffalo were subjected
to the process of <i>phooka</i>, I had conceived a strong disgust for
milk. Moreover, I had always held that milk is not the natural diet
of man. I had therefore abjured its use altogether. Kasturbai was
standing near my bed listening all the time to this conversation.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘But surely you cannot have any objection to goat’s milk then,’
she interposed.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The doctor too took up the strain. ‘If you will take goat’s milk,
it will be enough for me,’ he said.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I succumbed. My intense eagerness to take up satyagraha fight had
created in me a strong desire to live, and so I contented myself with
adhering to the letter of my vow only, and sacrificed its spirit. For
al-though I had only the milk of the cow and the she-buffalo in mind
when I took the vow, by natural implication it covered the milk of
all animals. Nor could it be right for me to use milk at all, so long
as I</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
held that milk is not the natural diet of man. Yet knowing all this I
agreed to take goat’s milk. The will to live proved stronger than
the devotion to truth, and for once the votary of truth compromised
his sacred ideal by his eager- ness to take up the stayagraha fight.
The memory of this action even now rankles in my breast and fills me
with remorse, and I am cons- tantly thinking how to give up goat’s
milk. But I cannot yet free myself from that subtlest of temptations,
the desire to serve, which still holds me.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My experiments in dietetics are dear to me as a part of my researches
in ahimsa. They give me recreation and joy. But my use of goat’s
milk today troubles me not from the view-point of dietetic ahimsa so
much as from that of truth, being no less than in breach of pledge.
It seems to me that I understand the ideal of truth better than that
of ahimsa, and my experience tells me that, if I let go my hold of
truth, I shall never be able to solve the riddle of ahimsa. The ideal
of truth requires that vows taken should be fulfilled in the spirit
as well in the letter. In the present case I killed the spirit—the
soul of my vow— by adhering to its outer form only, and that is
what galls me. But in spite of this clear knowledge I cannot see my
way straight before me. In other words, perhaps, I have not the
courage to follow the straight course. Both at bottom mean one and
the same thing, for doubt is invariably the result of want or
weakness of faith. ‘Lord, give me faith’ is, therefore, my prayer
day and night.</p>

live revived, especially God had kept work in store for me.<font size="1">T1</font></p>

I had hardly begun to feel my way towards rcovery, when I happened
casually to read in the papers the Rowlatt Committee’s report<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>which
had just been published. Its recommendations startled me. Shankarlal
Banker and Umar Sobani approached me with the suggestion that I
should take some prompt<font size="1">T2 </font>action in the matter.
In about a month I went to Ahmedabad. I mentioned my apprehensions to
Vallabhabhai, who used to come to see me almost daily. ‘Something
must be done,’ said I to him. ‘But what can we do in the
circum-stances ?’ he asked in reply. I answered, ‘If even a
handful of men can be found to sign the pledge of resistance, and the
proposed measure is passed into law in defiance of it,<font size="1">T3
</font>we ought to offer satyagraha at once. If I was not laid up
like this, I should give battle against it all alone, and expect
others to follow suit. But in my present helpless condition I feel
myself to be altogether unequal to the task.’</p>

The proposed conference was at last held at the Ashram. Hardly a
score of persons had been invited to it. So far as I remember, among
those who attended were, besides Vallabhabhai, Shrimati Sarojini
Naidu, Mr. Horniman, the late Mr. Umar Sobani, Sjt. Shankarlal Banker
and Shrimati Anasuyabehn. The stayagraha pledge<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>was
draf- ted at this meeting, and as far as I recollect, was signed by
all present. I was not editing any journal at that time, but I used
occasi-onally to ventilate my views through the daily Press. I
followed the practice on this occasion. Shankarlal Banker took up the
agitation in right earnest, and for the first time I got an idea of
his wonderful capacity for orga- nization and sustained work.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
As all hope of any of the existing institutions adopting a novel
weapon like satyagraha seemed to me to be in vain, a separate body
called the Satyagraha Sabha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>was established at my instance. Its prin- cipal
members were drawn from Bombay where, therefore, its headquarters
were fixed. The intending covenanters began to sign the satyagraha
pledge in large numbers, bulletins were issued, and popular meetings
began to be held everywhere recalling all the familiar feat- ures of
the Kheda campaign.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I became the president of the Satyagraha Sabha. I soon found that
there was not likely to be much chance of agreement between myself
and the intelligentsia composing this Sabha. My insistence on the use
of Gujarati in the Sabha, as also some of my other methods of work
that would appear to be peculiar, caused them no small worry and
embarrassment. I must say to their credit, however, that most of them
generously put up with my idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But from the very beginning it seemed clear to me that the Sabha was
not likely to live long. I could see that already my emph- asis on
truth and ahimsa had begun to be disliked by some of its members.
Nevertheless in its early stages our new activity went on at full
blast, and the movement gathered head rapidly.</p>

recommendations, and the Rowlatt Bill was published. I have attended
the proceedings of India’s legislative chamber only once in my
life, and that was on the occasion of the debate on this Bill.
Shastriji delivered an impassioned speech, in which he uttered a
solemn note of warning to the Government. The Viceroy seemed to be
listening spell- bound, his eyes rivetted on Shastriji as the latter
poured forth the hot stream of his eloquence. For the moment it
seemed to me as if the Victory could not but be deeply moved by it,
it was so true and so full of feeling.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But you can wake a man only if he is really asleep; no effort that
you may make will produce any effect upon him if he is merely
pretending sleep. That was precisely the Government’s position. It
was anxious only to go through the farce of legal formality. Its
decision had already been made. Shastriji’s solemn warning was,
therefore, entirely lost upon the Government.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In these circumstances mine could only be a cry in the wilde- rness.
I earnestly pleaded with the Viceroy, I addressed him private letters
as also public letters, in the course of which I clearly told him
that the Government’s action left me no other course except to
resort to satyagraha. But it was all in vain.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

The Bill had not yet been gazetted as an Act. I was in a very weak
condition, but when I received an invitation from Madras I decided to
take the risk of the long journey. I could not at that time
sufficiently raise my voice at meetings. The incapacity to address
meetings standing still abides. My entire frame would shake,  and
heavy throbbing would start on an attempt to speak standing for any

more active part in public life. It was with him that we had put up
in Madras. This discovery I made only after we had stayed with him
for  a couple of days. For since the bungalow that we were staying in
belonged to Sjt. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, I was under the impression
that we were his guests. Mahadev Desai, however, corrected me. He
very soon formed a close acquaintance with Rajagopalachari, who, from
his innate shyness, kept himself constantly in the background. But
Mahadev put me on my guard. ‘You should cultivate this man,’ he
said to me one day.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
And so I did. We daily discussed together plans of the fight, but
beyond the holding of public meetings I could not then think of any
other programme. I felt myself at a loss to discover how to offer
civil disobedience against the Rowlatt Bill if it was finally passed
into law. One could disobey it only if the Government  gave  one  the
opportunity fot it. Failing that, could we civilly disobey other laws
? And if so, where was the line to be drawn ? These and a host of
similar questions formed theme of these discussions of ours.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Sjt. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar called together a small conference of
leaders to thrash out the matter. Among those who took a conspicuous
part in it was Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari. He suggested that I should
draw up a comprehensive manual of the science of satyagraha,
embodying even minute details. I felt the task to be beyond my
capacity, and I confessed as much to him.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
While these cogitations were still going on, news was received that
the Rowlatt Bill had been published as an Act. That night I fell
asleep while thinking over the question. Towards the small hours of
the morning I woke up somewhat earlier than usual. I was still in
that twilight condition between sleep and consciousness when suddenly
the idea broke upon me—it was as if in a dream. Early in the
morning I related the whole story to Rajagopalachari.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The idea came to me last night in a dream that we should call upon
the country to observe a general hartal<font size="1">T2</font>.
Satyagraha is a process of self-purification, and ours is a sacred
fight, and it seems to me to be in the fitness of things that it
should be commenced with an act of self-purification. Let all the
people of India, there- fore, suspend their business on that day and
observe the day as one of fasting and prayer. The Mussalmans may not
fast for more than one day; so the duration of the fast should be 24
hours. It is very difficult to say whether all the provinces would
respond to this appeal of ours or not, but I feel fairly sure of
Bombay, Madras, Bihar and Sind. I think we should have every reason
to feel satisfied even if all these places observe the hartal
fittingly.’</p>

only a short notice of the hartal. As the work had to be started at
once, it was hardly possible to give longer notice.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
But who knows how it all came about ? The whole of India from one end
to the other, towns as well as villages, observed a complete hartal
on that day. It was a most wonderful spectacle.</p>

After a short tour in South India I reached Bombay, I think on the
4th April, having received a wire from Sjt. Shankarlal Banker asking
me to be present for the 6th of April celebrations.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But in the meanwhile Delhi had already observed the hartal on the
30th March. The word of the late Swami Shraddhanandji and Hakim Ajmal
Khan Saheb was law there. The wire about the postpon- ement of the
hartal till the 6th of April had reached there too late. Delhi had
never witnessed a hartal like that before. Hindus and Mussalmans
seemed united like one man. Swami Shraddhanandji was invited to
deliver a speech in the Jumma Masjid which he did. All this was more
than the authorities could bear. The police checked the hartal
procession as it was proceeding towards the railway station and
opened fire, causing a number of casualties, and the reign  of
repression commenced in Delhi. Shraddhanandji urgently summoned me to
Delhi. I wired back, saying I would start for Delhi immediately after
the 6th of April celebrations were over in Bombay.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The story of happenings in Delhi was repeated with variations in
Lahore and Amritsar. From Amritsar Drs. Satyapal and Kitchlew had
sent me a pressing invitation to go there. I was altogether unacqu-
ainted with them at that time, but I communicated to them my
intention to visit Amritsar after Delhi.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
On the morning of the 6th citizens of Bombay flocked in their
thous-ands to the Chaupati for a bath in the sea, after which they
moved on in a procession to Thakurdvar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

children, while the Mussalmans joined it in large numbers. From

procession were taken by the Mussalman friends to a mosque near by,
where Mrs. Naidu and myself were persuaded to deliver speeches. Sjt.
Vithaldas Jerajani proposed that we should then and there administer
the Swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity pledges to the people, but I
resisted the proposal on the ground  that pledges should not be
administered or taken in precipitate hurry, and that we should be
satisfied with what was already being done by the people. A pledge
once taken, I argued, must not be broken afterwards; therefore it was
necessary that the implications of the Swadeshi pledge should  be
clearly understood, and the grave responsibility entailed by the
pledge regarding Hindu-Muslim unity fully realized by all concerned.
In the end I suggested that those who wanted to take the pledges
should again assemble<font size="1">T1 </font>on the following morning
for the purpose.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Needless to say<font size="1">T2 </font>the hartal in Bombay was a
complete success. Full preparation had been made for starting civil
disobedience. Two or three things had been discussed in this
connection. It was decided that civil disobedience might be offered
in respect of such laws only as<font size="1">T3 </font>easily lent
themselves to being disobeyed by the masses. The salt tax was
extremely unpopular and a powerful movement had been for some time
past going on to secure its repeal. I therefore suggested that the
people might prepare salt from sea-water in their own houses in
disregard of the salt laws. My other suggestion was about the sale of
proscribed literature. Two of my books, viz, <i>Hind </i><i>Swaraj
</i>and <i>Sarvodaya </i>(Gujarati adaptation of Ruskin’s <i>Unto
This Last</i>), which had been already proscribed, came handy for
this purpose.<font size="1">T4 </font>To print and sell them openly
seemed to be the easiest way of offering civil disobedience. A
sufficient number of copies of the books was  therefore printed, and
it was arranged to sell them at the end of the monster meeting that
was to be held that evening after the breaking of the fast.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
On the evening of the 6th an army of volunteers issued forth
accordingly with this prohibited literature to sell it among the
people. Both Shrimati Sarojini Devi and I went out in cars. All the
copies where soon sold out. The proceeds of the sale were to be
utilized for furthering the civil disobedience campaign. Both these
books were priced at four annas per copy, but I hardly remember
anybody having purchased them from me<font size="1">T5 </font>at their
face value merely. Quite a large number of people simply poured out
all the cash that was in their pockets to purchase their copy. Five
and ten rupee notes just flew out to cover the price of a single
copy, while in one case I remember having sold a copy for fifty
rupees ! It was duly explained to the people that they were liable to
be arrested and imprisoned for purchasing the proscribed literature.
But for the moment they had</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
shed all fear of jail-going.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
It was subsequently learnt <font size="1">T6 </font>that the Government
had conveniently taken the view that the books that had been
proscribed by it had not in fact been sold, and that what we had sold
was not held as coming under the definition of proscribed literature.
The reprint was held by the Government to be a new edition of the
books that had been proscribed, and to sell them did not constitute
an offence under the law. This news caused general disappointment.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The next morning another meeting was held for the admin- istration of
the pledges with regard to swadeshi and Hindu-Muslim unity. Vithaldas
Jerajani for the first time realized that all is not gold that
glitters. Only a handful of persons came. I distinctly remember some
of the sisters who were present on that occasion. The men who
attended were also very few. I had already drafted the pledge and
brought it with me. I thoroughly explained its meaning to those
present before I administered it to them. The paucity of the attenda-
nce neither pained nor surprised me, for I have noticed this
characteristic difference in the popular attitude—partiality for
exciting work, dislike for quiet constructive effort. The difference
has persisted to this day.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But I shall have to devote to this subject a chapter by itself. To
return to the story. On the night of the 7th I started for Delhi and
Amr-itsar. On reaching Mathura on the 8th I first heard rumours about
my probable arrest. At the next stoppage after Mathura, Acharya
Gidwani came to meet me, and gave me difinite news that I was to be
arrested, and offered his services to me if I should need them. I
thanked him for the offer, assuring him that I would not fail to
avail myself of it, if and when I felt it necessary.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Before the train had reached Palwal railway station, I was served
with a written order<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>to
the effect that I was prohibited from entering the boundary of the
Punjab, as my presence there was likely to result in a distrubance of
the peace. I was asked by the police to get down from the train. I
refused to do so saying, ‘I want to go to Punjab in response to a
pressing invitation, not to foment unrest, but to allay it, I am
therefore sorry that it is not possible for me to comply with this
order.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
At last the train reached Palwal. Mahadev was with me. I asked him to
proceed to Delhi to convey to Swami Shraddhanandji the news about
what had happened and to ask the people to remain calm. He was to
explain why<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T7</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

At Palwal railway station I was taken out of the train and put under
police custody. A train from Delhi came in a short time. I was made
to enter a third-class carriage, the police party accompanying. On
reaching Mathura, I was taken to the police barracks, but no police
official could tell me as to what they proposed to do with me or
where  I was to be taken next. Early at 4 o’clock the next morning
I was waked up and put in a goods train that was going towards
Bomaby. At noon I was again made to get down at Sawai Madhopur. Mr.
Bowring, Inspector of Police, who arrived by the mail train from
Lahore, now took charge of me. I was put in a first-class compartment
with him. And from an ordinary prisoner I became a ‘gentleman’
prisoner. The officer commenced a long panegyric of Sir Michael
O’Dwyer. Sir Michael had nothing against me personally, he went on,
only he apprehended a distrubance of the peace if I entered the
Punjab and so on. In the end he requested me to return to Bombay of
my own accord and agree not to cross the frontier of the Punjab. I
replied that  I could not possibly complay with the order, and that I
was not prepa- red of my own accord to go back. Whereupon the
officer, seeing no other course, told me that he would have to
enforce the law against me. ‘But what do you want to do with me ?’
I asked him. He replied that he himself did not know, but was
awaiting further orders. ‘For the present,’ he said, ‘I am
taking you to Bombay.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
We reached Surat. Here I was made over to the charge of an- other
police officer. ‘You are now free,’ the officer told me when we
had reached Bombay. ‘It would however be better,’ he added, ‘If
you get down near the Marine Lines where I shall get the train
stopped for you. At Colaba there is likely to be a big crowd.’ I
told him that I would be glad to follow his wish. He was pleased and
thanked me for it. Accordingly I alighted at the Marine Lines. The
carriage of a friend just happened to be passing by. It took me and
left me at Revashankar Jhaveri’s place. The friend told me that the
news of my arrest had incensed the people and roused them to a pitch
of mad frenzy. ‘An outbreak is apprehended every minute near
Pydhuni, the Magistrate and the police have already arrived there,’
he added.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Scarcely had I reached my destination, when Umar Sobani and
Anasuyabehn arrived and asked me to motor to Pydhuni at once. ‘The
people have become impatient, and are very much excited,’ they
asid, we cannot pacify them. Your presence alone can do it.’</p>

I got into the car. Near Pydhuni I saw that a huge crowd had
gathered. On seeing me the people went mad with joy. A procession was
immediately formed, and the sky was rent with the shouts of <i>Vande
mataram </i>and <i>Allaho Akbar</i>. At Pydhuni we sighted a body of
mounted police. Brickbats were raining down from above. I besought
the crowd to be calm, but it seemed as if we should not be able to
escape the shower of brickbats. As the procession issued out of Abdur
Rahman Street and was about to proceed towards the  Crawford Market,
it suddenly found itself confronted by a body of the mounted police,
who had arrived there to prevent it from proceeding further in the
direction of the Fort. The crowd was densely packed. It had almost
broken through the police cordon. There was hardly any chance of my
voice being heard in that vast concourse. Just then the officer in
charge of the mounted police gave the order to disperse the crowd,
and at once the mounted party charged upon the crowd brandishing
their lances as they went. For a moment I felt that I would be
hurt.<font size="1">T9 </font>But my apprehension was groundless, the
lances just grazed the car as the lancers swiftly passed by. The
ranks of the people were soon broken, and they were thrown into utter
confusion, which was soon converted into a rout. Some got trampled
under foot, others were badly mauled and crushed. In that seething
mass of humanity there was hardly any room for the horses to pass,
nor was there an exit by which the people could disperse. So the
lancers blindly cut their way through the crowd. I hardly imagine
they could see what they were doing. The whole thing presented a most
dreadful spectacle. The horsemen and the people were mixed together
in mad confusion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus the crowd was dispersed and its progress checked. Our motor was
allowed to proceed. I had it stopped before the Commi- ssioner’s
office, and got down to complain to him about the conduct of the
police.</p>

So I went to the Commissioner Mr. Griffith’s office. All about the
staircase leading to the office I saw soldiers armed from top to toe,
as though for military action. The verandah was all astir. When I was
admitted to the office, I saw Mr. Bowring sitting with Mr. Griffith.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I described to the Commissioner the scenes I had witnessed. He
replied briefly : ‘I did not want the procession to proceed to the
Fort, as a disturbance was inevitable there. And as I saw that the
people would not listen to persuation, I could not help ordering the
mounted police to charge through the crowd.’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">
‘But,’ said I, ‘You knew what the consequences must be. The</p>

horses were bound to trample on the people. I think it was quite
unnecessary to send that contingent of mounted men.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘You cannot judge that,’ said Mr. Griffith. ‘We police officers
know better than you the effect of your teaching on the people. If we
did not start with drastic measures, the situation would pass out of
our hands. I tell you that the people are sure to go out of your
control. Disobedience of law will quickly appeal to them; it is
beyond them to understand the duty of keeping peaceful. I have no
doubt about your intentions, but the people will not understand them.
They will follow their natural instinct.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
‘It is there that I join issue with you,’ I replied. ‘The
people are not by nature violent but peaceful.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And thus we argued at length. Ultimately Mr. Griffith said, ‘But
suppose you were convinced that your teaching had been lost on the
people, what would you do ?’</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 118%">
‘I should suspend civil disobedience if I were so convinced.’
‘What do you mean ? You told Mr. Bowring that you would</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.37cm">
proceed to the Punjab the moment you were released.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Yes, I wanted to do so by the next available train. But it is out
of the question today.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘If you will be patient, the conviction is sure to grow on you. Do
you know what is happening in Ahmedabad? And what has happened in
Amritsar? People have everywhere gone nearly mad. I am not yet in
possession of all the facts. The telegraph wires have been cut in
some places. I put it to you that the responsibility for all these
disturbances lies on you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I assure you I should readily take it upon myself wherever I
discovered it. But I should be deeply pained and surprised, if I
found that there were disturbances in Ahmedabad. I cannot answer for
Amri- tsar. I have never been there, no one knows me there. But even
about the Punjab I am certain of this much that, had not the Punjab
Gover- nment prevented my entry into the Punjab, I should have been
considerably helpful in keeping the peace there. By preventing me
they gave the people unnecessary provocation.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
And so we argued on and on. It was impossible for us to agree. I told
him that I intended to address a meeting on Chaupati and to ask the
people to keep the peace, and took leave of him. The meeting was held
on the Chaupati sands. I spoke at length on the duty of non- violence
and on the limitations of satyagraha, and said : ‘Satyagraha is
essentially a weapon of the truthful. A satyagrahi is pledged to non-
violence, and, unless people observe it in thought, word and deed,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I</p>

cannot offer mass satyagraha.’<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Anasuyabehn, too, had received news of disturbances in Ahm- edabad.
Someone had spread a rumour that she also had been  arrested. The
mill-hands had gone mad over her rumoured arrest, struck work and
committed acts of violence, and a sergeant had been done to death.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
I proceeded to Ahmedabad. I learnt that an attempt had been made to
pull up the rails near the Nadiad railway station, that a Gover-
nment officer had been murdered in Viramgam, and that Ahmedabad was
under martial law. The people were terrorstricken. They had indulged
in acts of violence and were being made to pay for them with
interest.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
A police officer was waiting at the station to escort me to Mr.
Pratt, the Commissioner. I found him in a state of rage. I spoke to
him gently, and expressed my regret for the disturbances<font size="1">T2</font>—I
suggested that martial law was unnecessary, and declared my readiness
to co- operate in all efforts to restore peace. I asked for
permission to hold a public meeting on the grounds of the Sabarmati 
Ashram.  The proposal appealed to him, and the meeting was held, I
think, on Sunday, the 13th of April, and martial law was withdrawn
the same day or the day after. Addressing the meeting, I tried to
bring home to the people the sense of their wrong, declared a
penitential fast of three days for myself, appealed to the people to
go on a similar fast for a day, and suggested to those who had been
guilty of acts of violence to confess their guilt.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I saw my duty as clear as daylight. It was unbearable for me to find
that the labourers, amongst whom I had spent a good deal of my time,
whom I had served, and from whom I had expected better things, had
taken part in the riots, and I felt I was a sharer in their guilt.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Just as I suggested to the people to confess their guilt, I 
suggested to the Government to condone the crimes. Neither accepted
my suggestion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The late Sir Ramanbhai and other citizens of Ahmedabad came to me
with an appeal to suspend satyagraha. The appeal was needless, for I
had already made up my mind to suspend satyagraha so long as people
had not learnt the lesson of peace. The friends went away happy.</p>

firmly of opinion that those who wanted to lead the people to
satyagraha ought to be able to keep the people within the limited
non-violence expected of them. I hold the same opinion even today.</p>

HIMALAYAN MISCALCULATION’</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.25cm; line-height: 95%">
Almost immeditely after the Ahmedabad meeting I went to Nadiad. It
was here that I first used the expression ‘Himalayan
miscalculation’ which obtained such a wide currency afterwards.
Even at Ahmeda-bad I had begun to have a dim perception of my
mistake. But when I reached Nadiad and saw the actual state of things
there and heard reports about a large number of people from Kheda
district having been arrested, it suddenly dawned upon me that I had
com- mitted a grave error in calling upon the people in the Kheda
district and elsewhere to launch upon civil disobedience prematurely,
as it now seemed to me.<font size="1">T1 </font>I was addressing a
public meeting.<font size="1">T2 </font>My confession brought down upon
me no small amount of ridicule. But I have never regretted having
made that confession. For I have always held that it is only when one
sees one’s own mistakes with a convex lens, and does just the
reverse in the case of others, that one is able to arrive at a just
relative estimate of the two. I further believe that a scrupulous and
conscientious observance of this rule is necessary for one who wants
to be a satyagrahi.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Let us now see what that Himalayan miscalculation was. Before one can
be fit for the practice of civil disobedience one must have rendered
a willing and respectful obedience to the State laws. For the most
part we obey such laws out of fear of the penalty for their breach,
and this holds good particularly in respect of such laws as do not
involve a moral principle. For instance, an honest, respectable man
will not suddenly take to stealing, whether there is a law against
steal- ing or not, but this very man will not feel any remorse for
failure to observe the rule about carrying head-lights on bicycles
after dark. Indeed it is doubtful whether he would even accept advice
kindly about being more careful in this respect. But he would observe
any obligatory rule of this kind, if only to escape the inconvenience
of facing a prosecution for a breach of the rule. Such compliance is
not, however, the willing and spontaneous obedience that is required
of a satyagrahi. A satyagrahi obeys the laws of society intelligently
and of</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
his own free will, because he considers it to be his sacred duty to
do so. It is only when a person has thus obeyed the laws of society
scrupulously that he is in a position to judge as to which particular
rules are good and just and which unjust and iniquitous. Only then
does the right accrue to him of the civil disobedience of certain
laws in well-defined circumstances. My error lay in my faliure to
observe this necessary limitation.<font size="1">T3 </font>I had called
on the people to launch upon civil disobedience before they had thus
qualified themselves for it, and this mistake seemed to me of
Himalayan magnitude. As soon as I entered the Kheda district, all the
old recollections of the Kheda Satyagraha struggle came back to me,
and I wondered how I could have failed to perceive what was so
obvious. I realized that before a people could be fit for offering
civil disobedience, they should thoroughly understand its deeper
implications.<font size="1">T4 </font>That being so, before
restarting<font size="1">T5 </font>civil disobedience on a mass scale,
it would be necessary to create a band of well-tried,<font size="1">T6
</font>pure-hearted volunteers who thoroughly understood the strict
conditions of satyagraha. They could explain these to the people, and
by sleepless vigilance keep them on the right path.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
With these thoughts filling my mind I reached Bombay, raised a corps
of satyagrahi volunteers through the Satyagraha Sabha there, and with
their help commenced the work of educating the people with regard to
the meaning and inner significance of satyagraha. This was
princi-pally done by issuing leaflets of an educative character
bearing on the subject.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
But whilst this work was going on, I could see that it was a
difficult task to interest the people in the peaceful side of
satyagraha. The volunteers too failed to enlist themselves in large
numbers. Nor did all those who actually enlisted take anything like a
regular systematic training, and as the days passed by, the number of
fresh recruits began gradually to dwindle instead of to grow.<font size="1">T7
</font>I realized that the progress of the training in civil
disobedience was not going to be as rapid as I had at first expected.</p>

Thus, whilst this movement for the preservation of non-violence was
making steady though slow progress on the one hand, Government’s
policy of lawless repression was in full career on the other, and was
manifesting itself in the Punjab in all its nakedness. Leaders were
put under arrest, martial law, which in other words meant</p>

no law, was proclaimed, special tribunals were set up. These
tribunals were not courts of justice but instruments for carrying out
the arbitrary will of an autocrat. Sentences were passed unwarranted
by evidence and in flagrant violation of justice. In Amritsar
innocent men and women were made to crawl like worms on their
bellies. Before this outrage the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy paled into
insignificance in my eyes, though it was this massacre principally
that attracted the attention of the people of India and of the world.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was pressed to proceed to the Punjab immediately in disregard of
consequences. I wrote and also telegraphed to the Viceroy asking for
permission to go there, but in vain. If I proceeded without the
necessary permission, I should not be allowed to cross the boundary
of the Punjab, but left to find what satisfaction I could from civil
disobedience. I was thus confronted by a serious dilemma. As things
stood, to break the order against my entry into the Punjab could, it
seemed to me, hardly be classed as civil disobedience, for I did not
see around me the kind of peaceful atmosphere that I wanted, and the
unbr-idled repression in the Punjab had further served to aggravate
and deepen the feelings of resentment. For, me, therefore, to offer
civil disobedience at such a time, even if it were possible, would
have been like fanning the flame. I therefore decided not to proceed
to the Punjab in spite of the suggestion of friends. It was bitter
pill for me to swallow. Tales of rank injustice and oppression came
pouring in daily from the Punjab, but all I could do was to sit
helplessly by and gnash my teeth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Just then Mr. Horniman, in whose hands <i>The </i><i>Bombay </i><i>Chronicle
</i>had become a formidable force, was suddenly spirited away by the
authorities. This act of the Government seemed to me to be surro-
unded by a foulness which still stinks in my nostrils.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
know that Mr. Horniman never desired lawlessness. He had not liked my
breaking the prohibitory order of the Punjab Government without the
permi- ssion of the Satyagraha Committee, and had fully endorsed  the
decision to suspend civil disobedience. I had even received from him
a letter advising suspension before I had announced my decision to
that effect. Only owing to the distance between Bombay and Ahme-
dabad I got the letter after the announcement. His sudden deportation
therefore caused me as much pain as surprise.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
As a result of these developments I was asked by the directors of <i>The

remained to be done by me, but as usual with my nature, the responsi-

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
But the Government came as it were to my rescue, for by its order the
publication of <i>The Chronicle </i>had to be suspended.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The friends who were directing the management of <i>The Chro- nicle,
</i>viz., Messrs Umar Sobani and Shankarlal Banker, were at this time
also controlling <i>Young India</i>. They suggested that, in view of
the suppression of <i>The Chronicle</i>, I should now take up the
editor- ship of <i>Young India</i>, and that, in order to fill the
gap left by the former, <i>Young India </i>should be converted from a
weekly into a bi- weekly organ.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>This was what I felt also. I was anxious to expound 
the inner meaning of satygraha to the public, and also hoped that
through this effort I should at least be able to do justice to the
Punjab situation. For, behind all I wrote, there was potential
satyagraha,<font size="1">T2 </font>and the Government knew as much. I
therefore readily  accepted  the suggestion made by these friends.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
But how could the general public be trained in satyagraha through the
medium of English ? My principal field of work lay in Gujarat. Sjt.
Indulal Yajnik was at that time associated with the group of Messrs
Sobani and Banker. He was conducting the  Gujarati monthly <i>Navajivan
</i>which had the financial backing of these friends. They placed the
monthly at my disposal, and further Sjt. Indulal offered to work on
it. This monthly was converted into a weekly.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In the meantime <i>The Chronicle </i>was resuscitated. <i>Young India
</i>was therefore restored to its original weekly form. To have
published the two weeklies from two different places would have been
very inc- onvenient to me and involved more expenditure. As <i>Navajivan
</i>was already being published from Ahmedabad <i>Young India </i>was
also removed there at my suggestion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were other reasons besides for this  change.<font size="1">T3  </font>I
 had already learnt from my experience of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion
</i>that such journals needed a press of their own. Moreover the
press laws in force in India at that time were such that, if I wanted
to express my views untrammelled, the existing printing presses,
which were naturally run for business, would have hesitated to
publish them. The need for setting up a press of our own, therefore,
became all the more imperative, and since this could be conveniently
done only at Ahm- edabad, <i>Young India </i>too had to be taken
there.</p>

Through these journals I now commenced to the best of my ability the
work of educating the reading public in satyagraha. Both of them<font size="1">T4

the neighbourhood of forty thousand each. But while  the circulation

disobedience was out of the question, they enabled me freely to
ventilate my views and to put heart into the people.<font size="1">T5

the people in this hour of trial, and did their humble bit towards
lightening the tyranny of the martial law.</p>

were in fact even worse than the Press reports had showed. He pressed
me urgently to come and join him. At the same time Malaviyaji sent
telegrams asking me to proceed to the Punjab at once. I once more

The scene that I witnessed on my arrival at Lahore can never be
effaced from my memory. The railway station was from end to end one
seething mass of humanity. The entire populace had turned out of
doors in eager expectation, as if to meet a dear relation after a
long separation, and was delirious with joy. I was put up at the late
Pandit Rambhaj Dutt’s bungalow, and the burden of entertaining me
fell on the shoulders of Shrimati Sarala Devi<font size="1">T6</font>.
A burden it truly was, for even then, as now, the place where I was
accommodated became a veritable caravanserai.</p>

Owing to the principal Punjab leaders being in jail, their place, I
found, had been properly<font size="1">T7 </font>taken up by Pandit
Malaviyaji, Pandit Motilalji and the late Swami Shraddhanandji.
Malaviyaji and Shradd- hanandji I had known intimately before, but
this was the first occasion on which I came in close personal contact
with Motilalji. All these leaders, as also such local leaders as had
escaped the privilege of  going to jail, at once made me feel
perfectly at home amongst them, so that I never felt like a stranger

of Government’s tyranny and the arbitrary despotism of its officers

that I wish to say here about it is that there is not a single

only a fraction of what was in the Com- mittee’s possession. Not a
single statement, regarding the validity of which there was the

truth and nothing but the truth, will enable the reader to see to
what lengths the British Government is capable of going, and what
inhumanities and barbarities it is capable of perpetrating in order
to maintain its power. So far as I am aware, not a single statement

to deliberate on the Khilafat question.<font size="1">T1 </font>Among
the signatories to it were the late Hakim Ajmal Khan Saheb and Mr.
Asaf Ali. The late Swami Shraddhanandji, it was stated, would be
attending and, if I remember aright, he was to be the vice-president
of the conference, which, so far as I can recollect, was to be held
in the November of that year. The confe-rence was to deliberate on
the situation arising out of the Khilafat betra-yal, and on the
question as to whether the Hindus and Mussalmans should take any part
in the peace celebrations. The letter of invitation went on to say,
among other things, that not only the Khilafat question but the
question of cow-protection as well would be discussed at the
conference, and it would,  therefore,  afford  a golden opportunity
for a settlement of the cow question. I did not like this reference
to the cow question. In my letter in reply to the invitation,
therefore, whilst promising to do my best to attend, I suggested that
the two questions should not be mixed up together or considered in
the spirit of a bargain, but should be decided on their own merits
and treated separately.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; text-indent: 0cm; line-height: 0.38cm">
With these thoughts filling my mind,<font size="1">T2  </font>I  went
to the conference.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
It was a very well attended gathering, though it did not present the
spectacle of later gatherings that were attended by tens of
thousands. I discussed the question referred to above with the late
Swami Shraddhanandji, who was present at the conference. He
appreciated my argument and left it to me to place it before the
conference. I likewise discussed it with the late Hakim Saheb. Before
the conference I contended that, if the Khilafat question had a just
and legitimate basis, as I believe it had, and if the Government had
really committed a gross injustice, the Hindus were bound to stand by
the Mussalmans in their demand for the redress of the Khilafat wrong.
It would ill bec- ome them to bring in the cow question in this
connection, or to use the occasion to make terms with the Mussalmans,
just as it would ill become the Mussalmans to offer to stop
cow-slaughter as a price for the Hindus’ support on the Khilafat
question. But it would be another matter and quite graceful, and
reflect great credit on them, if the Mussalmans of their own free
will stopped  cow-slaughter  out of regard for the religious
sentiments of the Hindus, and from a sense of duty towards them as
neighbours and children of the same soil. To take up such an
independent attitude was, I contended, their duty, and would enhance
the dignity of their conduct. But if the Mussalmans considered it as
their neighbourly duty to stop cow-slaughter, they should do so
regardless of whether the Hindus helped them in the Khilafat or not.
‘That being so,’ I argued, ‘the two questions should be
discussed independently of each other, and the deliberations of the</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
conference should be confined to the question of the Khilafat only.’
My argument appealed to those present and, as a result, the question
of cow-protection was not discussed at this conference.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But in spite of my warning Maulana Abdul Bari Saheb said : ‘No
matter whether the Hindus help us or not, the Mussalmans ought, as
the countrymen of the Hindus, out of regard for the latter’s
susceptibilities, to give up cow-slaughter.’ And at one time it
almost looked as if they would really put an end to it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There was a suggestion from some quarters that the Punjab question
should be tacked on to that of the Khilafat wrong. I opposed the
proposal. The Punjab question, I said, was a local affair and could
not therefore weigh with us in our decision to participate or not in
the peace celebrations<font size="1">T3</font>. If we mixed up the
local question with the Khilafat question, which arose directly out
of the peace terms,<font size="1">T4 </font>we should be guilty of a
serious indiscretion. My argument easily carried conviction.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Maulana Hasrat Mohani was present in this meeting. I had known him
even before, but it was only here that I discovered what a fighter he
was. We differed from each other almost from the very beginning, and
in several matters the differences have persisted.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Among the numerous resolutions that were passed at this conf- erence,
one called upon both Hindus and Mussalmans to take the swadeshi vow,
and as a natural corollary to it, to boycott foreign goods<font size="1">T5</font>.
Khadi had not as yet found its proper place.<font size="1">T6 </font>This
was not a resolution that Hasrat Saheb would accept. His object was
to wreak vengeance on the British Empire, in case justice was denied
in the matter of the Khilafat. Accordingly, he brought in a counter
proposal for the boycott purely of British goods so far as
practicable. I oppo- sed it on the score of principle, as also of
practicability, adducing for it those arguments that have now become
pretty familiar. I also put before the conference my viewpoint of
non-violence. I noticed that my arguments made a deep impression on
the audience. Before me, Hasrat Mohani’s speech had been received
with such loud acclamations that I was afraid that mine only be a cry
in the wild- erness. I had made bold to speak only because I felt
that it would be a dereliction of duty not to lay my views before the
conference. But, to my agreeable surprise, my speech was followed
with the closest attention by those present, and evoked a full
measure of support among those on the platform, and speaker after
speaker rose to deliver speeches in support of my views. The leaders
were able to see that not</p>

only would the boycott of British goods fail of its purpose, but
would, if adopted, make of them a laughing stock. There was hardly a
man present in that assembly but had some article of British
manufacture on his person. Many of the audience therefore realized
that nothing but harm could result from adopting a resolution that
even those who voted for it were unable to carry out.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Mere boycott of foreign cloth cannot satisfy us, for who knows how
long it will be, before we shall be able to manufacture swadeshi
cloth in sufficient quantity for our needs, and before we can bring
about an effective boycott of foreign cloth ? We want something that
will produce an immediate effect on the British. Let your boycott of
foreign cloth stand, we do not mind it, but give us something
quicker, and speedier in addition’—so spoke in  effect  Maulana 
Hasrat Mohani. Even as I was listening to him, I felt that something
new, over and above boycott of foreign cloth, would be necessary. An
imme- diate boycott of foreign cloth seemed to me also to be a clear
impo- ssibility, at that time. I did not then know that we could, if
we liked, produce enough khadi for all our clothing requirements;
this was only  a later discovery. On the other hand, I knew even then
that, if we depended on the mills alone for effecting the boycott of
foreign cloth, we should be betrayed. I was still in the middle of
this dilemma when the Maulana concluded his speech.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I was handicapped for want of suitable Hindi or Urdu words. This was
my first occasion for delivering an argumentative speech before an
audience especially composed of Mussalmans  of the North.<font size="1">T7
</font>I had spoken in Urdu<font size="1">T8 </font>at the Muslim
League at Calcutta, but  it was only for a few minutes, and the
speech was intended only to be feeling appeal to the audience. Here,
on the contrary, I was faced with a critical, if not hostile,
audience, to whom I had to explain and bring home my view-point. But
I had cast aside all shyness. I was not there to deliver an address
in the faultless, polished Urdu of the Delhi Musl- ims, but to place
before the gathering my views in such broken Hindi as I could
command. And in this I was successful. This meeting afforded me a
direct proof of the fact that Hindi-Urdu alone could become the
lingua franca of India. Had I spoken in English, I could not have
produced the impression that I did on the audience, and the Maulana
might not have felt called upon to deliver his challenge. Nor, if he
had delivered it, could I have taken it up effectively.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I could not hit upon a suitable Hindi or Urdu word for the new idea,
and that put me out somewhat. At last I described it by the word
‘non-co-operation’, an expression that I used for the first time
at this meeting. As the Maulana was delivering his speech, it seemed
to me that it was vain for him to talk about effective resistance to
a Gove-</p>

rnment with which he was co-operating in more than one thing. If
resort to arms was impossible or undesirable, the only true
resistance to the Government, it therefore seemed to me, was to cease
to co- operate with it. Thus I arrived at the word non-co-operation.
I had not then a clear idea of all its manifold implications. I
therefore did not enter into details. I simply said :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘The Mussalmans have adopted a very<font size="1">T9 </font>important
resolution. If the peace terms are unfavourable to them—which may
God forbid— they will stop all co-operation with Government. It is
an inalienable right of the people thus to withhold co-operation. We
are not bound to retain Government titles and honours, or to continue
in Govern- ment service. If Government should betray us in a great
cause like the Khilafat, we could not do otherwise than
non-co-operate. We are therefore entitled to non-co-operate with
Government in case of a betrayal.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But months elapsed before the word non-co-operation became current
coin. For the time being it was lost in the proceedings of the
conference. Indeed when I supported the co-operation resolution at
the Congress which met at Amritsar a month later, I did so in the
hope that the betrayal would never come.<font size="1">T10</font></p>

The Punjab Government could not keep in confinement the hundreds of
Punjabis who, under the martial law regime, had been clapped into
jail on the strength of the most meagre evidence by tribunals that
were courts only in name. There was such an outcry all round against
this flagrant piece of injustice that their further incarceration
became impossible. Most of the prisoners were released before the
Congress opened. Lala Harkishanlal and the other leaders were all
released, while the session of the Congress was still in progress.<font size="1">T1
</font>The Ali Brothers too arrived there straight from Jail. The
people’s joy knew no bounds. Pandit Motilal Nehru, who, at the
sacrifice of his splendid practice, had made the Punjab his
headquarters and had done great service, was the President of the
Congress; the late Swami Shraddhanandji was the Chairman of the
Reception Committee.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Up to this time my share in the annual proceedings of the Congress
was confined only to the constructive advocacy of Hindi by making
my<font size="1">T2 </font>speech in the national language, and to
presenting in that speech the case of the Indians overseas. Nor did I
expect to be called upon to do anything more this year. But, as had
happened on many a previous occasion, responsible work came to me all
of a sudden.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">

</font>announcement on the new reforms<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>had
just been issued. It was not wholly satisfactory even to me, and  was
unsatisfactory to everyone else. But I felt at that time that the
reforms though defective, could still be accepted. I felt in the
King’s<font size="1">T4 </font>announcement and its language the hand
of Lord Sinha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, and it lent a ray of hope. But experienced stalwarts
like the late Lokamanya and Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das shook their
heads. Pandit Malaviyaji was neutral.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Pandit Malaviyaji had harboured me in his own room. I had a glimpse
of the simplicity of his life on the occasion of the foundation
ceremony of the Hindu University,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>but
on this occasion, being in the same room with him, I was able to
observe his daily routine in the closest detail, and what I saw
filled me with joyful surprise. His room presented the appearance of
a free inn for all the poor. You could hardly cross from one end to
the other. It was so crowded. It was accessible at all hours to
chance visitors who had the licence to take as much of his time as
they liked. In a corner of this  crib  lay  my charpoy in all its
dignity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But I may not occupy this chapter with a description of Malaviyaji’s
mode of living, and must return to my subject.   I   was  thus
enabled to hold daily discussions with Malaviyaji, who used lovingly
to explain to me, like an elder brother, the various viewpoints of
the different parties. I saw that my participation in the
deliberations on the resolution on the reforms was inevitable<font size="1">T5</font>.
Having<font size="1">T6 </font>had my share of responsibility in the
drawing-up of the Congress report on the Punjab wrongs, I felt that
all that still remained to be done in that connection must claim my
attention<font size="1">T7</font>. There had to be dealings with
Government in that matter. Then similarly there was the Khilafat
question. I further believed at that time that Mr. Montagu would not
betray or allow India’s cause to be betrayed. The release of the
Ali Brothers and other prisoners too seemed to me to be an auspicious
sign. In the circumstances I felt that a resolution not rejecting but
accepting the reforms was the correct thing. Deshbandhu Chittaranjan</p>

Das, on the other hand, held firmly to the view that the reforms
ought to be rejected as wholly inadequate and unsatisfactory. The
late Lokamanya was more or less neutral, but had decided to throw in
his weight on the side of any resolution that the Deshbandhu might
approve.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The idea of having to differ from such seasoned, well-tried and
universally revered leaders was unbearable to me. But on the other
hand the voice of conscience was clear. I tried to run away from the
Congress and suggested to Pandit Malaviyaji and Motilalji  that  it
would be in the general interest if I absented<font size="1">T8 </font>myself
from the  Congress for rest of session. It would save me from having
to make an exhibition of my difference with such esteemed leaders.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.43cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
But my suggestion found no favour with these two seniors. The news of
my proposal was somehow whispered to Lala Harkishanlal. ‘This will
never do. It will very much hurt the feelings of the Punjabis, he
said. I discussed the matter with Lokamanya, Deshbandhu and Mr.
Jinnah, but no way out could be found. Finally I laid bare my
distress to Malaviyaji. ‘I see no prospect of a compromise,’ I
told him, ‘and if  I am to move my resolution, a division will have
to be called and votes taken. But I do not find here any arrangements
for it. The practice in the open session of the Congress so far has
been to take votes by a show of hands with the result that all
distinction between visitors and delegates is lost, while, as for
taking a count of votes in such vast assemblies, we have no means at
all. So it comes to this that, even if I want to call a division
there will be no facility for it, nor meaning in it.’ But Lala
Harkishanlal came to the rescue and undertook to make the necessary
arrangements. ‘We will not,’ he said, ‘permit visitors in the
Congress <i>pandal </i>on the day on which voting is to take place.
And as for taking the count, well, I shall see to that. But you must
not absent yourself from the Congress.’ I capitulated; I framed my
resol- ution, and in heart trembling undertook to move it. Pandit
Ma-laviyaji and Mr. Jinnah were to support it. I could notice that,
although our difference of opinion was free from any trace of
bittern-ess, and although our speeches too contained nothing but cold
reasoning, the people<font size="1">T9 </font>could not stand the very
fact of a difference<font size="1">T10 </font>; it pained them. They
wanted unanimity.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Even while speeches were being delivered, efforts to settle the
difference were being made on the platform, and notes were being
freely exchanged among the leaders for that purpose. Malaviyaji was
leaving no stone unturned to bridge the gulf. Just then Jairamdas
handed over his amendment to me and pleaded in his own sweet manner
to save the delegates from the dilemma of a division. His amendment
appealed to me. Malaviyaji’s eye was already scanning</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
every quarter for a ray of hope. I told him that Jairamdas’s amen-
dment seemed to me to be likely to be acceptable to both the parties.
The Lokamanya, to whom it was next shown, said, ‘If C. R. Das
approves, I will have no objection.’ Deshbandhu at last thawed, and
cast a look towards Sjt. Bepin Chandra Pal for endorsement. Malav-
iyaji was filled with hope. He snatched away the slip of paper
contain- ing the amendment, and before Deshbandhu had even
pron-ounced a definite ‘Yes’ shouted out, ‘Brother delegates,
you will be glad to learn that a compromise has been reached.’ What
followed beggars description. The <i>pandal </i>was rent with the
clapping of hands, and the erstwhile gloomy faces of the audience lit
up with joy.</p>

I must regard my participation in Congress proceedings at Amritsar as
my real entrance into the Congress politics.<font size="1">T1</font><font size="1">
</font>My attendance at the previous Congresses was nothing more
perhaps than an annual renewal of allegiance to the Congress. I never
felt on these occasions that I had any other work cut out for me
except that of a mere private, nor did I desire more.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
My experience of Amritsar had shown that there were one or two things
for which perhaps I had some aptitude and which could be useful to
the Congress. I could already see that the late Lokamanya, the
Deshbandhu, Pandit Motilalji and other leaders were pleased with my
work in connection with the Punjab inquiry. They used to invite me to
their informal gatherings where, as I found, resolutions for the
Subjects Committee were conceived.<font size="1">T2 </font>At these
gatherings only those persons were invited who enjoyed the special
confidence of  the  leaders and whose services were needed by them.
Interlopers also sometimes found their way to these meetings.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
There were, for the coming year, two things which inter- ested me, as
I had some aptitude for them. One of these was the memorial of the
Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The Congress had passed a resolution for
it amid great enthusiasm. A fund of about five lakhs had to be
collected for it. I was appointed one of the trustees. Pandit
Mala-viyaji enjoyed<font size="1">T3 </font>the reputation of being the
prince among</p>

beggars for the public cause. But I knew that I was not far behind
him in that respect. It was whilst I was in South Africa that I
discovered my capacity in this direction. I had not the unrivalled
magic of Malaviyaji for commanding princely donations from the
potentates of India.<font size="1">T4 </font>But I knew that there was
no question of approaching the Rajas and Maharajas for donations for
the Jallianwala Bagh memorial. The main responsibility for the
collection thus fell, as I had expected, on my shoulders. The
generous citizens of Bombay subscribed most liberally, and the
memorial trust has at present a handsome credit balance in the bank.
But the problem that faces the country today is what kind of memorial
to erect on the ground, to sanctify which, Hindus, Mussalmans and
Sikhs mingled their blood. The three<font size="1">T5 </font>com-
munities, instead of being bound in a bond of amity and love, are, to
all appearance, at war with one another, and the nation is at a loss
as to how to utilize the memorial fund.<font size="1">T6</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
My other aptitude which the Congress could utilize was as a
draftsman. The Congress leaders had found that I had a faculty for
condensed<font size="1">T7 </font>expression, which I had acquired by
long practice. The then existing constitution of the Congress was
Gokhale’s legacy. He had framed a few rules which served as a basis
for running  the Congress machinery. The interesting history of the
framing of these rules I had learnt from Gokhale’s own lips. But
everybody had now come to feel that these rules were no longer
adequate for the ever- increasing business of the Congress. The
question had been coming up year after year. The Congress at that
time had practically no mac- hinery functioning during the interval
between session and session, or for dealing with fresh contin-gencies
that might arise in the course of the year. The existing rules
pro-vided for three secretaries, but as a matter of fact only one of
them was a functioning secretary, and even he was not a whole-timer.
How was he, single-handed, to run the Congress office, to think of
the future, or to dis-charge during the current year the obligations
contracted by the Congress in the past? During that year, therefore,
everybody felt that this question would assume all the more
importance. The Congress was too unwieldy a body<font size="1">T8 </font>for
the discussion of public affairs. There was no limit set to the
number of delegates in the Congress or to the number of delegates
that each province could return.<font size="1">T9 </font>Some
improvement upon the existing chaotic condition<font size="1">T10 </font>was
thus felt by everybody to be an imperative necessity. I undertook the
responsibility of framing a cons- titution on one condition. I saw
that there were two leaders, viz., the Lokamanya and the
Deshbandhu<font size="1">T11 </font>who had the greatest hold on the
public. I requested that they, as the representatives of the
people<font size="1">T12 </font>, should be associated with me on the
Committee for framing the const-</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
tution. But since it was obvious that they would not have the time
personally to participate in the constitution-making work, I
sugg-ested that two persons enjoying their confidence should  be 
appo-inted along with me on the Constitution Committee, and that the
number of its personnel should be limited to three. This suggestion
was accepted by the late Lokamanya and the late Deshbandhu, who
suggested the names of Sjts. Kelkar and I. B. Sen respectively as
their proxies. The Constitution Committee could not even once come
together, but we were able to consult with each other by
correspon-dence, and in the end presented a unanimous report<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. I regard this constitution with a certain measure of
pride. I hold that, if we could fully work out this constitution, the
mere fact of working it out would bring us swaraj. With the
assumption of this responsibility I may be said to have made my real
entrance into the Congress politics.</p>

I do not remember to have seen handloom or a spinning-wheel when in
1908<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>I
described it in  <i>Hin</i><i>d </i><i>Swara</i><i>j </i>as the
panacea for the growing pauperism of India. In that book I took it as
understood that anything that helped India to get rid of the grinding
poverty of her masses would in the same process also establish
swaraj. Even in 1915, when I returned to India from South Africa, I
had not actually seen a spinning-wheel. When the Satyagraha Ashram
was founded at Sabarmati, we introduced a few handlooms there. But no
sooner had we done this than we found ourselves up against a
difficulty.<font size="1">T1 </font>All of us belonged either to the
liberal professions or to business; not one of us was an artisan. We
needed a weaving expert to teach us to weave before we could work the
looms. One was at last procured from Palanpur,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">T2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>but he did not communicate to us the whole of his art.
But Maganlal Gandhi was not to be easily baffled. Possessed of a
natural talent for mechanics, he was able fully to master the art
before long, andone after another several new weavers were trained up
in the Ashram.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The object that we set before ourselves was to be able to clothe
ourselves entirely in cloth manufactured by our own hands. We
therefore forthwith discarded the use of mill-woven cloth, and all
the members of the Ashram resolved to wear hand-woven cloth made from

only. The adoption of this practice brought us a</p>

world of experience. It enabled us to know, from direct contact, the
conditions of life among the weavers, the extent of their production,
the handicaps in the way of their obtaining their yarn supply, the
way in which they were being made victims of fraud, and, lastly,
their ever- growing indebtedness. We were not in a position
immediately to manufacture all the cloth for our needs. The
alternative therefore was to get our cloth supply from handloom
weavers. But  ready-made cloth from Indian mill-yarn was not easily
obtainable either from the cloth-dealers or from the weavers
themselves. All the fine cloth woven by the weavers was from foreign
yarn, since Indian mills did not spin fine counts. Even today the
outturn of higher counts by Indian mills is very limited, whilst
highest counts they cannot spin at all. It was after the greatest
effort that we were at last able to find some weavers who
condescended to weave swadeshi yarn for us, and only on condition
that the Ashram would take up all the cloth that they might produce.
By thus adopting cloth woven from mill-yarn as our wear, and
propagating it among our friends, we made ourselves voluntary agents
of the Indian spinning mills. This in its turn brought us into
contact with the mills, and enabled us to know something about their
management and their handicaps. We saw that the aim of the mills was
more and more to weave the yarn spun by them; their co-operation with
the handloom weaver was not willing, but unavoidable and temporary.
We became impatient to be able to spin our own yarn. It was clear
that, until we could do this ourselves, dependence on the mills would
remain. We did not feel that we could render any service to the
country by continuing as agents of Indian spinning mills.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
No end of difficulties again faced us.<font size="1">T4 </font>We could
get neither spinning-wheel nor a spinner to teach us how to spin. We
were employing some wheels for filling pearns and bobbins for weaving
in the Ashram. But we had no idea that these could be used as
spinning- wheels. Once Kalidas Jhaveri discovered a woman who, he
said, would demonstrate to us how spinning was done. We sent to her a
member of the Ashram who was known for his great versatility in
learning new things. But even he returned without wresting the secret
of the art.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
So the time passed on, and my impatience grew with the time. I plied
every chance visitor to the Ashram who was likely to possess some
information about handspinning with questions about the art. But the
art being confined to women and having been all but exterminated,<font size="1">T5
</font>if there was some stray spinner still surviving in some
obscure corner, only a member of that sex was likely to find out her
whereabouts.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In the year 1917 I was taken by my Gujarati friends to preside at the
Broach Educational Conference. It was here that I discovered</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
that remarkable lady Gangabehn Majmudar. She was a widow, but her
enterprising spirit knew no bounds. Her education, in the accepted
sense of the term, was not much. But in courage and common sense she
easily surpassed the general run of our educated women. She had
already got rid of the curse of untouchability, and fearlessly moved
among and served the suppressed classes. She had means of her own,
and her needs were few. She had a well seasoned constitution, and
went about everywhere without an escort. She felt quite at home on
horseback. I came to know her more intimately at the Godhra
Conference. To her I poured out my grief about the charkha, and she
lightened my burden by a promise to prosecute an earnest and
incessant search for the spinning-wheel.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
At last, after no end of wandering in Gujarat, Gangabehn found the
spinning-wheel in Vijapur in the Baroda State. Quite a number of
people there had spinning-wheels in their homes, but had long since
consigned them to the lofts as useless lumber. They expressed to
Gangabehn their readiness to resume spinning, if someone promised to
provide them with a regular supply of slivers, and to buy the yarn
spun by them. Gangabehn communicated the joyful news to me. The
providing of slivers was found to be difficult task. On my mentioning
the thing to the late Umar Sobani, he solved the difficulty by imme-
diately undertaking to send a sufficient supply of slivers from his
mill.  I sent to Gangabehn the slivers received from Umar Sobani, and
soon yarn began to pour in at such a rate that it became quite a
problem how to cope with it.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Umar Sobani’s generosity was great, but still one could not go
on taking advantage of it for ever. I felt ill at ease, conti-
nuously receiving slivers from him.<font size="1">T1 </font>Moreover,
it seemed to me to be funda- mentally wrong to use mill-slivers. If
one could use mill-slivers, why not use mill-yarn as well ? Surely no
mills supplied slivers to the ancients ? How did they make their
slivers then ? With these thoughts in my mind<font size="1">T2 </font>I
suggested to Gangabehn to find carders who could supply slivers. She
confidently undertook the task. She engaged a carder who was prepared
to card cotton. He demanded thirty-five rupees, if not much more,
per-month. I considered no price too high at the time.<font size="1">T3
</font>She trained a few youngsters to make slivers out of the carded
cotton. I begged for cotton in Bombay.<font size="1">T4 </font>Sjt.
Yashvantprasad Desai at once responded. Gangabehn’s enterprise thus
prospered beyond expecta-tions.<font size="1">T5 </font>She found out<font size="1">T6
</font>weavers to weave the yarn that was spun in Vijapur, and soon
Vijapur khadi gained a name for itself.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
While these developments were taking place in Vijapur, the spin-
ning-wheel gained a rapid footing in the Ashram. Maganlal Gandhi, by
bringing to bear all his splendid mechanical talent on the wheel,
made many improvements in it, and wheels and their<font size="1">T7
</font>accessories began to be manufactured at the Ashram. The first
piece of khadi manufactured in the Ashram cost 17 annas per yard. I
did not hesitate to commend this very coarse khadi at that rate to 
friends,  who willingly paid the price.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I was laid up in bed at Bombay. But I was fit enough to make searches
for the wheel there. At last I chanced upon two spinners. They
charged one rupee for a seer of yarn; i.e., 28 <i>tolas </i>or nearly
three quarters of a pound.<font size="1">T8 </font>I was then ignorant
of the economics of khadi. I considered no price too high for
securing hand-spun yarn. On comparing the rates paid by me with those
paid in Vijapur<font size="1">T9 </font>I found that I was being
cheated. The spinners refused to agree to any reduction in their
rates. So I had to dispense with their services. But they served
their purpose. They taught spinning to Shrimatis Avantikabai, Ramibai
Kamdar, the widowed mother of Sjt. Shankarlal Banker and Shrimati
Vasumatibehn.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>The
wheel began merrily to hum in my room, and I may say without
exaggeration that its hum had no small share in restoring me to
health. I am prepared to admit that its effect was more psychological
than physical. But then it only shows how powerfully the physical in
man reacts to the psychological. I too set my hand to the wheel, but
did not do much with it at the time.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
In Bombay, again, the same old problem of obtaining a supply of
hand-made slivers presented itself. A carder twanging his bow used to
pass daily by Sjt. Revashankar’s residence. I sent for him and
learnt that he carded cotton for stuffing mattresses. He agreed to
card cotton for slivers, but demanded a stiff price for it, which,
however, I paid. The yarn thus prepared I disposed of to some
Vaishnava friends for making from it the garlands for the <i>pavitra
</i><i>Ekadashi</i>. Sjt. Shivji started a spinning class in Bombay.
All these experiments involved considerable expenditure. But it was
willingly defrayed by patriotic friends, lovers of the motherland,
who had faith in khadi. The money thus spent, in my humble opinion,
was not wasted. It brought us a rich store of experience, and
revealed to us the possibilities of the spinning-wheel.<font size="1">T10</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
I now grew impatient for the exclusive adoption of khadi for my
dress. My dhoti was still of Indian mill-cloth. The coarse khadi

khadi dhoti of 45 inches width within a month, I would do with

From its very inception the khadi movement, swadeshi move- ment as it
was then called, evoked much criticism from the mill- owners. The
late Umar Sobani, a capable mill-owner himself, not only gave me the
benefit of his own knowledge and experience, but kept me in touch
with the opinion of the other mill-owners as well. The argument
advanced by one of these deeply impressed him. He pressed me to meet
him. I<font size="1">T1 </font>agreed. Mr. Sobani arranged the

‘I knew your believing nature,’ he rejoined; ‘that is why I put

With these words the mill-owner beckoned to his clerk who was
standing by to produce samples of the stuff that was being manu-
factured in his mill.<font size="1">T3 </font>Pointing to it he said :
‘Look at this stuff. This  is the latest variety turned out by our
mill. It is meeting with a widespread demand. We manufacture it from
the waste. Naturally, therefore, it is cheap. We send it as far North
as the valleys of the Himalayas. We have agencies all over the
country, even in places where your voice or your agents can never
reach. You can thus see that we do not stand in need of more
agents.<font size="1">T4 </font>Besides, you ought to know that India’s
production of cloth falls far short of its require- ments. The
question of swadeshi, therefore, largely resolves itself into one of
production. The moment we can increase our production sufficiently,
and improve its quality to the necessary extent, the import of
foreign cloth will automatically cease. My advice to you, therefore,
is not to carry on your agitation on its present lines, but to turn
your attention to the erection of fresh mills. What we need is not
propaganda to inflate demand for our goods, but greater production.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
‘Then, surely, you will bless my effort, if I am already engaged in
that very thing,’ I asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
‘How can that be ?’ he exclaimed, a bit puzzled, ‘but may be,
you are thinking of promoting the establishment of new mills, in
which case you certainly deserve to be congratulated.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
‘I am not doing exactly that,’ I explained, ‘but I am engaged
in the revival of the spinning-wheel.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
‘What is that ?’ he asked, feeling still more at sea.<font size="1">T5
</font>I told him all about the spinning-wheel, and the story of my
long quest after it, and added, ‘I am entirely of your opinion, it
is no use my becoming virtually an agent for the mills. That would do
more harm than good to the country. Our mills will not be in want of
custom for a long time to come.<font size="1">T6 </font>My work should
be, and therefore is, to organize the production of hand-spun cloth,
and to find means for the disposal of the khadi thus produced. I am,
therefore, concentrating my attention on the production of khadi. I
swear by this form of swadeshi, because through it I can provide work
to the semi-starved, semi-employed women of India. My idea is to get
these women to spin yarn, and to clothe the people of India with
khadi woven out of it. I do not know</p>

how far this movement is going to succeed; at present it is only in
the incipient stage. But I have full faith in it. At any rate it can
do no harm. On the contrary to the extent that it can add to the
cloth production of the country be it ever so small, it will
represent so much solid gain. You will thus perceive that my movement
is free from the evils mentioned by you.’</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
He replied, ‘If you have additional production in view in<font size="1">T7

Whether the spinning-wheel can make headway in this age of power

wish you every success.’</p>

I must not devote any more chapters here to a description of the
further progress of khadi. It would be outside the scope of these
chapters to give a history of my various activities after they came
before the public eye, and I must not attempt it, if only because to
do so would require a treatise on the subject. My object in writing
these chapters is simply to describe how certain things, as it were
spon- taneously, presented themselves to me in the course of my
exper- iments with truth.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.45cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
To resume, then, the story of the non-co-operation movement. Whilst
the powerful Khilafat agitation set up by the Ali Brothers was in
full progress, I had long discussions on the subject with the late
Maulana Abdul Bari and the other <i>ulemas</i>, especially, with
regard to the extent to which a Mussalman could observe the rule of
non- violence. In the end they all agreed that Islam did not forbid
its followers from following non-violence as a policy<font size="1">T2</font>,
and further, that, while they were pledged to that policy, they were
bound faithfully to carry it out. At last the non-co-operation
resolution was moved in the Khilafat conference, and carried after
prolonged deliberations. I have a vivid recollection how once at
Allahabad a committtee sat all night deliberating upon the subject.
In the beginning the late Hakim Saheb was sceptical as to the
practicability of non-violent non-co-operation. But after his
scepticism was overcome he threw himself into it heart and soul, and
his help proved invaluable to the movement.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
Next, the non-co-operation resolution was moved by me at the Gujarat
Political Conference that was held shortly afterwards. The
preliminary contention raised by the opposition was that it was not
competent to a provincial conference to adopt a resolution in advance
of the Congress. As against this, I suggested that the restriction
could apply only to a backward movement; but as for going forward,
the subordinate organizations were not only fully competent, but were
in duty bound to do so, if they had in them the necessary grit and</p>

confidence. No permision, I argued, was needed to try to enhance the
prestige of the parent institution, provided one did it at one’s
own risk.<font size="1">T3 </font>The proposition was then discussed on
its merits, the debate being marked by its keenness no less than the
atmosphere of ‘sweet reasonableness’ in which it was conducted.
On the ballot being taken the resolution was declared carried by an
overwhelming majority. The successful passage of the resolution was
due not a little to the personality of Sjt. Vallabhbhai and Abbas
Tyabji. The latter was the president, and his leanings were all in
favour of the non-co-operation resolution.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The All-India Congress Committee resolved to hold a special session
of the Congress in September 1920 at Calcutta to deliberate on this
question. Preparations were made for it on a large scale. Lala Lajpat
Rai was elected President. Congress and Khilafat specials were run to
Calcutta from Bombay. At Calcutta there was a mammoth gathering of
delegates and visitors.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
At the request of Maulana Shaukat Ali I prepared a draft of the
non-co-operation resolution in the train. Up to this time I had more
or less avoided the use of the word non-violent in my drafts. I
invariably made use of this word in my speeches. My vocabulary on the
subject was still in process of formation.<font size="1">T4 </font>I
found that I could not bring home my meaning to purely Muslim
audiences with the help of the Sanskrit equivalent for non-violent. I
therefore asked Maulana Abul Kalam Azad to give me some other
equivalent for it. He suggested the word <i>ba-aman</i>; similarly
for non-co-operation he  suggested  the phrase <i>tark-i-mavalat</i>.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Thus, while I was still busy devising suitable Hindi, Gujarati and
Urdu phraseology for non-co-operation, I was called upon to frame the
non-co-operation resolution for that eventful Congress. In the
original draft the word ‘non-violent’ had been left out by me. I
had handed over the draft to Maulana Shaukat Ali who was travelling
in the same compartment, without noticing the omission. During  the
night I discovered the error. In the morning I sent Mahadev with the
message that the omission should be made good before the draft was
sent to the Press. But I have an impression that the draft was
printed before the insertion could be made. The Subjects Committee
was to have met the same evening. I had therefore to make the
necessary correction in the printed copies of the draft. I afterwards
saw that there would have been great difficulty, had I not been ready
with my draft.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
None the less my plight was pitiable indeed. I was absolutely at sea
as to who would support the resolution and who would oppose it. Nor
had I any idea as to the attitude that Lalaji would adopt. I only</p>

saw an imposing phalanx of veteran warriors assembled for the fray at
Calcutta,<font size="1">T5 </font>Dr. Besant, Pandit Malaviyaji, Sjt.
Vijayaraghavachari, Pandit Motilalji and the Deshbandhu being some of
them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
In my resolution non-operation was postulated only with a view to
obtaining redress of the Punjab and the Khilafat wrongs. That,
however, did not appeal to Sjt. Vijayaraghavachari. ‘If non- co-
operation was to be declared, why should it be with reference to
particular wrongs? The absence of swaraj was the biggest wrong that
the country was labouring under; it should be against that that non-
co-operation should be directed,’ he argued. Pandit Motilalji also
wanted the demand for swaraj to be included in the resolution. I
readily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the demand for
swaraj in my resolution, which was passed after an exhaustive,
serious and somewhat stormy discussion.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
Motilalji was the first to join the movement. I still remember the
sweet discussion that I had with him on the resolution. He suggested
some changes in its phraseology which I adopted. He undertook to win
the Deshbandhu for the movement. The Deshbandhu’s heart was
inclined towards it, but he felt sceptical as to the capacity of the
people to carry out the programme. It was only at the Nagpur Congress
that he and Lalaji accepted it whole-heartedly.</p>

I felt the loss of the late Lokamanya very deeply at the special</p>

session. It has been my firm faith to this day that, had the
Lokamanya been then alive, he would have given his benedictions to me
on that occasion. But even if it had been otherwise, and he had
opposed the movement, I should still have esteemed his opposition as
a privilege and an education for myself. We had our differences of
opinion always, but they never led to bitterness. He always allowed
me to believe that the ties between us were of the closest. Even as I
write these lines, the circumstances of his death stand forth vividly
before my mind’s eye. It was about the hour of midnight, when
Patwardhan, who was then working with me, conveyed over the telephone
the news of his death. I was at that time surrounded by my
companions. Spontaneously the exclamation escaped my lips, ‘My
strongest bulwark is gone.’ The non-co-operation movement was then
in full swing, and I was eagerly looking forward to encouragement and
inspiration from him. What his attitude would have been with regard
to the final phase of non-co-operation will always be a matter of
speculation, and an idle one at that. But this much is certain—that
the deep void left by his death weighed heavily upon everybody
present at Calcutta. Everyone felt the absence of his counsels in
that hour of</p>

The resolutions adopted at the Calcutta special session of the
Congress were to be confirmed at its annual session at Nagpur. Here
again, as at Calcutta there was a great rush of visitors and
delegates. The number of delegates in the Congress had not been
limited yet. As a result, so far as I can remember, the figure on
this occasion reached about fourteen thousand. Lalaji pressed for a
slight amendment to the clause about the boycott of schools, which I
accepted. Similarly some amendments were made at the instance of the
Deshbandhu, after which the non-co-operation resolution<font size="1">T1</font><font size="1">

The resolution regarding the revision of the Congress consti- tution
too was to be taken up at this session of the Congress. The sub-
committee’s draft was presented at the Calcutta special session.
The matter had therefore been thoroughly ventilated and thrashed out.
At the Nagpur session, where it came up for final disposal,<font size="1">T2
</font>Sjt. C. Vijayaraghavachari was the President. The Subjects
Committee passed the draft with only one important change. In my
draft the number of delegates had been fixed, I think, at 1,500; the
Subjects Committee substituted in its place the figure 6,000. In my
opinion this increase was the result of hasty judgment, and
experience of all these years has only confirmed me in my view. I
hold it to be an utter delusion to believe that a large number of
delegates is in any way a help to the better conduct of the business,
or that it safeguards the principle of democracy. Fifteen hundred
delegates, jealous of the interest of the people, broad-minded and
truthful, would any day be a better safeguard for democracy than six
thousand irresponsible men chosen anyhow. To safeguard democracy the
people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect and their
oneness, and  should  insist upon choosing as their representatives
only such persons as are good and true. But obsessed with the idea of
numbers as the Subjects Committee was, it would have liked to go even
beyond the figure of six thousand. The limit of six thousand was
therefore in the nature of  a compromise.</p>

The question of the goal of the congress formed a subject for keen
discussion. In the constitution that I had presented, the goal of the
Congress was the attainment of swaraj within the British Empire if
pos-sible and without if necessary. A party in the Congress wanted to
limit the goal to swaraj within the British Empire only. Its

was put forth by Pandit Malaviyaji and Mr. Jinnah. But they were not
able to get many votes. Again the draft constitution provided that
the means for the attainment were to be peaceful and legitimate. This
condition too came in for opposition, it being contended that there
should be no restriction upon the means to be adopted. But the
Congress adopted the original draft after an instructive and frank
discussion. I am of opinion that, if this constitution had been
worked out by the people honestly, intelligently and zealously, it
would have become a potent instrument of mass education, and the very
process of working it out would have brought us swaraj. But a
discussion of the theme would be irrelevant here.</p>

Resolutions about Hindu-Muslim unity, the removal of untouchability
and khadi too were passed in this Congress, and since then the Hindu
members of the Congress have taken upon themselves the responsilibity
of ridding Hinduism of the curse of untouchability, and the Congress
has established a living bond of relationship with‘skeletons’ of
India through khadi. The adoption of non-co- operation for the sake
of the Khilafat was itself a  great  practical attempt made by the
Congress to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity.</p>

set about describing my experiments further. And this I may not do,
at any rate for the present, if only from a sense of propriety.
Lastly, my conclusions from my current experiments can hardly as yet
be regarded as decisive. It therefore seems to me to be my plain<font size="1">T4
</font>duty to close this narrative here. In fact, my pen
instinctively  refuses  to proceed further.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
It is not without a wrench that I have to take leave of the reader. 
I set a high value on my experiments. I do not know whether I have
been able to do justice to them. I can only say that I have spared no
pains to give a faithful narrative. To describe truth, as it has
appeared to me, and in the exact manner in which I have arrived at
it, has been my ceaseless effort. The exercise has given me ineffable
mental peace, because, it has been my fond hope that it might bring
faith in Truth and Ahimsa to waverers.<font size="1">T5</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
My uniform experience has convinced me that there is no other God
than Truth. And if every page of these chapters does not  proclaim to
the reader that the only means for the realization of Truth is
Ahimsa, I shall deem all my labour in writing these chapters to have
been in vain. And, even though my efforts in this behalf may prove
fruitless, let the readers know that the vehicle, not the great
principle, is at fault.<font size="1">T6 </font>After all, however
sincere my strivings after Ahimsa may have been, they have still been
imperfect and inadequate. The little fleeting glimpses, therefore,
that I have been able to have of Truth can hardly convey an idea of
the indescribable lustre of Truth, a million times more intense than
that of the sun we daily see with our eyes. In fact what I have
caught is only the faintest glimmer of that mighty effulgence. But
this much I can say with assurance, as a result of all my
experiments, that a perfect vision of Truth can only follow a
complete realization of Ahimsa.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.44cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
To see the universal and all-pervading Spirit of Truth face to face
one must be able to love the meanest of creation as oneself. And  a
man who aspires after that cannot afford to keep out of any field of
life. That is why my devotion to Truth has drawn me into the field of
politics; and I can say without the slightest hesitation, and yet in
all humility, that those who say that religion has nothing to do with
politics do not know what religion means.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Identification with everything that lives is impossible without
self-purification; without self-purification the observance of the
law of Ahimsa must remain an empty dream. God can never be realized
by one who is not pure of heart. Self-purification therefore must
mean purification in all the walks of life.<font size="1">T7 </font>And
purification being highly</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="western" style="margin-right: 1.57cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
infectious, purification of oneself necessarily leads to the
purification of one’s surroundings.<font size="1">T8</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
But<font size="1">T9 </font>the path of self-purification is hard and
steep. To attain to perfect purity one has to become absolutely
passion-free in thought, speech and action; to rise above the
opposing currents of love and hatred, attachment and repulsion. I
know that I have not in me as yet that triple purity, in spite of
constant ceaseless striving for it. That is why the world’s praise
fails to move me, indeed it very often stings me. To conquer the
subtle passions seems to me to be harder far than the physical
conquest of the world by the force of arms. Ever since<font size="1">T10</font><font size="1">
</font>my return to India I have had experiences of the dormant
passions lying hidden within me. The knowledge of them has made me
feel humiliated though not defeated. The experiences and experiments
have sustained me and given me great joy.<font size="1">T11 </font>But
I know that I have still before me a difficult path to traverse. I
must reduce myself to zero. So long as a man does not of his own free
will put himself last among his fellow creatures, there is no
salvation for him. Ahimsa is the farthest limit of humility.<font size="1">T12</font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 1.46cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
In bidding farewell to the reader, for the time being at any rate, I
ask him to join with me in prayer to the God of Truth that He may
grant me the boon of Ahimsa in mind, word and deed.<font size="1">T13</font></p>
