In what form it is now intended to introduce legislation, it is
difficult to say, but seeing that before it can even be introduced
Mr. Lytteltonâs consent is necessary, I trust that you will
approach him and discuss the question with him, for, after he has
given his sanction to a prticular course, it would be very difficult
to get redress.</p>

What I venture to suggest is that the law 3 of 1885 should be
entirely repealed as also the town regulations regarding foot-paths
and other laws specially disqualifying Asiatics; that an Immigration
Act on the Cape lines should be introduced but so as not to taboo, in
the educational test the Indian languages and; [that] a Dealersâ
Licenses Act should be introduced on the Natal lines provided that
the right of appeal to the Supreme Court be granted against decisions
of the local authorities on licensing applications and provided that
the existing licenses are not touched by it except in so far as the
shops may not be in accordance with sanitary or ornamental
requirements.</p>

Thus, the great bogey of immigration will be set at rest once and for
all, and there would be no question of undue competition in trade.
The local authorities will be able to regulate the number of
licenses.</p>

The British Indians at Heidelberg did well in presenting a loyal
address to His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of the Transvaal,
and in doing so to draw His Excellencyâs attention to the recently
decided test case. It drew from His Excellency an important prono-
uncement on Government policy. The answer given by Sir Arthur Lawley
to the deputation was elaborated in his speech at Volksrust at the
banquet given in his honour by the people of Volksrust. His</p>

Excellency paid a well-deserved compliment to the loyalty of the
Indian people and their industrious habits. Dealing with the[ir]
status in the Transvaal, His Excellency was very guarded. He said 
that nothing could be done by the Government until sanction was
received from the Colonial Secretary. But he had no hesitation in
saying that he sympathised very much with the desire of the white
inhabitants not to be nonplussed by the Asiatic traders, and he
promised the Volksrust people that he would do his best to further
the desire of his fellow- countrymen, though the promise was
qualified by statement that the Government would have to act with
strict justice; that it would have to protect vested interests and
accurately define the position of those who are already settled in
the Colony, and would also have to state what disqualifications those
who might enter the country in future would labour under. All this is
eminently satisfactory. Anything would be welcome to replace the
present uncertainty, and if a just interpretation is given to the
term âvested interestsâ, those who are already carrying on
business in the Transvaal need not have any anxiety. Unfortu- nately,
however, the past does not inspire hope for the future. The ill-
fated Asiatics Tradersâ Commission has made it clear as to what the
Government means by âvested interests.â It would only respect the
trade of those British Indians who were actually carrying on trade
outside Locations in the Transvaal âat, and immediately before, the
outbreak of warâ. We know what this means, and we know how the
Commissioners interpreted the expression. It would only protect a
dozen Asiatics who, leaving their trade intact at the time of war,
went away from the country owing to fear. And if such is the
interpretation to be placed upon the term âvested interestsâ, in
the expressive words of the Chief Justice of the Transvaal, the
Government would again be taking away with the other hand what it
professed to give with the one hand. The danger has been foreshadowed
by His Excellency himself in stating that the Government would
protect the trade of British Indians only during the lifetime of the
present licence-holders. A man engaged in trade knows what this
means. Certainty is very essential in all commercial transactions and
seeing that life is very fickle, would there be merchants found who
would give any credit whatsoever to British Indian traders when the
law informs them that the traders who ask for credit have no security
of tenure, and that on their deaths their businesses would be
abruptly closed? How such a doctrine can be reconciled with strict
justice which His Excellency would dole out to the Indians, it is
difficult to understand. We have, therefore, reluctantly to take the
intentions of the Government to do justice with a great deal of
reserve and caution. Nor do the opinions His Excellency has formed
regarding the effect of Indian trade on the</p>

white trade afford any ground for consolation. We respectfully
protest against His Excellency talking of the great influx of
Asiatics when he must be well aware with what rigidity the Peace
Preservation Ordina- nce is being used as a handle to keep out of the
Colony even British Indians. When the Chinese Importation Ordinance
was passing thro- ugh the Legislative Council, it became necessary
for the Government to shew that the Peace Preservation Ordinance was
being effectively used in order to keep out all but <i>bona-fide
</i>Asiatic refugees. A report was prepared by the Chief Secretary
for Permits which shewed that hardly any new-comer was allowed to
enter the Colony, and that permits were only sparingly granted even
to refugees. It, therefore, seems rather hard and inconsistent that
His Excellency should now  talk about the great influx of Asiatics.
His Excellency said that</p>

it does from the Lieutenant-Governor; but is it true? Is there any
department of trade or commerce in which the Asiatic has ousted the
white man? There are only two branches in which there is any compe-
tition between the two, namely hawking and petty shop-keeping. Now,
the facts as to hawking are that white men, except of a particular
class, simply would not condescend to do the onerous work. As has
been shown by our contemporary <i>The </i><i>Star</i>, many an
attempt has been made by the white hawkers, but each time they have
given it up, not because of the Indian competition, but because they
do not care for it. But there is a class of white men who are
carrying it on successfully and against the Indians. We refer to the
Syrians and Russian Jews. They are industrious, do not mind walking
great distances with  a heavy load on them, and we see them doing
that business successfully. Moreover it should not be forgotten that,
in hawking about towns, the Indians supplies a felt want and does a
double good. He brings to the very door of the householder vegetables
and other things, and enables the wholesale merchants to make easy
profits out of the Indains. It is because he has been found to be so
profitable that wholesale Euro- pean houses have invariably supplied
him. If they suspended credit to the Indian, he would be thoroughly
impossible in South Africa as a hawker. And what we have said with
reference to the hawker applies more strongly to the petty
shop-keeper. In fact, beyond  Johannes-</p>

is not to be found. And there is a keen competition between  the
European petty shop-keeper and the Indian in which the former
invariably has advantage over the latter. But when these two trades
are excepted, there is absolutely no competition whatsoever between
the two races. In the Cape Colony, for instance, where competition is
absolutely free and the Indian has almost all the rights, he has not
been able to oust any white store-keepers. Nor has he been able to do
so in Natal, where there is such a large Indian population. The
statements, therefore, that the Indian ousts the white man in trade,
with due deference to His Excellency, is hardly fair, except to an
extremely limited extent. And even where the Indian may seem to oust
the white man, he only raises him a step above himself (the Indian) 
by becoming a middleman and making him a wholesale dealer instead of
a retail trader.</p>

But the speech made by His Excellency just shows how much work there
is yet to be done before the Indians in the Transvaal will be in a
position to retain any hold of the trade which ought to be theirs as
a matter of right by reason of the decision in the test case.</p>

There has been so much said with reference to the licensing test case
in the Transvaal and we, on our part, have had so much to say
regarding it, that we have not been able to overtake and deal with
the different cuttings which lie before us. One, however, from among
them we must hasten to single out, for it is very typical of the
temper of the East Randites. It grieves us, however, to find that our
contemporary, <i>The </i><i>East Rand </i><i>Express</i>, has
associated itself with  a most dangerous doctrine, and, although it
is vey cautiously stated in the issue of the 14th instant, reading
between the lines, the conclusion is irresistible that veiled advice
has been given to the East Rand people to take the law into their own
hands and prevent by force the opening of any Indian stores within
that district, should such an attempt be made. Such tactics and such
methods are unworthy of people who call themselves British and of
British journalism. Our contemporary would be selling for a mess of
pottage all that is held sacred by British communities if, in a
moment of irritation, it descends to a level so low. We would allow
our contemporary to speak for itself and leave the</p>

Either writing such as this conveys an empty threat, in which case
our contemporary has misjudged the Indian entirely, or it is seri-
ously meant. In the latter event, for the sake of the Indians, apart
from any Imperial considerations, we would welcome a hanging or two
by the people in the East Rand, should an Indian open a store. It
would at once bring up the whole question to the surface and enable
the Indians to know whether the flag which has hitherto been found to
afford perfect protection for physical liberty is still sufficient or
not. It would also shew whether the Indian is cowardly enough to be
staggered by any such proceedings, and skulk away from the country.
So far, therefore, as the Indian himself is concerned, his position,
we doubt not, will be infinitely strengthened if the East Rand
community accept the advice of our contemporary. We may, however,
remind it of  a parallel  that    happened at Umtali some years ago<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

population turned out and threatened to burn down the store and to
wreak dire vengeance on the Indian himself, if he would not close his
store. Fortunately, single-handed as he was, he defied the crowd,
refused to close the store or to run away. In the meanwhile, police
assistance came, and the crowd, finding itself checkmated, withdrew,
leaving the Indian to carry on his trade peacefully. We present this
incident to our contemporary for reflection, and ask once more
whether the office of respectable journalism is to provoke breaches
of law or to inculcate order and good behaviour in the community in
whose interest it is published.</p>

At the same time that Mr. McLartyâs motion was carried, Mr. Dan
Taylor, to the astonishment of all, made a very energetic speech,
notifying that he would move heaven and earth to see that Chinamen
were introduced into Natal in lieu of the Indians. Mr. Dan Taylor of
1896<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was quite different form Mr. Dan Taylor of today.  He
was then an arch agitator against Coloured labour in any shape or
form. He inveighed against the planters and was determined to throw 
the  Indians, who had then just arrived from India, overboard if they
claimed the right to land on the Natal shore.  All this is history.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>But
manners change with the times and so do men, and Mr. Dan Taylor now
thinks that some Coloured labour is absolutely essential for the
prosperity of the Colony. And if he can carry his proposal, we would
certainly suggest that a vote of thanks be given to him by the Indian
community. He is against Indian labour because he finds that the
Indian Government will not allow the Indian to be worked as a slave
to the extent that would satisfy him. We are against Indian labour
under indenture because we consider that the form under which the
Indian is imported into the Colony is, in the words of the late Sir
William Wilson Hunter, perilously near to slavery. We can never
reconcile ourselves to the Capitation Tax of Â£ 3 annually which is
the price that the law exacts from the Indian for his freedom, a
freedom which, in the words of the late Mr. Escombe, is granted to
him after he has given the best five years of his life to the Colony
for a paltry wage.</p>

Though, therefore, it is from different points of view, it is great
satis- faction to us that we find ourselves in perfect agreement with
Mr. Dan Taylor, and we shall certainly hail the day when Indian
indentured labour under present circumstances is stopped. It would,
moreover, open the eyes of the Colonists to the real benefit that the
presence even of the free Indian has contributed to the prosperity of
the Colony. It is all very well to inveigh against the Indians
getting a bit of freehold land, but the gentlemen who cry out against
this entirely forget that every bit of land that passes into Indian
hands is turned into a veritable garden. What possible objection
there could be to the Indian turning to good purpose the land that
the European would not touch, we cannot understand. However, the
proof of the pudding is in the eating, and if Mr. Dan Taylor succeeds
in stopping Indian immi- gration, what we have now been stating as an
opinion will become a realised fact in a very short time after the
prohibition of indentured labour from India.</p>

subscriptions for a memorial for the late Sir John. This is as it
should be if only because he was the first Prime Minister of the 
Colony under responsible Government, and because he was the prime
mover in bringing about responsible Government for the Colony. His
claim, however, to public recognition is far greater because of his
devotion and self-sacrifice towards the promotion of the public weal.
The late Sir John was entirely a self-made man. His work as a
journalist is well known to everyone and as an educationist, he was
probably second to none in South Africa. With him, journalism was not
a matter of pounds, shillings and pence; he used it as a vehicle for
educating public opinion, imparting a healthy tone to the community.
In fact, he used his great talents not for intellectual pleasure but
for the sake of the country. As a public speaker, too, he was second
only perhaps to the late Mr. Escombe in eloquence, though perhaps his
style was more polished than that of the latter. We hope that the
Indian community will associate itself with the movement to
perpetuate the memory of the deceased statesman. He has a claim on
the attention  of the Indians from a special point of view, and here
we may</p>

gratefully recall the occasion when the late Sir John undertook, at
much inconvenience to himself owing to his ill-health, to preside at
the meeting held by the Indians to celebrate the relief of Ladysmith,
Mafeking and Kimberley.  His speech delivered at the time<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

the work of the Indians at the time of the war. It shewed on his part
a large-hearted sympathy. It also shewed that he, for one, was not
infected with the current prejudice.</p>

We have received from the Protector of Indian Immigrants a copy of
his annual report for the year ended 31st December 1903. The
indentured Indian population of the Colony, including the descendants
of such Indians, at the end of the year, was 81,390 as against 31,712
in the year 1896, and 78,004 in the year 1902. The birth rate for the
past year was 32.11, and the death rate 20.78. The lowest death rate
was in the year 1898, namely, 14.30, and, curiously enough, the same
year shews the lowest birth rate, namely, 19.09. Plague claimed 52
victims during the year under review; pneumonia and other lung
complaints 328 and phthisis 262. These figures are rather disquieting
and require careful investigation. As has been remarked in the
report, in the Coal Mines the death rate among the Indians has been
rather high. Of 40 deaths occuring among the small number of Indians
within the mining circle, 16 died from phthisis and 8 from pneumonia,
and it is to be hoped that the Protector will not rest content until
the mortality has been considerably reduced. 1,053 marriages were
registered at the Protectorâs office last year of which 2 were
polygamous. The savings of the 2,029 Indians who returned to India
last year amounted, in cash and jewellery, to Â£ 34,690, that is to
say, a little over Â£ 17 per head. Herein there is a conclusive
argument against the notion often put forth that the Indians could
very well return to India and live on their earnings for the rest of
their lives without having to do anything, or could utilise the
savings otherwise so as to enable them to earn a decent living. Now,
even in a poverty- stricken place like India, it could not seriously
be contended that Â£17 could go a great length in supporting a man.
Of the 2,029 returned Indians, 1,542 were Madrasees and 487 Calcutta
men.  The savings of</p>

the Madrasees amounted to Â£27,417 <font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>that

the Calcutta men amounted to Â£ 7,273<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>that
is, Â£15 per head. There is an interesting classification given by
the Protector of the savings of the Immigrants. 47 Madrasees had
above 2,000 rupees each as against 5 Calcutta men. 25 Madrasees had
under 2,000 as against 6 Calcutta men. 22 Madrasees had under 50
rupees as against 11 Calcutta men. And so, throughout, the Calcutta
man has come out extremely badly. It shows that he is not so
industrious or so thrifty as the Madrasee, and it would be well if
our Calcutta friends would take note of this important fact, and
those who have influence inculcate among them the necessity for
greater prudence. Of the  81,390 Indians, 30,131 were under
indenture; the balance had become free. Under the heading âEmployer
and Employeesâ, we are told that the relations, generally speaking,
between employer and indentured Indi- ans have been good, and as a
consequence the Indians are well treated.</p>

New rules have been framed with reference to the Indians who may be
desirous of going to the Protector for making complaints; whereas,
formerly, the Indian was free from arrest if he could shew that he
was proceeding to the Protector for the sake of laying a complaint
before him, under the new rules, he would not be free unless he
possessed a pass to that effect from the Magistrate of his division
which may or may not be granted. Thus, really speaking, he has to
establish a <i>prima facie </i>case before the Magistrate in order to
enable him to proceed to the Protector's office. We cannot help
remarking that this is an innovation which was hardly necessary. It
would have been far better if the freedom of the Indian had been
unrestricted with reference to any complaints he might have to make.
No doubt there would be a few frivolous complaints, but we think it
is better to overlook them than that those who have <i>bonafide </i>comp-
laints should have any difficulties placed in their way.</p>

The demand for Indian labour seems to be increasing at an alarming
rate. There were, at the end of the year, 15,033 applications undealt
with. The agent in India is utterly unable to cope with this
extraordinary demand. It shews that the Colony simply cannot do
without indentured Indian Labour, and yet we hear men crying out
against it, and arguing that the Colony has been ruined by indentured
Indian labour.</p>

We have given the remarks of the Protector on this painful subject in
full, and we cannot help expressing our surprise that it has been
dismissed so light-heartedly. Suicides among the indentured Indians
have become a feature year after year, and we think that the cause
ought to be probed to the bottom. And it is hardly an answer coming
from the Protector of Indians that he cannot arrive at even a
probable cause if those who are supposed to know decline to give any
information. There is a homely English proverb, âWhere there's a
will, there's a way,â and if the Protector would only feel as we
feel, having the powers of an autocrat, he should have not the
slightest difficulty in tracing the cause. There is enough in the
Protector's statement to shew that there must be something wrong. Out
of the free Indian popula- tion 51,259, there were 8 suicides. Out of
30,131 indentured Indians, there were 23. Why this great
disproportion? Now, the highest rate is to be found in Paris<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>namely,
422 per million<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>and Paris is
considered to be most notorious in this respect. But the rate among
the indentured Indians comes to 741 per million. These figures are
sufficient to give cause for very serious reflection. We think that
the information given in the report on the subject is exceedingly
meagre. There should be a statement shewing which estate shews the
highest number, and there should be a summary at least as to the
nature of evidence given, etc., at the Magisterial enquiries. We do
not wish to draw any conclusions against the employers from these
staggering figures, but we do plead for a thorough enquiry, alike in
the interests of the Indians as of the employers, and we consider
that nothing short of an impartial commission to investigate the
cause would meet the ends of justice. And an ideal commission ought
to include a medical</p>

gentleman of good standing, a nominee of the Immigration Board, the
Protector, and, if it is not a sacrilege to make the suggestion, an
Indian of standing in the Colony. Such a commission cannot but result
in arriving at the truth. The greater the light thrown on the
subject, the better it would be for all concerned, and we hope that

It seems that the Government and the Pretoria Town Council have the
knack of disagreeing on all important matters, in each case the
Council being hopelessly in the wrong. Then latest instance is in
connection with its very constitution. The Council is powerless to do
much work for the rate-payers unless it allows itself to come under
Ordinance 58 of 1903, regulating Municipal Corporations, but the
Council is unwilling to do so unless, in the words of Mr. Van
Boescht- en, a Councillor, âit receives the power to force Coloured
people to keep off the foot-pathsâ, which power is not reserved by
the Ordin- ance in question. The Government, therefore, has notified
the Council that is must either decide to come under the Ordinance or
not at all, as the matter has been hanging fire now for several
months, pointing out to the Council that,</p>

resolution that âthe Council will be prepared to come under
Ordinance 58 of 1903 after the Traffic Bye-Laws regarding sidewalks
have been passedâ. This is nothing less than a challenge thrown
down by the Council. If it were not for the fact that the party
opposing is the Council of the Metropolis of the Transvaal, the
action would be considered to be very churlish. On the one hand,
there is the question of the legal existence of the Council, and as
the Assistant Colonial Secretary to the local Government states, a
loss to the extent of several thousands of pounds per annum to the
rate-payers; on the other, that of excluding Coloured persons from
using the foot-paths. An ordi- nary business Corporation would have,
at any rate, first of all secured the ample powers in virtue of the
Ordinance and then, if it was considered necessary, set about
insisting on getting its Foot-path Bye- Laws. The Pretoria Town
Council has, however, reversed the order, and like the baby in the
tub, it would not be happy till it has got the power to prohibit
Coloured people from using the foot-paths. We shall watch with
interest the development of the struggle between the Government and
the Council.</p>

He would thus have the conditions which existed as regarded the
Indians in pre-war days remain âunchanged, inviolable and sacredâ.
Will he, therefore, be kind enough to ask the Government to allow the
Indians to trade anywhere they like without licenses as they did
before war and to enter the Colony absolutely without restriction? We
would also ask him to quote figures to shew how much drain has been
caused by the Indians in the country, and if we may take the liberty
of informing him, it may be stated that most of the takings of the

European landlords. To say that he has brought nothing but disease to
the country in the face of the revelations about the neglect of the

 the  suburbs  of veracityâ,  and,  after  all,  barring  the 
plague,  Mr. Loveday point out any other disease with which the
Indian is at all connected? Take, for instance, the enteric fever
which is, according to Dr. Turner, far more deadly and far more
infectious than the plague. Is it not a fact that the Indian is
particularly free from this disease and that the mortality and the
infection are mostly restricted to the Europeans? Would the
honourable member, therefore, shut out European immigration from
Europe? However, it is no use arguing with a person who simply does
not want to be convinced, and if we have taken the trouble to discuss
Mr. Lovedayâs views on the Indian ques-tion, it is because we are
anxious that those who may see his speech may not be misled by what
he has stated with reference to the econo-mic drain and the plague.</p>

The people of Volksrust are very much agitated over the decision of
the Supreme Court in the Indian Licensing test case. We are told that
they met on the 27th May last, at Abnerthy Hall, that âthe meeting
was a gigantic success, and that the hall was crowdedâ. They have
passed a string of resolutions, very drastic in their nature,</p>

one of which calls upon âthe whole country to establish a
referendum to the people, giving them the opportunity to assert their
opposition to the introduction and settlement of the Indian trade in
this countryâ, and calls upon the people of Volksrust not to,
either directly or indirectly, encourage Indian trade. With all this
we cannot quarrel; it is perfectly constitutional, and if there is a
general boycott instituted, the Indians cannot complain. The
agitation, however, seems to be utterly insincere in that the
agitators have absolutely no confidence in their ability to carry out
the programme, for in the same breath as they propose a wholesale
boycott, they also call upon the Government to introduce legislation
depriving the Indians of the right which the Supreme Court had
decided they have under the law of the country. Mr. Fisher, the
chairman of the Urban Board, suggested that, âpen- ding
legislation, by hook or by crook, they must tide over the next few
monthsâ. We do not know what the phrase means, but we can only say
that, if it implies departure from constitutional methods, with all
deference, it is unworthy of the gentleman occupying the responsible
position that Mr. Fisher does, and we hope that the Government will
take note of the undeserved difficulties that surround the position
of the Indian in the Transvaal.</p>

This evidently shews that the Town Council has at present no
intention whatsoever of complying with the requirements of the
Expropriation Ordinance, whereby it is bound to provide for the men
dispossessed from the expropriation area, accommodation in the
neighbourhood thereof. The sixteen hundred Indians who were sent from
the Indian Location to Klipspruit are still without suitable</p>

and have to be satisfied with enforced idleness. Those have been
allowed to return to town are obliged to pay enormous rents for the
privilege of living in Johan-nesburg, simply because the  Town 
Council has failed to carry out its legal duty. But apart from this
consideration, if the powers above mentioned are granted to the Town
Council by the Legislative Cou-ncil, it would mean a very serious
matter for the British Indians, and it would also be a very great
step in advance of the old Republican legislation against the
Indians, for, as matters stand at present, the Town Councils have no
control whatsoever, except in matters of sani-tation, over Indian
Bazaars or Locations. The power of fixing these sites rests in the
Government and the Government alone, and the people have the right,
at any  rate within the restricted area, to own fixed property and to
build their own dwellings. If the intention of the Town Council is
carried out, Indians will be placed on the same level with the
Natives, and will be totally at the mercy of the Town Council. They
would be merely tenants-at-will and be subject to cons-tant removal.
There would be an end then to any ownership of land in the Locations.
Such a state of things is too dreadful to contemplate, and were it
not for the fact that the local Government has shown itself unable to
protect the weaker party, we would decline to believe that it is at
all possible for the Town Council to get the powers it would like to
possess in connection with the British Indians. We can only hope that
the members of the Council will remember the pre-war days, their
promises when they were Uitlanders to the British Indians, and as
honourable men do their duty  by fulfilling them.</p>

Mr. Moor, the Assistant Colonial Secretary, has replied to the East
Rand Vigilants Association, saying that the Government is seriously
considering a change in the existing legislation affecting the
Asiatics, namely, Law 3 of 1885, as amended in 1886. We are aware

the matter. Mr. Lyttelton has shown himself to be strong-willed in
more matters than one. He has not hesitated to disregard the demand
of the mining people in Rhodesia for introduction of Chinese labour
until the Legislative Council of that portion of South Africa has
declared its view in the matter. Again, he has not hesitated to defy
the strong public opinion in England, as well as in other parts of
British Dominions, against such introduction in the Transvaal
because, rightly or wrongly, he has made up his mind that it is good
for the country, and that it is favoured by the people in the
Transvaal. Will he hold his own with regard to the Indian legislation
in the Transvaal? He has assured Sir Mancherjee Bhownaggree that he
will give the matter his most careful consideration. The question of
Chinese introduction is hardly an Imperial question. It does not
affect the status of British subjects. But the Indian question has
been acknowledged to be an Imperial one, and also very important.
Much has been said and much has been written on it. The opinion
outside South Africa is overwhe- lmingly in favour of the British
Indian claim. The Imperial Govern- ment is, moreover, tied down to a
policy favourable to the British Indians since the time of the
Republican regime. It  fought  the Indiansâ battle when Mr. Kruger
reigned in Pretoria. Its represen- tatives deliber-ately stated that
the grievances of the British Indians in the Transvaal were one of
the causes of war. There is in all this much to guide Mr. Lyttelton
aright. He is bound as an Imperialist to protect Indian interests. He
is further bound by the promises made to the British Indians by his
predecessors, and we can only hope that any new legisl-ation that is
framed to replace Law 3 of 1885 will be in consonance with the
Imperial spirit and the promises.</p>

vested in the Municipality of East London. The British Indians at the
Cape do not seem to have noticed them, and we fear that they have,
therefore, passed unchallenged. Nor need such an omission excite any
surprise, because it is too much to expect a trading community to
wade through Government Gazettes. And we are not aware of the whole
of the Bill in its passage through the Cape Parliament having been
published in any of the important local newspapers. But what shall we
say of the Government which gives such drastic powers to a
Municipality, or of the Colonial Office which advises His Majesty the
King to sanction such legislation, for, being class legislation, it
evidently required the Royal assent before being proclaimed Law of
the Country? We have said so much in dealing with similar legisla-
tion for East London that we do not consider it necessary to offer
any comments upon its application to the Uitenhage Municipality. We,
however, hope that our remarks will attract the attention of the
friends of British Indians in London as well as in India and the
authorities, and that some relief will be granted.</p>

We note also that the Chinese Ordinance has been reserved for special
assent. We do not know why this Bill should not have been likewise
reserved, especially as it applies to all Asiatics, whether British
subjects or not. Or, is it that the sections we have referred to
escaped the Governorâs notice as well as that of the Colonial
Office? And if so, it shews that there is a necessity for some power
in the Letters Patent whereby all class legislation would be invalid
unless it is embodied in a separate Act dealing with such
differential legislation and that alone.</p>

Mr. Hyslop asked the Colonial Secretary whether he would not replace
Indian Interpreters by European, as he had been informed that the
former did not give satisfaction. The Colonial Secretary agreed with
the honourable member but said that there were difficulties in
obtaining Europeans, and added that at the Umgeni Court an Indian was
superseded because a European was found.</p>

This incident teaches a moral. The Indian Interpreters are tolerated
only because Europeans are not be found in the Colony having even a
smattering of the Indian languages, and it will be as well if the
Indian Interpreters throughout the Colony will take note of the fact.
The Government evidently would have no hesitation  in summarily
dismissing them if non-Indians could be found to take their place. We
cannot, however, help protesting against the charge brought against a
body of most industrious civil servants by Mr. Hyslop, namely, that
they do not give satisfaction. On the contrary, we would very much
like the honourable member, in justice to the men he has maligned, to
give the source of his information. We have no hesitation in saying
that, if they do not give satisfaction, it is a scandal which the
Government should remove at the earliest opportunity. On the other
hand, if they are competent, industrious and honest, the fact should
be recognised and they should be absolved from the charge. As a
matter of fact, we have seen the testimonials of not a few of these
Interpreters who have simply made themselves indispensable to their
superiors, not only by giving complete satisfaction in the discharge
of their own work, but by taking over the clerical and other work
which they are not in any way obliged to do. Mr. Hyslop could hardly
know that the Indian Interpreters labour under a very great
disadvantage in that they are called upon not only to interpret in
one of the Indian languages but, as a rule, in three, and it is a
well known fact that, if you want first-class Interpreters, you
cannot combine a knowledge of four languages in one. It is also
notorious how badly paid the Interpreters are. To say the least of
it, therefore, it would have been graceful if Mr. Hyslop had not
brought the charge against them, but simply contented himself by
advancing the interests of his clients, against which we should have
had nothing to say.</p>

Our contemporary, <i>The </i><i>Natal Mercury</i>, which as a rule is
well informed in all it has to say, has been misinformed with
reference to its comparison between the Chinese Ordinance of the
Transvaal and the Ordinance in force in Trinidad and British Guiana,
regulating the introduction of indentured labour. Our contemporary is
perhaps led into making the mistake, because, for political reasons,
Mr. Balfour has seen fit to draw a parallel between the British
Guiana Ordinance and the Chinese Ordinance, and we may state, for the
information of those that argue so, that there is as much difference
between the two as there is between black and white. The British
Guiana Ordinance does not deprive the indentured man of the use of
his intelligence. It does not insist upon the indentured labourer
leaving the country on the termination of his indenture, nor does it
reduce the immigrant merely to the status of an unskilled labourer by
prohibiting him from doing anything else, or by prohibiting others
from making use of him as anything else than an unskilled labourer.
There is, moreover, no Com- pound  System<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>as
 is  to  be  enforced  against  the  Chinese,  and   the labourer in
British Guiana is free to settle in the country after the termination
of his indenture and work as an independent man. Not so the Chinese.
We wonder whether, in spite of all these fundamental differences
between the two, our contemporary would still hold that the only
difference is âthat some political partisans denounce as slavery in
the Transvaal a system which is regarded complacently as indentured
labour in other Coloniesâ.</p>

Here, then, there is an unblushing distinction drawn based absolutely
on colour and that of a most drastic character. It goes, we make bold
to say, even so far as to admit of temporary slavery, if en- forced
service be accepted as such. The price of staying in the Muni-
cipality of Winburg is service under a white master. The regulations,
it will be noticed, make no exception in favour of British subjects
or in favour of Coloured persons of standing. Indeed, they recognise
no standing for Coloured persons. We have more than once reproduced

Orange River Colony. We have protested in vain against them, and
somehow or other nothing has been done even in  London.  The Letters
Patent have provided against any such legislation, except with the
consent of the Colonial Office, but although one would have thought
that the greater would include the less, there appears to be no
safeguard against municipal legislation of the character above
descri- bed, and it seems to be hopeless to expect the local
Government to veto such legislation. We hope the regulations will
attract the attention of the Colonial Office, and that at any rate a
pronouncement will be made on the anti-Coloured policy that is being
followed under the British flag and in the name of the King-Emperor
in the Orange River Colony.</p>

We have here a corroboration from the highest authority in the
Transvaal of what we have all along been saying, namely, that the
Peace Preservation Ordinance is being used for purposes for which it
was never intended. And His Excellency is evidently delighted that he
has got such an instrument in his hands for preventing the immi-
gration of âfloods of undesirables, some of them European, but most
of them Asiaticâ, and His Lordship does not know what the lives of
the people in the Colony would be worth if the weapon were to be
given up. If such remarks had proceeded from a demagogue, we would
have understood them, but coming as they do from the head of the
State, and one, moreover, who is believed to be one of the</p>

foremost states-men in the British Empire and an out-and-out
Imperialist, they fill one with pain and dismay. In the first
instance, to talk of floods of under-sirables is an exaggeration
unworthy of His Lordship, and, in the second place, to state that, in
the absence of the weapon, the lives of the people in the Colony
would not be worth anything is to make a confession of utter
weakness. And, after all, is the country so much over-populated? Have
the lives of the people at the Cape or Natal, or any other British
Dominion for that matter, become worthless because they do not
possess the engine which has been used by His Lordship in the
Transvaal? True, for a few years in Natal, and for one year at the
Cape, an Immigration Restriction Law has been in force, but it is
nothing compared to the Peace Preservation Ordinance of the
Transvaal, under which even <i>bonafide </i>refugees find it most
difficult to gain entrance into the Colony, though they may be
British subjects, men of standing, and having large stakes in the
Transvaal. And if the remarks which fell from His Lordship represent
his sober views on immigra-tion, it foreshadows an exceedingly poor
outlook for the British Indians in the Transvaal. We hope, however,
that His Lordship has per-mitted himself to make the above remarks in
order to enliven the very prosaic proceedings of the Council and to
put the refractory members, who have been handling the different
departments rather roughly, in good humour, for we notice that His
Lordshipâs remarks about the weapon were received with laughter.</p>

We make no apology for reverting to the question of suicides among
the indentured Indians in Natal, which we raised in our issue of the
4th instant<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>.  We feel sorry that, with the exception of  <i>The 
</i><i>Natal </i><i>Mercury</i>, the other dailies have not taken the
matter up, which  is  purely and simply one of humanity in which
they, as public journals, cannot but be interested. Our desire in
asking for a commission is simply to elicit the truth, and we cannot
help feeling that even the employers themselves, if they would look
at the matter dispassionately, should welcome the appointment of a
commission of enquiry. If an impartial commission comes to the
conclusion that they (the employ- ers) are in no way responsible for
the terrible number of suicides that are committed annually among the
indentured Indians, it would be a great relief to them and to the
public generally. If, on the other hand, there is anything that they
can do which would prevent the unnatural mortality, it would be an
advance in the right direction as well for themselves as for the
unfortunate men who are working under inden- ture. This is not a
subject which, in a British Colony, can be dismissed with a few lines
of lame explanation betraying an attitude of hopeless- ness. We have
not the slightest doubt that there must be a remedy for the evil, if
only it is sought after earnestly and in the right spirit. We,</p>

following the British Indian position in South Africa. He never
misses an opportunity of making a point whenever one is to be made,
and the manner in which he goes about his business has so
recom-mended itself to the ministers concerned that they give him, as
a rule, as ample information as is possible under the circumstances,
and often meet his questions in a sympathetic spirit. May he have a
long life and may he continue to honour the House of Commons by his
presence and to serve his countrymen is the earnest prayer of every

Martizburg under this Act, and both of them were against British
Indians. We give the full report of the proceedings in another
column. The case of Dayal Ooka appears to us to be very hard. We
would not offer any lengthy remarks, seeing that an appeal has been
noted. The facts, however, so far as the evidence enables us to see,
are that the defendant has lived in the Colony over five years, and
that he paid Â£8 to somebody on board the steamer before he could
land on his return from India. Against this evidence, there was
nothing produced by the prosecution, but the Magistrate would not
believe the testimony given by the accused and sentenced him to
imprisonment for two months, unless the deportation of the accused
could be arranged to take place before. If, therefore, the decision
of the Magistrate is upheld, it would appear that every British
Indian will be presumed to be a new-comer, unless he can prove, not
only on oath himself, but by some other testimony, that he has been
in the Colony before the passing of the Act. If such a view is taken,
no Indianâs position in the Colony will be secure. However, we must
postpone further remarks on these extraor- dinary prosecutions until
the appeal is decided. For the present, we would content ourselves
with appealing to the Government to stay these prosecutions, because
it is its duty to prevent the surreptitious entry of prohibited
immigrants into the Colony, but, in our humble opinion, it would be
going altogether too far to molest the people who are already in the
Colony, and who have landed in spite of the preca- utions taken by
the officers appointed under the Immigration Restric- tion Act, even
though they may labour under the restriction as to former domicile.</p>

We produce elsewhere further correspondence between the Government
and the Pretoria Municipality on the question of the foot-path
bye-laws. The Government is to be congratulated upon the firm stand
it has taken in the matter, and it is impossible not to admire the
tenacity with which the Pretoria Municipality is also fighting the
Government. The pity of it is that the tenacity is being shown by the
Municipality of the metropolis of the Transvaal in what would appear
to any common-sense man to be a discredited and unworthy cause. It
could not seriously be argued that any question of principle is at
stake in allowing Coloured people to walk on the foot-paths. The
Munici- pality surely would not thereby be assenting to the 
principle of equality between the two races in other respects. That
is a big question and could be kept absolutely separate from the
foot-path question. The Mayor of Pretoria evidently now sees that the
Municipality is making itself a laughing-stock by persisting in its
opposition to the Government, but the other Councillors, led by Mr.
Loveday, would not listen to his arguments, and have sent a letter to
the Government asking it to give them a special ordinance like the
Johannesburg Municipality. It is an interesting duel that is going on
between the Government and the Council. We can only hope that the
Govern- ment will stick to the principle laid down by it and not
yield at the eleventh hour to the dictation of the Municipality.</p>

We sincerely congratulate the Government on bringing in the Bill to
regulate the signing of negotiable instruments by Indians. It is an
earnest of their solicitude for their well-being. Within our experi-
ence, there have been cases of gross fraud, not necessarily between
Indians and Indians, but even on the part of some Europeans, perpe-
trated owing to the inability of the Indians to sign such promissory
notes in English characters. Very often, such notes are made without
the contents being known to the maker; and the Bill in question is
undoubtedly calculated to be a great relief to innocent people. To
put the finishing touch to the Bill, may we suggest that it would be
better if the thumb-impression were also insisted upon? It has been
found</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always"><a name="25. FOOT-PATHS IN THE TRANSVAAL"></a>
that it is impossible to forge a thumb-mark, and the thumb-impression
would be the surest safeguard against impersonation, for  it  may
happen that the man who may put his mark before a Magistrate or a
Justice of the Peace may not at all be the person intended to be
charged with the debt. Promissory notes will derive very great weight
being made before a Magistrate or a Justice of the Peace, and if
there has been any impersonation, it will be very difficult to prove
it. Nor will it be fair to expect the Magistrates or Justices of the
Peace always to scrutinise the identity of the persons appearing
before them to make promissory notes. We hope, therefore, that the
Government would be pleased to embody our suggestion in their Bill
and make it complete and really effective.</p>

To a certain extent, it is difficult to withhold sympathy from the
Boksburg Council. They do not want to see any Coloured people on
their foot-paths. Johannesburg possesses the right to prevent all
Colo-ured people from using them; why should, then, the other Town
Councils not be placed on the same footing as Johannesburg? The
position appears to be logical enough. What has happened is this:
Johannesburg, having got a constitution of its own, does not need to
come under the General Corporations Ordinance, and in the special
Ordinance for Johannesburg, the draftsman omitted to deal with the
town regulations of the old regime. When, however, later, the Munici-
pal Corporations Ordinance was passed, the matter was effectively
dealt with by giving a proper definition to the term âNativeâ.
The bolder and honester policy would certainly have been for the
Govern- ment to delete from the Statute-book that portion of the
regulation which unnecessarily subjects Coloured people other than
Natives to the indignity; but the straight course having been rightly
or wrongly abandoned, the Town Councils in the Transvaal, who feel
aggrieved that they have been taken unawares, are now, naturally from
their own standpoint, agitating against it. It is no doubt a
difficult position. The only reasonable solution seems to be that
Johannesburg ought to be placed on the same footing as the other Town
Councils in this matter. Then full justice will be done and the other
Town Councils will have to rest content with the powers they have
got. It, however, does seem strange and somewhat painful that
influential and important bodies like the Town Councils of the
Transvaal should make a mountain out of a mole hill, and take
pleasure in the unnecessary heaping of insult</p>

upon insult on people who have done no harm to them and who, if
anything, have deserved well, for, leaving aside for the present the
British Indians out of consideration, it must not be forgotten that
hun- dreds of Cape Coloured people were used by the erstwhile
Uitlanders, now gentlemen of the Town Councils, for their own
benefit. They we- re fondled; the British flag was constantly dangled
before their eyes; its protective power was eloquently placed before
them so that they might rush into their arms, make affidavits
regarding the <i>zulum</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 
 </font></sup>of the Boer Authorities, and make common cause with
them, so that the han- ds of the Colonial Office might be forced and
pressure put upon Mr. Kruger. Surely, these men have a right at least
to walk without moles- tation on the side-walks of any street in the
Transvaal, towards the upkeep of which, like other rate-payers, they
contribute their quota.</p>

The debate on Mr. Bourkeâs motion in the Legislative Council of the
Transvaal, calling upon the Government to pass legislation
restricting the liberty of the Indians, took place on Tuesday evening
last. The usual platitudes were uttered by the honourable gentleman.
The prospective ruin of the petty white trader was dangled before the
members. The right of the Transvaal to pass any legislation in the
matter was insisted upon, while statements were made as to the entry
of Indians into the country. But Mr. Hosken as also Dr. Turner were
able to shew completely that Mr. Bourke was hopelessly out of date as
to his statements. Mr. Hosken shewed from figures that the Indian has
been, and continues to remain, a blessing to Natal, which owes its
pros- perity to his presence. Dr. Turner, in reply to a violent
attack on the Indian on the part of another member about the
so-called insanitary habits of the Indians, was able to shew
conclusively that the authorities alone were to blame with reference
to the condition of the now burned down Indian Location in
Johannesburg. The community should feel very grateful to the worthy
Doctor for not hesitating to utter the truth, and  for  thus 
defending   the   Indian   from   undeserved   attacks. Mr. Duncan
shewed conclusively that the Indians had been allowed to enter the
Transvaal most sparingly, and that, with the exception of four, all
were <i>bona-fide </i>refugees. Mr. Duncan, however, has assured the
House of his sympathy, and has promised to bring the whole matter
before the Colonial Office. Mr. Solomonâs amendment was ultimately
accepted shewing satisfaction at the assurance given by the</p>

Mr. Lyttelton has, to our utter astonishment, if the cable report is
correct, told Sir Mancherjee Bhownaggree that the rate of suicides
among the indentured Indians is not great and that, consequently, he
would not institute an enquiry.</p>

According to the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>: âIts existence is
rightly looked upon as a sign of the presence of maladies in the
body- politic which, whether remediable or not, deserves careful
considera- tionâ. So even apart from the question of the largeness
of the number of deaths from suicide, it is a matter which requires
investigation. Even the Protector of Immigrants in his report does
not go as far as Mr. Lyttelton; he considers the death-rate to be
sufficiently great to dese- rve more than a passing mention.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.27cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But let us compare statistics. Out of the free Indian population of
51,259, there were eight suicides. Out of the 30,131 indentured
Indians, there were twenty-three. This by itself ought to make one
pause. According to the table given in <i>Encyclopaedia </i><i>Britannica</i>,
Saxony had the highest rate, namely, 371 per million in 1882. The
rate amongst the indentured Indians is 741 per million. Does not this
great disparity between the highest figures on the  continent  and
among the indentured Indians in Natal require some consideration? And
yet, as we have repeated before, for the present  we  blame nobody;
we have suspended judgment. Probably the cause is simple, and capable
of an easy explanation. All we demand, with the greatest deference to
Mr. Lyttelton, is that the matter should be probed to the bottom and
cleared up in the interests of justice and humanity. We hope,
therefore, that Sir Mancherjee having taken it up will not allow it 
to slide down, but persist in his enquiry.</p>

The Transvaal <i>Government Gazette </i>for the 1st July contains a

of the Ordinance:</p>

So far the restriction has applied to gold-mining, and with reference
to that we have said nothing; but now it will be unlawful for an
Indian even to make bricks, for he could not get a license to do so.
Mr. Lyttelton, in answer to Sir Mancherjee Bhownaggree, only a few
days ago, assured the honourable gentleman that the rights of the
British Indians already settled in the Colony would be fully
protected. The draft Ordinance before us does not appear to carry out
the intention. May we, therefore, take it for granted that the
Ordinance will be altered by the Government, or, if it is passed in
its present form, vetoed by Mr. Lyttelton?</p>

The plague has served as a peg in the Transvaal on which to hang many
a disability on the British Indians. The latest we hear is that,
under cover of the plague precautions, the issue of permits to
British Indian refugees from all the Colonies in South Africa has
been stopped, and the only reason, so it would appear, is that
plague-  infected rats have been found in some localities in
Johannesburg, and that, too, not in Indian quarters, but in poor
European quarters. The stoppage of the permits was resumed after the
appearance of a plague case or two in Durban, but seeing that the
plague  has  suddenly stopped in Durban, some excuse was necessary,
and the plague rats have been pressed into service. We do not know
what the intentions of the Transvaal Government are, but if the
policy of slow torture is to be reproduced in the proposed
legislation, the condition of the British Indians in the Transvaal
will be simply pitiable. In this connection, it may be as well to
reproduce a paragraph from Dr. Murisonâs report on the health of
the borough to show on what flimsy pretext the permits from Durban
were stopped.</p>

Ex-President Kruger is no more, and in him one of the most striking
personalities of the nineteenth century has passed away, leaving the
world the poorer for it. His was a strong character which had,
perhaps, many contradictions, but the net result was undoubtedly in
his favour. His devotion to those whom he was proud to call his
people was unexampled, and even the mistake that he made in defying a
powerful nation like the British and in sending his world-famous
ultimatum is a mistake that would count, not against him, but in his
favour. It was his intense love for the country and its people that
made him take the fatal step. There was no vainglory about it. He
felt that he was in the right. His faith in the Old Testament
teaching  was sublime, and he believed that God was on his side and,
that being so, he could never lose. Indeed, even after the issue was
finally decided, during the short period that he was on this earth,
he never allowed himself to waver and still continued, as many Boers
do, to believe that good for them will yet come out of the British
annexation. And so it undoubtedly will; not perhaps in the manner
they would wish, but then Godâs ways are not our ways, and the
future will shew what the destiny of the nation is to be. It has
often been urged that the deceas- ed Presidentâs flight from
Pretoria was due to cowardice. We have</p>

never, however, brought ourselves to accept the charge. He considered
that he could best serve his countrymen by remaining away and
managing affairs from a distance and he went. To think that the brave
man who, when he was wounded by a tiger, with his own hand cut off a
finger and dressed the wound and went about his business as if
nothing had happened, would be the man to fly from a post of danger
is a mistaken idea. His demeanour, too, on the Continent was worthy
of a great and godly man. He shewed no undue irritation, resigned
himself to the inevitable, and ever continued to guide his people by
his advice. The one lesson that he has left behind him is his single-
minded, though at times misguided, patriotism, and we venture to 
think that it will be as a staunch patriot that he will be best known
to posterity. The British Indians personally have very little to
thank the deceased statesman for. We are yet smarting under his
legislation in the Transvaal, but that need not prevent our
countrymen from recog- nising his great virtues, and in joining those
who are sorrowing for the death of so great a man.</p>

Boksburg merchants continue their activity against trade licenses
being granted to British Indians and other Asiatics. They have
addressed a manifesto to all the Chambers of  Commerce  in  the
Colony with a view to united action being taken. Most extravagant
statements are made in the documents that percolate through Boks-
burg. For instance, the other Chambers are calmly told that
âinjustice and danger are being inflicted on the white community by
allowing unrestricted Asiatic trade to obtain a footing in the
Colonyâ. The sug- gested resolution, if listened to, would simply
make the Legislative Council look ridiculous in the eyes of the
world, for the resolution gravely asks the Council to âsuspend the
issue of licenses to Asiatics, pending the bringing into force of a
permanent law governing Asiaticsâ.Yet we are told that they have
succeeded so well in combi- ning that not a single Chinaman has been
able so far to obtain a footing near the Chinese compound. Why
should, then, there be any indecent haste one fails to understand,
but we have it on the authority of our contemporary, <i>The Star</i>,
that it is essential that such forcible agitation should take place
in order to strengthen the hands of the local Government in its
representations to the Colonial Office. Read</p>

in that light, we understand what all this means: it is nothing less
than intimidation. The people say in effect to the Imperial
Government that, âif you do not grant us what we want, we will
quarrel with youâ, for it is stated that âa further resolution is
to be moved to the effect that, if the Imperial Government will not
grant consent, an agitation for responsible Government be commenced
in order that the Trans- vaal may secure the right to control its own
internal affairsâ. It is quite clear that, so long as the Goverment
continues to fence with the ques-tion and, instead of doing perfect
justice, thinks of pleasing both the parties, such unhealthy and
udesirable agitation retarding the establi-shment of peace between
European British subjects and Asiatic British subjects will continue.</p>

The fight over the Chinese trade which was inevitable has commenced
in all earnestness and bitterness. The Boksburg people are up in arms
against the very idea of the Chinese store-keepers having any
dealings with their indentured countrymen. It is  not enough that
they are to be themselves deprived of all the civil rights and to be
reduced to serfdom; it is not enough that they are to get<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>as
a Chinaman told <i>The </i><i>Star </i>interviewer<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>wages
so little that they would leave very little savings, although the
prospect before them at the end of the indenture is that they must
return to China. The European store-keeper in Boksburg must, in
addition, derive exorbitant profits also from the Chinese trade, and
whatever the indentured men may have to spend out of their wages must
go into the pockets of the European store-keepers. Then, indeed,
would the gentlemen in Boksburg consider that some small measure of
justice has been done to them, otherwise the Chinese labourers need
not have come at all. And if the Chinese store-keepers are allowed to
supply the necessaries to their countrymen, it would be the height of
injustice and a depri- vation of the rights of the European
store-keepers. They confess their utter inability to compete with the
Chinese store-keeper. In naked language, it means that they would
want to charge the poor slaves far more than the Chinese
store-keepers would ever think of doing. And so they are
concentrating all their energy, influence and power in preventing a
single Chinese trader, or, for that matter, an Indian trader, from
having any share in the Chinese custom. They have petitioned</p>

the Lieutenant-Governor, they have called upon all the Chambers of
Commerce to join them in the combination and in creating a trust<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>in
the Chinese trade in their favour. They have  been  saying pretty
plainly that, if the Government does not come to their assistance,
they will take the law into their own hands and, by hook or by crook,
prevent a single Chinese store-keeper from having a footing in Boks-
burg. This shows the temper of the community, and it shows also to
what length they are prepared to go in order to assert or, shall we
say, usurp the rights which do not exclusively belong to them. Like 
spoiled and petted children, having so far had their own way, they
have overstepped all bounds and simply consider that it is their
right to dictate terms to the Government on any question they like.

This was too much for a few of the sober-minded who attended the
meeting, and among them we were pleased to notice Mr. Constable of
<i>The </i><i>East Rand Express</i>. Violently hostile, as we venture
to think, he has been to the Asiatic, to his constitutional instinct
the resolution appeared to be very obnoxious, and he moved that
âevery possible <i>constitutional </i>means,â [be substituted for
âevery possible meansâ] and that the clause as to total
prohibition be erased. The voices of Mr. Constable and his supporters
were voices in the wilderness and reason had to give place to passion

As we have often said, if the gentlemen of Boksburg consider that by
unmanly threats they will be able to intimidate a single British
Indian wishing to assert his right, they are much mistaken, and we
refer them once more to the Durban incident as well as the incident
at Umtali.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>In Durban, the ultimatum of  the  self-styled 
Demonstrative Committee was powerless to intimidate the Indians into
returning to where they came from, and a mob in Umtali was unable to
coerce the single inoffensive Indian trader into leaving his store.
He defied them to do their worst and stood his ground until police
assistance came and the Superintendent of Police discharged the
crowd.</p>

What, however, came from the Mayor of Boksburg, when he persuaded the
meeting to drop the intimidation of the Government covered by a
resolution for the early introduction of Responsible Government, was
far more ominous. The Mayor made it quite clear to the meeting that
Mr. Duncan, the Colonial Secretary, was working hand in glove with
them. We do not wish to put our own views, because we do not wish to
do even an unconscious injustice to the Colonial Secretary. These are

We cannot give stronger or better proof in support of what we said
last week, namely, that the whole of this agitation is being
engineered, and to find that the Colonial Secretary, as representing
the Government, should take up a partial attitude and stand behind
the agitation asking for strength and so on is a humiliating
spectacle. Even the late President Krugerâs Government did not act
so. He did not ask his burghers or the Uitlanders to strengthen his
hands; he fought fairly and squarely. There was nothing behind the
scenes, and the Indians knew what they had to face. As it is, they
have absolutely no notion of what is going on behind the curtain. The
Mayor has only allowed us a peep behind, but that peep is enough to
stagger us and to make us despondent. When all these reports of the
meeting are telegraphed to Mr. Lyttelton, there will be no one to
tell him that these meetings have been practically called forth by
the Government, have been encouraged by it, and that the policy of
the Government is the policy of the meeting. <i>Fiat justitia ruat
</i><i>Coelum </i>has been proclaimed from thousands of British
platforms. The saying will now have to be revised in the Transvaal in
order that it may fit in with the new order of things which has been
established. And read by the light of the remarks made by the Mayor
of Boksburg, we feel that the splendid advocacy by Mr. Duncan of the
Indian traders at the time of the resolution, moved by Sir George
Farrar for the appointment of the Asiatic Tradersâ Commission,
could hardly be considered sincere.</p>

We are now enabled to print in <i>extenso </i>the question put by Sir
Mancherjee, on the point raised in <i>Indian Opinion </i>of the 4th
June last, about the abnormal rate of suicide among indentured

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Mr.
Lyttelton said he had seen the report referred to. The rate per
million among Indians was 382, and not 741, as stated, the rate among
free Indians and indentured Indians being 157 and 766, respectively.
He was informed that a Magisterial inquiry was made into the
circumstances attending each case of suicide, and whenever the
evidence tended to show that the fata- lity in any way resulted from
ill-treatment received from an employer or employee, the Protector of
Indian Immigrants made a personal visit to the estate and inquired
into the circumstances. In one instance, and one only, did the
evidence tend in this direction. Generally speaking, witnesses stated
that they could give no reason for the suicide, and if those who were
supposed to know declined to given any information, it was impossible
in many cases to arrive at even a probable cause. The general rate
among Natal Indians in 1902 appeared to have been 333, and in 1901,
383, so that the rate for the year 1903 was not altogether
exceptional. This rate had been exceeded in Paris.</font></font></p>

Sir Mancherjeeâs figures have been taken from this paper,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
Mr. Lyttelton put into Sir Mancherjeeâs mouth a statement which we
see he has never made, and then denied the authority of his figures.
Sir Mancherjee enquired whether the rate was not 741 per million
among indentured Indians. There is slight error, namely, that Sir
Mancherjee refers to 31 cases. Now the 31 cases are the total number
of suicides, of which 23 were among the indentured Indians, but his
ratio is quite correct. Sir Mancherjeeâs figures, therefore, remain
quite unchallenged and, as the <i>Daily News </i>has pointed out, by
the figures that Mr. Lyttelton himself produced, he has simply given
additional force to the remarks made by the Indian member, for,
according too Mr. Lytteltonâs ratio, the figure is not 741 but 766
as against 157 among free Indians. These are eloquent if also very
painful figures. And in the face of those appalling figures, Mr.
Lyttelton declared himself satisfied with the meagre reference to the
matter in the Protectorâs report, and in so doing, he has, in our
humble opinion, missed the very point we have raised. We do not yet
ascribe the suicide to the ill-treatment received from the employers,
as Mr. Lyttelton has evidently assumed, but we do say that the
condition which causes such a death-rate from self-destruction is
such as to call for an enquiry, in the interests of both the
employers and the employed. We know that the rate is not exceptional
for the year under discussion, but it has been going on from year to
year, and that is the worst of the situation. That is why we consider
it to be high time a full</p>

and impartial enquiry were instituted. It may be that it is the
situation under which the indentured men are placed which is to blame
rather than any actual ill-treatment by the employers. It may be that
the men themselves who are called upon to do the work find it too
trying for them, or that there are climatic conditions which
predispose them to such acts or that it is simply home sickness on
their part. Be the cause whatever it may, it is essential that the
public should know exactly what it is, and that the Indian mind also
which is very much agitated over it should be satisfied on the point.
We cannot, therefore, understand what possible objection there could
be to a reasonable request for an enquiry, except perhaps that of
expense, but we dismiss that from consideration altogether, knowing
as we do, how enquiries after enquiries are granted on much less
important matters, involving a very heavy outlay. We, therefore,
trust that this question will not be allowed to rest, and that it
will be made clear to the Colonial Office by the worthy Knight that
the suggested enquiry does not pre-suppose ill-treatment by the
employers, and that it is not intended to cast the slightest
reflection on them. All that is needed in an investigation into the
truth and no more.</p>

The report of the meeting of the Town Council of Johan- nesburg,
which we give in another column, about the housing of Natives and
Asiatics, is interesting reading. It will be remembered that, during
the plague outbreak, the old Location was burned down and the
inhabitants were removed to Klipspruit Camp. Some members of the
Council were of the opinion that it was a good riddance and thought
that the Camp was a permanent Location. They, however, found that,
after the isolation period had expired, the inmates were allowed to
remove to town, provided they could shew dwellings to the
satisfaction of the Rand Plague Committee. It should also be borne in
mind that the Indians thus dispossessed have nothing at all in the
shape of a piece of land where they could permanently reside. No
Location in place of the one burned down has yet been appointed, and,
not possessing the right to own fixed property, they are obliged to
remain in a state of suspense. The report now shews that the Town
Council does not know its own mind. It is yet as far away from the
choice of a suitable site as it ever was, and the position is that,
in the</p>

crowded Malay Location. Their trade is gone. They  are  without
goods, which have been burnt, and are without compensation. The
position is truly pitiable and not a finger is raised by the Colonial

Mr. Lytteltonâs remarks are cheering; the only question is whe-ther
he will be strong enough to put them into practice and to wit-hstand
the opposition from the local Government. We have all along been
saying that the treatment meted out to the British Indians since the
British occupation is inconsistent with British dignity and British
national honour. We now find the Colonial Secretary endorsing that
view from his seat in the House of Commons. Let us hope that his
deeds will be as good as good as his words.</p>

We have much pleasure in announcing  that the plague restrictions on
the movements of the British Indians within the Transvaal itself,
imposed by the Rand Plague Committee, have been withdrawn, and now
Indians wishing to travel from one place to another in the Colony
would no longer be required to submit to a medical examination and
carry travelling permits. We wish to congra- tulate our countrymen in
the Transvaal on their deliverance, and more so on the exemplary
patience shown by them. We have always held that the restrictions
were totally unnecessary, though we have, at the same time, also
advised that submission was the very best thing that could be done by
them. The plague officially broke out in the middle of March last
and, beyond the first virulent outbreak, it has never raged in a
dangerous form. For the last three months, there have been only
isolated cases, and these confined mostly to the Natives. And yet for
four months and a half, the Indians have laboured under grievous
disadvantages as to their movements. The statistics shew conclusively
that, outside the Indian Location, the plague has been no respecter
of persons,and outside Johannesburg hardly an Indian case had hap-
pened. Some of the districts have been absolutely free from  any 
Indian cases. Moreover, the authorities have not been able to bring a
single complaint against them. They have shown themselves willing and
eager to fall in with the wishes of the authorities, and even when
their houses and effects were burned down, and when they were asked
to go to a camp thirteen miles from the town, they did so without
grumbling. Dr. Turner, the Medical Officer for the Colony, has deli-
berately given it as his opinion that, for the outbreak in the
location in Johannesburg, the Indians were in no way to blame, and
that the authorities, having neglected their first duty as to keeping
the place in a sanitary condition, were responsible for the state of
affairs. Hun- dreds of Indians, who have been rendered homeless and
whose goods have been destroyed, are yet without payment of any
compensation whatsoever or without a fixed abode. We take leave to
say that very few communities are to be found in the world behaving
in the manner in which the Indians have during the trying ordeal, and
under most vexatious difficulties. Will the Government take note of
this? Will the Rand Plague Committee, which has come in close contact
with the people, have the courage to give the Indian his due? Will
Mr. Lyttel- ton take into consideration these facts in approving of
any restrictive</p>

home to the authorities and see that the work so well done is not
wasted away?</p>

The mail papers to hand bring the most gratifying news that the
Honourable Mr. Phirozshah M. Mehta has been knighted. If any man
deserved the honour, it certainly is Sir Phirozshah. He is one of the
oldest public workers. He is the father of the Corporation of Bombay
and probably there is not a single member of that great Corporation
who has attended so many meetings or served the length of time that
Sir Phirozshah has done. He is the uncrowned king of the Bombay
Presidency and is recognised as the first leader as no other man in
any other province in India is. His unrivalled ability and
experience, his eloquence, his tact and unfailing courtesy to his
opponents have ear- ned for him great popularity with the people and
prestige with the Government. He has left his mark on many
legislative enactments of the Bombay Presidency, and, during the
short period that he was enabled to serve the Imperial Legislative
Council at Calcutta, he carved out for himself a unique position. It
is worthy of note that Sir Phiroz- shah had always been associated
with the National Congress and has twice been the President of that
institution. The conferring of the knighthood, therefore, is no less
a compliment to the Congress than to the honourable gentleman
himself. We think that in honouring him the Government has honoured
itself. This is not the first time that a Congress leader has been so
honoured. The Honourable Mr. Gokhale, who, as our readers are aware,
has been doing yeoman service in the Imperial Legislative Council,
has only lately received the distinction of C.I.E., and we note,
among the recent recipients of honour, the Honourable Sankaran Nair.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>All
this shews perhaps the signs of the times, but it shews also that the
Government is fully alive to the good work that is being done for it
by the leaders of the Indian community in different parts of India.</p>

A correspondent named âFairplayâ wrote some time ago to our
contemporary, <i>The Star</i>, in connection with the position of the
British Indians in Lourenco Marques as compared to the[ir] position
in the Transvaal. The correspondent made the Indians in Delagoa Bay
say as follows:</p>

may be news to the writer that an act was crowded out of the last
sitting of the Cortes from want of time, and is to be brought up at
the next sitting, under which newly-arrived Indians are to be taxed
at the rate of Â£80 per head per annum. It is stated that this
measure has the approval of the Government. If the above proposal of
Mr. Deputy Carvalho passes into law, âFairplayâ will find some
other dumping ground than Portuguese territory for his friends.</font></font></p>

Now, if the information given by <i>The Star </i>correspondent be
correct, it shews once more that it is not the Portuguese in Delagoa
Bay who are opposed to the Indians, but that it is the general body
of European merchants, such as the Uitlander class is  composed  of,
which have succeeded in getting round the Portuguese Government, so
that they may be able to get a monopoly in trade. They did not during
the old regime in the Transvaal, and persuaded the late President
Kruger to pass legislation. It has been only recently that a large
Europan population have settled in Delagoa Bay, and we should not be
at all surprised if they have persuaded the Portuguese Government to
place restrictions on British Indians. Mr. Lyttelton will have to be
very careful if he is at all jealous of the rights of the British
Indians in South Africa, and once the Portuguese  Government embarks
upon restrictions on the British Indians, the problem will
undoubtedly be far more complicated, because Delagoa Bay is not a
British Colony, and because the ways of the Portuguese are often
inscrutable.</p>

But the burden of our remarks today will be applied to the little
sentence in the report wherein the Superintendent states  that âwith
Indians, the percentage of women arrested for drunkenness is nineâ.
This is not a new thing but, all the same, it is heart-rending to
think that Indian women, who in their own country have never known
what drink is, should here be found in the streets in a state of
drunkenness. There are undoubtedly cases which are beyond oneâs
control, and much may be urged in extenuation of the weakness of the
fallen women, but we conceive that so long as a single Indian woman
is to be found in the Borough under the influence of drink, it must
reflect upon the Indian community. We have often had  to perform the
duty of urging the rights of the community. It is today our privilege
to draw the attention of the community to a very obvious duty which
it owes to itself and to its womanhood. Personally, we would see it
made criminal for Indian women to be supplied with drink at any of
the bars in town, but it would be far more satisfactory if, so far as
Indian women are concerned, the community could carry on a battle
against the curse, and we have no doubt that success can be easily
attained. There are Indian societies in town, and enough young
Indians with plenty of time at their disposal to carry on the much-
needed temperance work, and here all creeds might usefully join 
hands. We may also appeal to the Reverend Mr. Smith and the Reverend
Father Murray, who have all the facilities at their command and a
suitable organisation to work with. And there are also educated
Indian ladies who could be very helpful in the matter. It ought to be
quite feasible to have small bands visiting each Indian bar and
speak[ing] to the women as well as to the barmen, for we do not see
why even barmen, who are mostly Indians, should not be persuaded to
decline to serve women. We need not go into the merits of the
question, for there can be only one opinion. It is hardly necessary
to point out the awful results that flow from drunkenness, especially
among women. The stamp that the crime (for it is nothing less) leaves
on posterity is often indelible, and it ought to be held as
sufficient to wake up within us unquenchable energy to see the reform
through. We shall be glad if our young readers would ponder over the
suggestion we have ventured to make and take it up without  and
delay.</p>

In another column, we publish a report copied from the <i>Zoutpansberg
</i><i>Review </i><i>and </i><i>Mining </i><i>Journal</i>, dated 29th
July, of the anti-Asiatic meeting held in Pietersburg, which is said
to have been attended by from two hundred to three hundred people.
The main resolution passed was similar to that passed at Boksburg,
and the usual fallacies were dished up with an increasing mixture of
spices in order to render them palatable to the meeting. For
instance, one of the speakers said that the Indians lacked âthe
desirable qualities in residents of townsâ in that they did not
leave âsomething of a lasting and progressive natureâ. Another
speaker said, âThey kept no carr- iages, bought no produce, and
spent no moneyâ, and a third said, âIf an Indian took 5s. in a
daysâ business, he went without  food altogether, and if he took
Â£5, he would kill a fowlâ. These statements are made by people who
would be accepted as sober in ordinary business affairs. To degrade a
class of people with deliberation, to coop them up in pens, to
deprive them of the right of buying land, and then to turn round upon
the very men and charge them with want of qualities desirable in
citizens is a fine game. If any of these worthy speakers have
travelled beyond the boundary of the district of Zoutpansberg, we
might venture to direct their attention to what they, the indians,
have done in the way of progressive citizenship in Cape Town, Durban,
and other places where they are allowed some rights. They have built
business places in each of these towns which would compare favourably
with any, and in building those places, they employed European
architects, European contractors, European builders, bricklayers,
carpenters, etc., and some of these buildings are tenanted also by
Europeans. In one instance, we know a man, a European, who was a
tenant for nearly twenty years. The Indian landlord never increased
the rent during that time. The tenant was reduced to poverty and
could not pay rent, and the generous-minded landlord excused payment
of rent for, we believe, a number of years, and would not take
proceedings for ejectment. This is fact and no fairy tale. We would
be pleased even to give the names of the parties to any <i>bona-fide
</i>enquirer. May we ask whether all this shews lack of good
citizenship? One of the speakers said again that âthe true solution
of the Asiatic question lay in the application of the maxim, âthe
greatest good for the greatest numberââ. We must confess that we
are not blind believers in that maxim; we think that it has worked
untold mischief in many cases, and is yet likely to do so in the
history</p>

of the worldâs progress. But for the sake of argument, assuming its
soundness, let us examine its application. The gentlemen who spoke at
the meeting held briefs for the traders. The crime committed by the
Indian is that he competes with them, he lowers the price of the
neces- saries of life and, having a fund of patience at his command,
is a better seller, especially to those whose pockets are not too
full, whether they be Europeans or Natives. Even then, if the Indian
trader is of any disadvantage to the European trader, which we deny,
he is on the whole of great benefit to the largest number of the
inhabitants of the Transvaal and, in proof of that, the very fact
that he has to depend for his business on the support received from
the poor whites, including the Dutch and the Natives, may be
mentioned without fear of any contradiction. And, strangely enough,
the meeting itself found it necessary to establish a provisional
White League Committee âfor the propose of devising means to
discourage trade with the Asiaticsâ. The drafting of the
constitution has been left in the hands of the Mayor and others. So
then, we have the Local Board taking sides in a ques- tion of this
description. But in arguing about this matter, we know we are beating
the air. To men steeped in prejudice, an appeal to reason is worse
than useless. We can only hope that what reason may not accomplish
will be accomplished by the great healer, Time, and the Indian can
afford to wait, as justice is on his side.</p>

We have to congratulate Mr. Ellis Browne on his re-election as the
Chief Magistrate of the Borough for the third time. In this go- ahead
and daily growing town, consisting as it does of a cosmopolitan
population, having often conflicting interests, the office of Mayor
is no sinecure. In Mr. Ellis Browne we have a gentleman of varied
acquirements and possessing a large amount of industry. So far as the
British Indians are concerned, he knows them well; he has been
brought into frequent personal contact with all classes of the commu-
nity, and but for his notorious minute on the Bazaar question, he was
known to be fair-minded and impartial. That he lost his head, as so
many did, on the Bazaar question is easy of explanation. It was Lord
Milnerâs spell under which he was then labouring. His Excellencyâs
Notice 356 of last year<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

It affirmed the policy of the Government with regard to Indians, and
it meant that His Excellency approved of the old Republican
legislation. Naturally, our worthy Mayor thought that it must have
been sanctio- ned by Downing Street and what could be allowed in a
Crown Colony where, moreover, the very subject-matter of the Notice
was a cause of the war, should a <i>fortiori </i>be permissible in a
self-governing Colony like Natal, and that was the reason why he
hurled his minute at the Indian community. Let us hope, however, that
it is now forgotten, and  if we have rescued it from oblivion it is
to shew that it was a temporary aberration, and by no means
representative of the general attitude of Mr. Ellis Browne. We wish
him further success and prosperity to the Borough during his term of
mayoralty.</p>

The number of <i>India </i>to hand by the last mail shews the peren-
nial activity of Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, the Grand Old Man of India.
Nothing comes to him amiss if it is at all to be of benefit to the
millions of his fellow-countrymen, and the correspondence between Mr.
Lyttelton and himself published in <i>India</i>, and which we
reproduce in another column, on the question of the status of the
British Indians in the Transvaal, is but an instance of his activity.
Many a man at his age would be entitled to retire from public life
and enjoy well-  deserved rest, but Mr. Naoroji, in spite of his age,
can give points to many young workers in the cause. In his
self-imposed exile, the only pleasure he knows is that of doing what
he considers to be his duty by his countrymen. For spotless purity of
life, for utter selflessness, and for sustained public activity
without caring for reward or praise, it will be difficult to find Mr.
Naorojiâs equal, not only in India but, we may say without
exaggeration, in any part of the globe.</p>

	This amendment was opposed by Mr. Brink and, as might be expected,
	was seconded by Mr. Loveday. The honourable gentleman said that the
	old regulations ought not to be tampered with. Now the old town
	regulations prohibit the use of the side-walks by Coloured people
	entirely, and it was said that it was a trespass upon the rights and
	privileges of the people for the Government to make any change
	whatsoever in the old law. The Attorney-General stated that, under
	the old law, a Kaffir even when entering a shop was liable to be
	arrested for being on the foot-path. He also said that it was

letter, and that even during the Republican regime, respectably
dressed Coloured people were not interfered with. To that, we may add
the instance of an Indian who was pushed off the foot-path, and who
approached the then British Agent. The British Agent at once took up
the defence of the Indian and made a strong representation to the
State Secretary, Dr. Leyds, who sent a letter of apology and said
that it was under a mistake and misapprehension that the police
interfered with the Indian who was walking on the foot-path, and he
assured the British Agent that such occurrences would not be
repeated. No protest was made by Mr. Loveday then against such a
relaxation of the law, but now that the Government wishes to
recognise the relaxation, Mr. Loveday an his friends are indignant.
And yet it must be apparent to anybody that the Government amendment
is, although meant to give relief, nothing less than an affront,
because to make distinctions with reference to use of side-walks is
so foreign to British traditions. It can only be in this enlightened
twentieth century, and that in the Trans- vaal, tah in the name of
that Government such a thing is possible. And the proviso as to
[being] ârespectably dressed and of good conductâ, is so elastic
that, under it, unless the police have very special instructions,
much mischief may be done. Even Dr. Turner, official member though he
is, felt that the whole thing was ridiculous, and gave a very apt and
humorous instance of a white man whom he saw outside the Government
Buildings in Pretoria, âswaying to and fro, with his hands in his
pockets and a pipe in his mouth, and spitting all round a clear six
foot circleâ. The question, therefore, is hardly one of colour, but
of hygiene and sanitation. The proper thing would be to punish all
people who soiled the foot-paths, and it provides an intelligible,
safe and inoffensive remedy.</p>

But our contemporary has not a word to say to the Colonists on behalf
of the inhabitants of India who are settled in the Transvaal! Proud
as the descendants of Englishmen are in the Colonies to belong to the
British race, and eager as they are to enjoy the privileges that the
British Empire has to offer them, they would shirk the responsi-
bility that membership of the Empire imposes on them, especially so
far as British India is concerned. They are willing to appropriate
the glory that comes from the British connection with India, and from
a distance to applaud the valour of the Indian soldiers, but when it
comes to a fair treatment of the brethern of these very soldiers,
they want to hold themselves aloof. It is, therefore, a pity that our
contem- porary did not make use of its opportunity, in dealing with
Lord Curzonâs speech, of placing before its numerous readers the
principle of recognising the very elementary and simple duty of <i>quid
</i><i>pro </i><i>quo</i>. As Sir Mancherjee has said, the Colonies
cannot with impunity continue to insult and embitter the feelings of
three hundred millions of inhabitants of India for an indefinite
length of time. Slowly, though surely, the exclusive policy of the
Colonies is making a deep impres- sion on the minds of the Indian
people, and it cannot but make the task of government in India more
and more difficult as it becomes known that for an Indian the
privilege of British citizenship or British connection means little
or nothing outside India, and that no matter what his status or
ability may be, he is not wanted by the Colonies.</p>

We have not in any way whatsoever cast any reflections on the
planters. All we care for is an investigation in the interests of all
concerned. That the figures we produced were staggering no one would
deny, but âAnglo Indianâ has questioned them. We can only,
therefore, draw his attention to the corroboration given to them by
Mr. Lyttelton, the Colonial Secretary, when he said that the  rate 
among the non-indentured Indians was 157 per million and among
indentured Indians 766 per million. If, therefore, we erred, we have
erred in very good company, and in spite of the remarks of âAnglo-
Indianâ and âA White Manâ, we adhere to the statements we have
made and urge that an enquiry should be instituted.</p>

The debate in the Legislative Council of the Transvaal on the Indian
tradersâ question and the publication of Mr. Lytteltonâs des-
patch mark a most important stage in the history of this much-vexed
controversy. On the one hand, the Home Government finds that it
cannot, consistently with national honour, give away the rights of
the British Indians which they jealously guarded during the Boer
rule. On the other hand, the local Government and the Colonists seem
to be bent upon rooting out the Indian. More than once has Sir George
Farrar expressed in emphatic terms that probably the first act of a
responsible Government when it came would be to extinguish the Indian
trader by giving him compensation. We all know what the giving of
compensation means! Thus, then, there is a direct conflict between
Imperial interests and local prejudice<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>we
will not dignify it by the name of local interests, because we
venture to think that the presence of the Indian in no way
constitutes a menace to the white community. We have in these columns
times without number shown that the white trader has not been driven
out either in the Cape or Natal, where the Indians enjoy
comparatively greater rights than in the Transvaal, but that they are
earning side by side with the white man an honest livelihood. The
unmeaning prejudice takes no account of the immeasurably superior
facilities that the European enjoys in many respects, and the
organising power which the Indian lacks. These two more than
counterbalance the so-called cheap living of the Indian. But, as a
matter of fact, nobody has ever asked for unrestricted trading rights
on behalf of the Indians. All that is necessary is to absolutely
protect vested interests, and to allow the Indian a reasonable share
in future trade. To see men like Sir George Farrar and Mr. Bourke
haranguing about the impending ruin threatening the Colony in the
event of the Indians being allowed to continue to trade<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>when
they must know that the Indian is an almost negligible quantity, when
one of them alone could but out every Indian in the colony thrice
over<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>is  a most humiliating
spectacle unworthy, shall we say, of those who profess to be guided
by British traditions. If so much could, with justice, be said of the
non-official members of the Legislative Council, what are we to think
of the attitude of the Government? What are we to think of the Lord
Milner of today asking Mr. Lyttelton to take</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="48. MEMORIAL TO COLONIAL SECRETARY"></a>
away practically everything from the Indian, and of the Lord Milner,
on the eve of the war, who persisted in his advocacy of the Indian
cause, and who would not barter away the rights of one class of
British subjects for the sake of securing those of another class?
Lord Milner prides himself on being an out-and-out Imperialist. Is
His Excel- lencyâs Imperalism confined to South Africa only? The
reading of Mr. Lytteltonâs despatch has been both pleasant and
distressing. What the local Government was ready to grant in the
beginning of 1902, it has now retracted. What Lord Milner promised to
do, when  he  justified the now notorious Bazaar Notice No.356 of
last year, has now been retracted. His Excellency the
Lieutenant-Governor, instead of taking up an impartial attitude, has
constituted himself an exponent of the anti-Asiatic policy. All this
is painful. Mr. Lyttelton, therefore, takes up the cudgels on behalf
of the Indians, and on behalf of the Imperial policy and promises
made by British statesmen and minis- ters. He shews conclusively that
there can be only one solution of the question, namely, to grant
reasonable rights to British Indians. But the reading becomes again
distressing when we come to look at his final proposals, which seem
merely to require the protection of the exis- ting trading licences,
leaving the principle of compulsory segregation intact, as also the
great principle of Colour legislation. But all this later, because
even what little the Colonial Secretary requires, the Transvaal
Government is not prepared to grant. We have no doubt that the
resolution of the Legislative Council has been cabled to the Home
Government, and much will depend upon the attitude that may be
assumed by it.</p>

year, on the status of British Indians in the Transvaal, contains
certain matters which have deeply grieved my Association, and I  am,
therefore, directed to humbly submit the following to His Excellency
and to request that the same may also be forwarded to His Majestyâs
Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>

The despatch recommends the immediate adoption of the recommendations
made therein as to alteration in the existing law with regard to
British Indians, and based before on two incidents, the first being
the test case of Habib Motan and the Government, underlying which is,
in the words of His Excellency, the problem of self- preservation,
and the second, the prominence into which the question came owing to
the outbreak of bubonic plague.</p>

To take the second incident first, my Association ventures to submit
that it has been shown most conclusively that the Indians residing in
the Location were in no way responsible for the outbreak. My
Association would gladly have refrained from making  any remarks in
the matter, but as it is responsible for the statements supplied in
this instance to Sir Mancherjee Bhownaggree, and as his information
has been controverted by His Excellency, a brief explanation has
become necessary in justice to my Association.</p>

It will be recollected that the plague was officially declared as
having broken out on the 18th March last. The Location was expro-
priated by the Johannesburg Town Council on the 26th September last
year. Before that date, each owner of the Stands in the Location was
held responsible for a proper sanitary upkeep thereof. The  owners,
therefore, employed men in order to keep the Stands in a clean
condition, and up to that date, no epidemic was known to have arisen
in the Location, and the Indian community had remained parti- cularly
free from infectious or contagious diseases. The sanitary control,
from the 26th September, 1903, passed into the hands of the Town
Council. The owners were not allowed to have any say either as to the
manner in which the Stands were kept or as to tenants that were
received. Instead of one man or men to clean each Stand, there were a
few men employed by the Municipality to look after the whole area.
The result was that they were totally unable to cope with the work.
The population, too, went up considerably, as, regardless of the
accommodation in the Location, the Town Council accepted tenants.
Complaints were frequently made about this unsatisfactory state of</p>

that an immediate improvement without any cost to the Town Council,

leasesâsix monthly or quarterlyâbe given to the Stand-holders.
The leases may state exactly how many people are to be kept on each
Stand, or in each room. The lesees could pay, say 8 per cent. on the
valuation of the valuators, and should be made strictly responsible
for the sanitation of the Stand leased by them.</font></font></p>

Here, then, in the humble opinion of my Association, there was
nothing left undone by the Indians residing in the Location. It was
with them purely and simply a matter of helplessness. There was now-
here else for them to go to. It was impossible to vacate the Location
and overrun the town. In spite of urgent entreaties, no site was
fixed for them in lieu of the expropriated Location. Dr. Porterâs
opinion about the condition of the Location, which my Association has
taken exception to, was given in 1902, and yet, up to the time of
expropriation, (that is, for nearly one year,) the Location was
allowed to remain in the same condition without any epidemic having

It is also noteworthy that Indians have been no more liable to the
disease in the Transvaal than the other communities outside the
Location, that is to say, where they had control of their premises.
For instance, in Pretoria and Potchefstroom, where there are Indian
Loca- tions, there were practically no cases of plague amongst the
Indians.</p>

As to the first-mentioned point, in dealing with it, His Excellency
has dwelt on three illustrations, namely, Johannesburg, Pietersburg
and Natal. In the humble opinion of my Association, the fact that
Johannesburg has been able to hold its own  against  the British
Indian shews that the Indian is unable to compete with the European
in trade, except in petty trading, and then, too, he is not
successful in ousting the European, for it is notorious that, in
Johan- nesburg, the petty trade is mostly in the hands of aliens from
Europe. In Pietersburg, too, with the greatest deference to His
Excellency, the bulk of the trade, both wholesale and retail, is in
European hands, and the European houses, which are referred to by His
Excellency as hav- ing wholesale businesses only in Pietersburg, are
also, according to the information in possession of my Association,
carrying on a retail tra- de, whereas the Indians there confine their
trade to the retail branch.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
My Association respectfully submits that the comparison drawn from
Natal is very unfair to the British Indian community, for there is no
analogy between Natal and the Transvaal. The former has been
importing labour from India now for over thirty years, and the bulk
of the Indian population is under indenture. The free Indians who
have entered the Colony as independent men number less than ten
thousand (10,000). But even there, my Association ventures to submit,
the retail trade has not passed entirely into Indian hands. In all
the important towns, it is still controlled by the Europeans.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The following is the testimony given by Sir James Hullett only last
year as to the value of the Indian to Natal:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.99cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 105%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The
Arabs were limited and were traders almost entirely. The ordinary
small trader could not compete with the Arabs. The retail Kaffir
trade of the Colony was practically in the hands of the Arabs. In the
country districts, witness had no objection to this because he
thought the ordinary young white man or woman could do something
better than looking after Kaffir country stores. The Arabâs wants
were less than the ordinary white manâs wants, they sold at a
smaller profit and, to a certain extent, they dealt fairer with the
natives than the European traders, who, at the country stores,
desired to make such large profits. Apart from the country districts,
he supposedâfrom appea- ranceâthat Arab traders were doing an
ever-increasing business in the towns. They were supported to a
certain extent by white inhabitants. The white inhabitants, and with
a certain amount of justice, complained of the Arabs, but yet helped
to support them because of being able to get their goods cheaper from
them than elsewhere. But all this did not mean the climination of the
white man from trade altogether. (This witness said emphatically).</font></font></p>

Most public men there believe that Natal owes its prosperity to the
presence of the Indian. The special Commissioners, who, some years
ago, examined the whole question, said, especially with reference</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
to the British Indian trader, against whom His Excellency has been
pleased to advance so much argument, gave their opinion [<i>sic</i>]
as follows:</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">We
are content to place on record our strong opinion, based on much
observation, that the presence of these traders has been beneficial
to the whole Colony, and that it would be unwise, if not unjust, to
legislate to their prejudice.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.99cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 105%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Nearly
all of them are Mohammedans, either total abstainers from alcoholic
liquors, or drinking them in moderation. They are thrifty by nature

Out of the seventy-two European witnesses, who gave their evidence
before the Commission, almost every one  of those  who spoke as to
the presence of the Indian affecting the Colony has said that he is
indispensable for its welfare.</p>

But the most striking instance, perhaps, shewing that the Indian is
not the menace that he is popularly considered to be to the white
predominance, is to be found in the Cape Colony. That Colony has
never imported Indian labour, but up to last year, it was open to
receive any Indian who went there. Indians are entitled to own land,
they may take out licences to trade without any let or hindrance, and
they enjoy practically all the rights possessed by His Majestyâs
other subjects. And yet his competition has not told upon the
European community in any way whatsoever, except in so far as his
presence has stimulated healthy rivalry. There are at the Cape far
wealthier Indians than in the Transvaal, but they have not made any
appreciable impression on the ownership of land.</p>

My Association, therefore, ventures to submit that the past, in so
far as it throws any light on the question, does not bear out the
fears expressed by His Excellency.</p>

That the opposition to the British Indian is confined to  the  trader
class in the Transvaal, and therefore, purely interested, is, in the
humble opinion of my Association, plain from the fact that the Indian
depends largely upon European support. Having been found reliable,
the European banks give him credit, European houses sell him goods on
credit, and the European customers purchase goods from him, his best
customers being the Dutch people. It may here be mentioned that, even
during the Boer rule, a Petition, extensively signed by the Dutch
people as also the English people, was presented to the late
President Kruger favouring the presence of the Indian.</p>

The social and political equality, it is true, was never recognised
during the Boer regime as between white and Coloured people, but the
Indian, it will be readily admitted, has studiously kept himself
aloof</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
from intruding himself on any of the two departments.</p>

My Association craves leave to discuss the proposals made by His
Excellency which have been termed by him âconcessionsâ, but
which, in the humble opinion of my Association, constitute a further
encroachment on the small measure of liberty enjoyed by the British
Indian under Law 3 of 1885, which the proposals are intended to
replace.</p>

Under the proposals made by His Excellency, the issue of licenses
outside Bazaars would be restricted only to those who were carrying
on business at the commencement of hostilities, and, then only,
during the residence in this Colony of the licensees, a proviso which
materially curtails the possibility of expansion even for the few who
were trading at the commencement of hostilities. The proposal,
therefore, would ultimately mean a complete sweeping out of the
British Indian trader, except from Locations.</p>

Exemption from liability to reside in Locations is contemplated, but,

Exemption from registration will be merely nominal, as almost all the
old residents of the Transvaal have, in obedience to Lord Milnerâs
advice, paid the registration fee, and as the fewest possible new men

proposed to be introduced. As a matter of fact, the Peace
preservation Ordinance is employed to shut out every Indian who is
not a refugee, no matter what his intellectual attainments, social
qualities, or habits of life may be.</p>

may be devoted to religious purposes, but my Association may be
pardoned for saying that, when the bulk of the Indian population is
compulsorily segregated, the concession would be of little or no use,
and could not be availed of if the land is not allowed to be used for
purposes of drawing an income for the support of religious institu-
tions. Nor is the proposal altogether new, because, time after time,
Her late Majestyâs agents brought the matter to the notice of the
late President Kruger, who had promised to grant relief.</p>

His Excellency has been pleased to say that âthe British Indian
Association maintains that these sites (referring to the new
Locations laid out) are quite unsuitable, but they have in my opinion
overstated their caseâ. With the greatest deference to His
Excellency, my Association ventures to submit that it has always been
its endeavour to place facts without any varnish at all, and, in
making its submission regarding the new sites, my Association has, in
every instance, suppor- ted its objections with disinterested
testimony. The members of my Association, being most of them traders
of long experience, also claim to speak with confidence regarding
these sites, and however valuable they may become in the distant
future, for immediate purposes, save in one or two instances, they
are totally useless, situated as they are in isolated and uninhabited
spots where there has been no traffic. In Pietersburg, for instance,
the new site has been fixed nearly two miles from the town where, as
it is only a small village, there can be no traffic. It is,
therefore, a question purely and simply of establishing a new Indian
village. Half a dozen store-keepers removing there will have only
themselves to trade with. To say that removal to such a Location
would be tantamount to removal from Cheap-side to Hampstead Heath in
London would, in the humble opinion of my Association, be an
understatement of the case. And the very fact that these sites have
been fixed so far apart is a limitation of the powers vested in the
Government in virtue of Law 3 of 1885, which contemplates the setting
apart of âstreets and wardsâ besides Locations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
The crux, however, of the whole question is legislation in
anticipation of the future, and my Association cannot help saying
that the future being guarded against by the Immigration Act on the
Natal or Cape lines, there would appear to be no reason for the fear
of the Indian swamping the European in any department of life. As
against the ever increasing European population, the Indian
population, which may be estimated at twelve thousand (12,000), would
always remain stationary with the addition of the few who may be able
to enter the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Transvaal under the education test. In Natal, for instance, during
the five yearsâ working of the Act, only 158 new men were able to
enter the Colony under the test, when it consisted of a simple set
form. As His Excellency is aware, now the test has been considerably
raised, being the same as in the Cape Act, which makes it impossible
for any but those who have a fairly competent knowledge of the
English language to enter the Colony. And although my Association
does not share the fears expressed by His Excellency, in view of the
popular prejudice, it is prepared to accept the imposition of the
restriction, so long as reasonable facilities are afforded for
servants and salesmen, who may be absolutely necessary for the
carrying on of existing businesses, to enter the Colony.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
With reference to the issue of new trading licences to those who did
not at any time trade before war in the Transvaal, whether with or
without licences, my Association, in order to allay the popular
prejudice, and as an earnest of its desire to meet the wishes of the
European Colonists as much as possible, would be prepared to accept a
general measure, leaving it to the option of the Government or the
Local Boards either to grant or refuse such licences, subject,
however, to an appeal to the Supreme Court in cases of manifest
injustice; for instance, where the new applicant is supported by a
majority of European residents, provided, however, that the existing
licences are not in any way interfered with, except when the premises
are not kept in a sanitary condition or the licensee does not comply
with the regulations as to book-keeping, etc. Thus, the issue of new
licences will be regulated without any invidious legislation based on
distinction of colour.</p>

My Association respectfully submits that the prohibition to own fixed
property is as unjust as it is uncalled for, and to prevent a handful
of Indians in the Colony from buying land freely is mani- festly
contrary to British traditions.</p>

My Association has refrained from saying anything with reference to
the promise made on behalf of the British Government forty years ago,
because, in its humble opinion, the case for the British Indians is
exceedingly strong on its merits, but I may take the liberty of
saying that, if the situation when Sir Charles Napier gave his
proclamation in 1843 was different to what it is today, it was
certainly not so different when the late Lord Rosemead and the  late 
Lord Locke, as also Lord Milner, made, during the Boer regime, the
most strenuous effort on behalf of the British Indians and more or
less successfully protected their rights against encroachment by the
late President Kruger. The position, when the hostilities broke out
and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
when Her late Majestyâs ministers declared that the disabilities of
the British Indians were one of the causes of war, was also not very
different from what it is today.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
My Association, therefore, feels that the Indian community has not
been fairly treated in that these facts have been overlooked. My
Association respectfully submits that the Indians, as subjects of the
Crown, and as law-abiding and peaceful residents of the Transvaal,
have a claim to an impartial consideration of their position at the
hands of His Excellency as representative of the King-Emperor and
Head of the State.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The British Indians, moreover, may be excused for drawing His
Excellencyâs attention to the humble services that they, as a race,
have always rendered to the Crown. Whether it is in Somaliland,
Tibet, China, or in South Africa, the Indian soldier has, side by
side with the soldier from the British Isles, borne the brunt of the
battle. Lord Curzon spoke the other day in the following glowing
terms about Indiaâs services to the Empire:</p>

Sir George White generously acknowledged the services of the devoted
Prabhu Singh, who, at great risk, sat perched up on a tree within the
range of the Boer fire, and never once failed to give the warning of
the firing of the Boer guns from the Hill of Umbulwana during the
siege of Ladysmith. The Indian monument on the Obser- vatory Hill in
Johannesburg is also a testimony to the Indian contri- bution to the
war in South Africa. The British Indians in the Transvaal who belong
to that race are, in the humble opinion of my Association, entitled
to some measure of consideration, specially as to their vested rights
and their right to earn an honest livelihood in the Transvaal, with
dignity and self-respect, and without being perpetually reminded that
the colour of their skin is a bar to the ordinary civil liberty, as

makes a suggestion whereby the objectors themselves, namely, the
local authorities, would have the virtual control over the issue of
new licences. Could the Indians go further? It should not be
forgotten that, when the late Mr. Kruger wanted to nullify the
decision of the late High Court by Volksraad resolutions, there was
tremendous opposition. The Colonists, who then formed the Opposition,
are now asking for the very thing they opposed, for it is nothing
less than the decision of the Supreme Court that they wish to
override by stopping or suspending the issue of Asiatic licences.
Such a thing in a British country would be impossible if
self-interest did not temporarily blind the fine sense of British
justice. And yet, the British Indian Associa- tion, recognising the
popular prejudice, is prepared to forego very largely the fruits of
victory dearly won after a tremendous struggle. Personally, I do not
fear the verdict of any Commission that may be appointed, believing,
as I humbly but firmly do, that many of the objections raised against
the Indians have no foundation in fact. The number of retail Indian
traders in the Transvaal is very small com- pared to the European.
But I think that the appointment of a Commi- ssion is unnecessary and
it will indefinitely postpone a settlement of the question. It will
be very surprising if Mr. Lyttelton goes back upon his despatch and
suspends the issue of Indian licences, pending the finding of the
Commission. The British Indian Association has ever tried to meet the
wishes of the Europeans. It has again made a supreme effort, and you
would, I submit, be serving the country by laying stress upon this
fact, especially in view of the extreme measures that are being
suggested at Potchefstroom and elsewhere. The time is of the essence
at present; the controversy has reached a stage which admits of a
definite decision as the only remedy. Session after session,
legislation has been passed, and each time the question has been
shelved. The Association has made definite proposals which, I venture
to think, afford a reasonable solution worthy of a trial, at any
rate. They have, moreover, the merit of disposing of the question
locally.</p>

If this is all that His Excellency means, we can see nothing
inconsistent with it in Mr. Lytteltonâs despatch, for he has
proposed that further immigration of British Indians should be
stopped, save for those who would satisfy the test laid down by His
Excellency. With reference to those that are already in the country,
he proposes that segregation for sanitary purposes, but not for
trade, may be allowed. There, then, remains the question of trading
still open,  but  Lord Milner has answered that question himself when
he says :</p>

last two [years], we have learnt things [which] enable us to know 
that  [howev]er, painful it may be to [have to] say so, Lord Milner
does not mean what he says. There is no intention to grant the
better-class Asiatic any special rights, and the vested rights have
tapered down to actual trade carried on by Indians on the 11th of
October,1899. For, was it not the contention of the Asiatic Tradersâ

only to investigate the cases of those who were trading at, and imme-
diately on, the commencement of hostilities, and that, under the
refer- ence, they could only deal with the cases of people who were
trading as far back as October 1899? Had it not been for the godsend
in the shape of the Supreme Court decision, more than 75 per cent of
the Indian traders would by this time have been wiped out of
existence under the above reference, and probably the Colonial Office
would have done nothing. We, therefore, plead for a frank statement
of the policy. As to the European opposition also, we have to protest
against His Excellency laying so much stress upon it for two reasons:
[first] no opposition on the part of one body of British subjects
could be allowed to avail in order to take away the legitimate rights
of another body; [second] the opposition is fostered by the
Government itself. Mr. Lytteltonâs despatch has in that respect
been an eye-opener. Although Mr. Duncan and Sir Richard Solomon made
what appeared to us to be a righteous defence on behalf of the weaker
party, when the Asiatic Tradersâ Commission was appointed at Sir
George Farrarâs instigation, both of them, as would appear from the
despatch, have been asking Mr. Lyttelton as vigorously as they could
to take away practically everything from the Indians. We find the
same subservi- ence to European sentiment in the Legislative Council.
The motion proposed by Sir George Farrar, regarding a Commission to
be appoi- nted from England, and a stoppage of the issue of all new
Indian licences in the meanwhile, is gladly accepted by the
Government. When the late Mr. Kruger passed any resolutions to
nullify the deci- sions given by his High Court, he was furiously
blamed. His conduct was considered to be brutal, short-sighted, and
all the ugly names that could be given him were brought into play.
Not a voice, however, is raised in protest when the very same thing
is proposed by the representative of the British Crown, namely, to
take away the right of the Indian to trade in the Colony, which has
been emphatically recog- nised by the unanimous decision of the
independent judges of the Transvaal. We hope, therefore, that Mr.
Lyttelton will realise the posi- tion in which the British Indians in
the Transvaal are placed, and will realise also that the local
Government, having so thoroughly allied itself with the popular
prejudice, is hardly in a position to give an unbiassed opinion. The
fact is that, rightly or wrongly, it has been very much discredited.
There is intense dissatisfaction among the people of the Transvaal
with reference to its policy in many other matters. It is, therefore,
afraid to do right in the Indian case, because it</p>

is that of people who are voiceless and who are powerless to give any
trouble to the Government. May Mr. Lyttelton have sufficient strength
to save what he has termed âthe national honourâ in connection
with the Indian question is our fervent prayer.</p>

The matters have now reached a crisis with reference to the Indian
question. The <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>would give you all the
information up to date. The representation of the British Indian
Association printed therein will, I think, shew the position clearly.
The proposals of the Association are as moderate as they possibly
could be and they represent the irreducible minimum that the British
Indians are entitled to. You will there see all the most reasonable
objections of the Colo- nists met. Even the point as to the
educational test has been yielded, but the right of review by the
Supreme Court on the question of licen- ces and the ownership of land
are absolutely essential. As to the latter, if necessary, certain
portions may be reserved for exclusive European ownership. As to the
licences, I may, at the risk of repetition, state the position
clearly. Any Licensing Act should leave untouched the existing
licences and the right to trade freely to those who were trad- ing
before war whether with or without licences but who have not yet
taken out licences since British occupation mainly because they have
not yet been allowed to return to the Colony, unless, of course, with
reference to these licences, the premises are not kept according to

sanitary requirements or because the books are not kept in the
English language. As to the new licences, the Government or the
municipal authorities may have full discretion subject to the right
of review. This will set the whole question at rest. The proposal is
based on the Natal model without its most unjust clause depriving the
Supreme Court of its inherent jurisdiction, a fact which has rendered
uncertain the position of every Indian trader there. If the proposals
of the Asso- ciation are accepted, the appointment of a Commission
would appear to be quite unnecessary. The licences could not be
suspended, as sug- gested by the Legislative Council resolution. And
if the licences are not suspended, I hardly think Lord Milner will
accept a Commission. In fact, the object of asking for a Commission
was to secure indirectly what Mr. Lyttelton declined to grant
directly. It would, too, indefini- tely postpone the question of
licences and, if Mr. Lyttelton agreed to suspend the issue of
licences, there would be no hurry on the part of the anti-Indians to
have any definite legislation.</p>

We have published the important dispatches from Lord Milner and Sir
Arthur Lawley, to which Mr. Lytteltonâs dispatch, also already
published in these columns, was a reply. These documents shew the
importance of the Indian question, not only in the Transvaal, but in
South Africa. The British Indian Association of the Transvaal has
sent in a representation to the Colonial Secretary, Pretoria,

</font></sup>,  controverting  some  of  the  assertions  made  by  
His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor in his dispatch, wherein he
has clearly shewn himself to be more a partisan than an impartial
admi- nistrator. There is throughout that dispatch an eagerness to
put for- ward all the points that His Excellency could conceive of as
being in favour of the European objections. He has not hesitated  to 
advise Mr. Lyttelton even to break the promises repeatedly given to
the British Indians in the name of the Government he represents. Now
we do not consider that in affairs of State there may not be
circumstances justifying a breach of promises once made, but in this
instance there is not a shadow of justification for it. Sir Arthur
Lawley has dwelt on Sir Charles Napierâs proclamation of 1843, and
thinks that the situation then was quite different from the one
presented to-day. As, however, the British Indian Association has
reminded His Excellency, that promise was acted on even up to 1899.
Not long ago, Lord Ripon laid it down as the emphatic policy of the
Government, in the dispatch, when he was Secretary of State for the
Colonies, that it was the wish of Her Majestyâs Government to treat
all her subjects on a footing of equality. We must confess that we
have failed to see a single circums- tance which would justify a
wilful breach of promises solemnly made and reiterated. Nor is there
any ground for magnifying the question out of all proportion, and
then justifying iniquitous differential legis- lation. One could
understand such an attitude if the doors of the Transvaal were
proposed to be kept wide open for the reception of the millions from
India, but in the same breath that Sir Arthur Lawley draws a lurid
picture of the state in which the Transvaal would be, if India was
allowed to pour her millions into the country, he also advo- cates
the adoption of the Cape Act<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>thus
reducing Indian immi- gration practically to a vanishing point. To
put a few thousand Indi- ans, under galling restraints, in a
population of one million white men,  a population, moreover, which
is ever increasing, is a measure that ought not to be tolerated for a
single minute in a British Colony. That Sir Arthur Lawley, however,
has been fit in his representative capacity to advocate such a
measure is a circumstance of ominous importance. What has happened
today with reference to the Indian question may happen tomorrow
regarding some other. It is the underlying prin- ciple which should
cause anxiety for the future. If the views held by His Excellency are
at all popular with the British administrators, they</p>

mark, in our humble opinion, a decline from the highest British
tradi- tions which alone have made the Empire what it is. And even
while the so-called âImperial waveâ is passing through the
Empire, seeds are probably being sown for its disruption. For the
sake of keeping up  a nominal connection with the Colonists, England
has to surrender all that is noblest and best in her. Looking at the
representation of the British Indian Association, it appears to us to
be unanswerable; and, if the proposals made therein are accepted by
the Government, they afford an extremely easy solution of the
difficult question. We consi- der that the Association could have
rested on the advantage gained by the decision in the recent test
case; but, since life is made up of com- promises, and a policy of
conciliation is preferable to any other, the Association has done
well in putting forward the most reasonable and conciliatory
suggestions as to immigrations, as also dealersâ licences. One
fact, however, must be borne in mind, namely, that it is, as it ought
to be, the irreducible minimum that the Indian community could be
expected to accept. We have never been able to reconcile ourselves to
the view of tabooing the Indian languages in the edu- cation test. It
is uncalled for, and it will ever remain a matter of sore- ness that
both Lord Milner and Sir Arthur Lawley refused to agree to the
perfectly just proposal made by Mr. Lyttelton that Indian langu- ages
should be recognised. However, for the sake of buying peace, and in
order to shew how reasonable the Indians are, as they have always
been even under most trying conditions, the British Indian
Association is prepared to accept an Immigration Act along the Cape
lines, and to give absolute control, subject to review by the Supreme
Court, over the issue of fresh dealersâ licences, which means
practi- cally for an Indian to surrender his right to trade, and yet
that is exactly what the Association has done. In return, all that
the Asso- ciation asks for is the right of ownership of fixed
property and yet, we are not sure that it would be a new thing, for
it is a question whether it is possible to attack the ownership
clause in Law 3 of 1885. The principle of compulsory segregation also
is repudiated by the Asso- ciation, and as the Supreme Court has
shewn, there is no compulsion warranted by Law 3 of 1885. In the face
of this fact, it is indeed strange that Sir Arthur Lawley should call
his proposals âcon- cessionsâ, and then tell Mr. Lyttelton that
he may have difficulty in carrying them out. Every one of His
Excellencyâs proposals, as a matter of fact, constitutes a fresh
restriction of the liberty of the British Indians. If, however, the
representation of the British Indian Asso-</p>

ciation is met in a fair spirit, the whole controversy can be closed,
at any rate for the time being, and the necessity of an expensive
commis- sion from England be avoided. The argument has  often  been
advanced that, seeing that the self-governing Colonies have been
allowed to pass certain laws, the Transvaal also ought to be placed
on the same footing. We may, therefore, incidentally mention the fact
that nowhere has the Home Government agreed to such extraordinary
proposals as those made by Sir Arthur Lawley. Australia, it will be
recollected, passed an immigration Act applying to Asiatics as such.
The Act was vetoed, and one of a general character based on the Natal
model had to be passed by that Colony. Natal itself, when it end-
eavoured to pass an Act specially directed against Asiatics, was
unsuc- cessful in the attempt. If, therefore, the legislation
proposed by Sir Arthur Lawley is at all countenanced, it will be
totally new departure on the part of the Home authorities.</p>

Permit restrictions against Indians entering the Transvaal be- come
more and more severe day by day, while greater facilities are being
afforded to the Europeans, whether British subjects or other- wise.
Now, officers have been appointed to board steamers on their arrival,
so that Europeans who may wish to proceed to the Transvaal may have
their permits granted to them without having to wait. On the other
hand, on the ground of plague, the Indians are being prevented,
whether they are at the Cape, Natal or Delagoa Bay, from entering the
Transvaal, and that, although they may give absolute proof that they
are refugees. The most glaring instance that has come to our know-
ledge is in connection with the visit of the Indian football teams
from Kimberley and Durban. In another column, we publish the whole of
the correspondence which speaks for itself. The Acting Chief Secre-
tary could not see why temporary permits should be granted to British
Indian  players  who,  be  it  remembered,  are  all  respectable  
men and living in European style, if that counts for anything.
Football is an  essential[ly]  English  game,  and  we  would  have 
thought  that Mr. Robinson would not have referred to it
sarcastically, as he has done in the correspondence in question. Mr.
C. Bird, Principal Under- Secretary, to whom the Indian players ought
to feel most deeply grateful, sent a pressing wire to the Permit
Secretary, which, too met with scant courtesy at the hands of the
Transvaal authorities. Mr. Bird was very emphatic. He said: âThe
Natal team are all respectable men,</p>

to go to Johannesburg than anyone elseâ. Nothing could have been
stronger, and coming as it did from responsible quarters, the
recommendation might have been listened to. But perhaps in the

The people at Potchefstroom seem to be very much exercised over the
few Indian store-keepers who are earning their livelihood in the
town. In their eagerness to drive every Indian away from Potche-
fstroom, they are resorting to intimidation. Only the other day, a
fire took place in an Indian store which, it is believed, is the work
of an incendiary. The papers say the Indians are alarmed, and that
the insu- rance companies do not take Indian risks, and that even the
white men living in the vicinity of the Indian stores have become
uneasy. Hap- pily, the police seem to be on the <i>qui vive </i>and
there seems to be no ground for great anxiety on that score. We are
grieved, however, to find that even the Potchefstroom Town Council
has allowed itself to be carried away, and has placed on record a
resolution unworthy of a representative body. The following is the
recommendation of the Health Committee of the Town Council:</p>

As we have already said in previous issues, there is no power given
in Law 3 of 1885, as amended in 1886, to compulsorily segre- gate
British Indians. The action of the Council would, therefore, be
utterly illegal if an attempt were made to enforce the resolution
above quoted. How, in the face of the dictum of the Chief Justice
with reference to this clause in his judgment in the Test case of
<i>Habib Motan </i>v. <i>The Government</i>, the Town Councillors of
Potchefstroom have thought fit to suggest that fifty special white
police be enrolled to put the Indians in the Location,<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>presumably

What the Indians have done in the Cape Colony to merit this
restriction, we do not know. The Indian population at the Cape is
small enough in all conscience, and the Cape politicians have often
made it a boast that, in that Colony, they are not guided by Colour
prejudice. The ink with which Mr. Schreiner penned his reply to the
<i>Bloemfontein </i><i>Post </i>on the Question of the Native
franchise is hardly yet dry, and we now read in the cape <i>Government
Gazette </i>the Procla- mation referred to. If, as Mr. Schreiner
says, it is true that the people  at the Cape are quite satisfied
that the native of the soil should enjoy the franchise right, and
that the test whereby a personâs merits should be judged is to be
not the colour of his skin but the degree of civili- sation attained
by him, this prohibition against the entry of the Indians into the
Cape dependencies appears to be unintelligible. If it is not a crime
for the resident Indians at the Cape to remain there, why should it
be a crime for them to enter its dependencies? Special circums-
tances could undoubtedly be conceived which would justify such a</p>

treatment, but certainly the Proclamation is totally silent. We are,
therefore, quite in order in concluding that the prohibition has been
issued against the Indians as such. We consider it to be a wanton
insult offered to the Indian community, aggravated by the fact that
the Cape Peninsula is practically closed against any new Indian
immigrants. Indeed, this latest invasion of the Indianâs right as a
British subject savours too much of the anti-Colour wave that is at
present passing over South Africa, and which was initiated last year
by the Transvaal Government issuing the Bazaar Notice 356 of 1903. We
hope that the British Indians at the Cape have protested against the
proclamation, and that they will not rest content until it is
abrogated or shown to be justified by any exceptional circumstances.
We have altogether too much of this kind of Proclamations against
which there seems to be no effectual remedy. The Letters Patent
which, if it were a question of passing legislation through the
proper channels,<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>as for instance,
the Legislative Council, <font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>would
have to be referred to the Home Govern- ment, but legislation by
Proclamation, as in the case in question, is evidently not under any
such control. The Governor acts without the assistance of the
legislative body, and his orders have the force of law. These
Proclamations are not submitted to the authorities in Downing Street
before they are issued. It, therefore, amounts to this, that some-
times it is really easier to tighten the yoke that grinds the Indian
in territories that are more directly under the Crown than where
there is a properly constituted legal machinery. This is a question
which we sub- mit for consideration by politicians in England who are
interested in the Imperial question of the status of British Indians
outside India.</p>

Death has removed from us a courteous gentleman and a publi- cist of
great ability in the person of Mr. Prisk. In a quiet and unassu- ming
manner, the deceased gentleman did a great deal for the com- munity
in his own special department. The life of a journalist is never an
easy one. He has responsibilities of which, perhaps, the public have
no adequate notion. On the one hand, he has to please his employers,
and, on the other, to represent public opinion, in doing which he may
have to make great sacrifices. He has often also to deal with
conflic- ting interests and examine matters that come before him, not
merely from the public standpoint, but also from his own, and when
his own views, conscientiously held, run counter to public opinion in
a given</p>

matter, the situation becomes very delicate. Mr. Prisk, however,
steered himself clear of all the shoals and rocks that come in the
way of newspapermen, and performed his duties unflinchingly. We can
well remember the assistance that he rendered in an encouraging
manner at the time when Indian famine relief subscriptions were
opened in Natal. Many of our readers will recollect the special
cartoons that were published as supplements to <i>The Natal Mercury</i>,
and the great space that was allotted to the famine literature in
that paper. We tender to Mr. Priskâs family our respectful
condolences, and hope his mantle will fall on worthy shoulders.</p>

Our contemporary, <i>The Star</i>, publishes the information that âa
White League has been formed in Pietersburg to take action on the
Asiatic question. The executive committee consists of three represen-
tatives of the Town Council, four delegates of the local Boer Vereen-
iging, and four other prominent townspeopleâ and that, at the Town
Council meeting, it was decided to approach the Government with the
object of obtaining authority for Municipalities to regulate hours of
business. We are not surprised at the idea of forming a White League
in such a hotbed of Colour prejudice as Pietersburg is. All we can
say is that we do not understand the reasons for this activity, for
Lord Mil- ner, with an iron hand, has stopped the entry even of the
few Indian refugees who were allowed to return to their homes per
month. In- deed, as our readers must have noticed, His Excellency
would not even allow temporary permission to an Indian football team
to pass the sacred precincts of the Transvaal. What, then, would the
White Leagues do to justify their existence, unless, like the
Potchefstroom vigilants, they intend to terrorise the resident
Indians? The proposed action of the Town Council with reference to
the regulation of closing hours, we sympathise with. We understand
that the Indians in Potchefstroom have taken the lead in the matter
and have decided to close their stores at the same hours as the
Europeans. And we can but hope that the Indians in Pietersburg will
follow the excellent example set to them by their Potchefstroom
brethern, and render it unnecessary for the Town Council to have any
such bye-laws. It will be a graceful and timely action on their part,
and perhaps, it will go a long way to shew the</p>

possible, they are anxious to conciliate their sentiments.</p>

We reproduce in another column an admirable letter addressed to the
<i>Transvaal Leader </i>by Mr. Abdool Rahman, the Secretary of the
Potchefstroom Indian Association. The letter shews clearly how mis-
taken the zeal of the Vigilantsâ Association is, and to what an
extent the Indians are prepared to meet the wishes of the white men.
The most important part of the communication, however, is the infor-
mation contained therein that the Indian merchants in Potchefstroom
have decided to close their stores at the same time as the Europeans.
This step has been taken without any pressure, and we consider that
it is one in the right direction and worthy of imitation by British
Indian merchants in other towns. Indeed, as it is, they have got a
very strong case, but this latest move on the part of the
Potchefstroom Indians makes their position much stronger. We hope
that Mr. Abdool Rahmanâs request for âsome reciprocation of the
sentiment from the European British subjects who, for better or for
worse, have to rely upon protection from the same flag that covers
the British Indianâ will meet with the response it deserves.</p>

As you will have seen from the British Indian representation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>in reply to Sir Arthur Lawleyâs dispatch, the
statement is reiterated, and lest the matter may be overlooked, I
again emphasis the fact that most of the sites are certainly unfit
for trade. The statement has been made not without totally
independent testimony from Europeans of stan- ding and all those
reports have been furnished to His Excellency. In Krugersdorp alone
is the site chosen at all good, and therefore, with- out any
compulsion, those who wanted Stands have applied for them. In other
places where new sites have been established, practically no
applications have been made.</p>

The chief thing, however, is to avoid compulsory segregation. So far
as the principle of Bazaars is concerned, people may  be  induced to
take up sites by setting apart Bazaars in suitable localities and the
problem will solve itself.</p>

The Blue book received this week from London shews very forcibly how
His Excellency has been less than fair in dealing with the position
of the British Indians. Sir Mancherjee resented the general
description of the Indians in South Africa as âAsiatics of a low
typeâ. His Excellency, therefore, has in reply appended to his
dispatch the correspondence that was published in <i>The </i><i>Rand
Daily Mail </i>during the plague epidemic, signed by some Indians.
When the  cordon  was, drawn round the Location, it is not surprising
that a few of them, con- sidering themselves to be better-living than
the rest, thought that, by throwing mud at the latter, they would
gain some advantage for them- selves, and so wrote the letter in
question. But His Excellency, who knows the exact position
personally, might have made use of his knowledge in order to correct
the exaggerations of the frightened correspondents. His excellency
ought to have known that the refer- ence was directed to the Indians
who were living in the Location, who undoubtedly, as a rule, are
below those who are living outside the Location. He might have known
that they did not and could not represent the whole of the Indian
community; and the correspondence itself shews that even the writers
who were living in the Location resented the idea of being classed in
the same category as some of the lowest-class Indians, and be cooped
up in the Location. From that point of view, they were perfectly
correct, because we have seen and known many decent-living people in
that locality, some of them having well-built, substantial
residences. With due deference, therefore, to His Excellency, it may
still be said that to describe Indians in South Africa as âAsiatics
of a low typeâ is âunfortunateâ.</p>

Our contemporary, <i>The </i><i>Natal Advertiser</i>, has
controverted Sir Arthur Lawleyâs description of Natal, namely, that
âthe moment one crosses the Natal border, he loses the impression

Indian faces on the main line, and, if you see a few porters at the

to employ indentured Indian labour. If, therefore, it is an evil, the
Colony has courted it itself, and in spite of His Excellencyâs

Mr. Lyttelton required definite observations on the statement
furnished to Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji that âthe sites for the Asiatic
Bazaars were utterly useless for tradeâ. His Excellency has
dismissed the matter in a few lines thus:</p>

unsuitable, but they have, in my opinion, overstated their case. The
objections raised by the townspeople have been also unreasonable. I

we make bold to say that His Excellency has not seen the</p>

new sites in the majority of cases. The British Indian Association
has reite-rated the charge and it is, to say the least of it, very
unfair that, without having seen the localities, His Excellency
should have made the state-ment he has, as against the testimony of
eye-witnesses who are, more-over, Europeans of standing in their own
towns, either merchants or medical men, quite competent to pronounce
a dispassionate judgment. It is they who have condemned the sites in
the majority of cases as totally unfit for trade, and often
unsuitable even from a sanitary stand-point. In any case, it cannot
be denied that in not a single instance have streets or wards been
assigned for Bazaars, but in every case, Locations have been set
apart and miscalled Bazaars.</p>

If we have dwelt at some length again on His Excellencyâs dispatch,
we have done so in order to shew how much more difficult the position
of Indians is rendered by the head of the State taking up a biassed
view of the situation. Important negotiations are still going on. The
question is undecided, and we think it right to lay stress upon the
fact that the British Indians have in no case overstated the
position, and that wherever they have been able to do so, they have
shown a wil- lingness to yield to European sentiment.</p>

I have your two letters, for which I thank you. Mr. Omar, too, told
me what you had advised in your letters. I shall endeavour hence-
forth to divide my communications whenever it becomes necessary. I
have written to Mr. Nazar to send directly <i>Indian Opinion </i>with
the marks as you suggest. The Government has written saying that it
does not propose to introduce legislation along the lines laid down
in the latest representation submitted by the British Indian
Association. This shews that the Government is not going to be
satisfied with merely accomplishing its object, to restrict future
Indian immigration and to regulate the issue of licences to new
applicants. It evidently intends to establish the principle of
legislation applicable to British Indians as such. If so, it is a
most dangerous doctrine and it will be a reversal of Mr.
Chamberlainâs policy. If differential legislation is sanctioned for
the Transvaal, the Cape and Natal will certainly follow suit.</p>

As Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji walked slowly to the centre of the platform,
the great audience that filled the vast hall stood silently and
uncove- red before him. Simple as was the deed, the earnestness and
unanimity of its performance rendered it most impressive,
particularly when it was borne in mind that the same homage was
rendered by the representatives of so many and such very different
peoples and nationalities. Then, after a sorrowful tribute had thus
been paid to the people whom Mr. Naoroji represented, a tremendous
and enthusiastic demonstration was made in honour of the
representative himself. From the people of India, the thoughts of the
great audience centred on the dignified person of Mr. Dadabhai
Naoroji. They remembered what had been said concerning his life-long
endeavours, and awakended the echoes by their cheers, by the clapping
of hands and shouts of welcome and applause. Long and earnestly was
the ovation continued, and it made an indelible impression on all who
witnessed this great manifestation of that international solidarity
which has spread, not merely from nation to nation, but from
continent to continent.</font></font></p>

father of India, as Mr. Dadabhai is endearingly called by the
Indians, is held in esteem by the people of Europe. Mr. Dadabhai,

sum of  Â£3 as the price of being allowed to remain in the Colony. As
 to the regulation and control of the licences, the British Indian
Association has offered it to them. And as to forcing the Asiatics to
vacate the towns and country districts and to reside in Bazaars, we
could hardly conceive that it is seriously required, if the gentlemen
can get full control of the licences. It is worthy of note that on
the League is represented very prominently the Town Council of
Pietersburg. Side by side with this establishment of the Transvaal
White League, prepara-tions, so the Johannesburg papers say, are now
being made to canvass signatures to the Petition, which emanated from
the Potchefstroom Vigilance Association, and it has already appeared
in this paper. Supposing that it is singed by every adult European
male in the Transvaal, would it make the proposal for confiscation-
and it is nothing else-legal or justifiable? Or would it be the clear
duty of His Majestyâs Government, in spite of the Petition, to
protect the vested interests and rights of the British Indians ?</p>

Transvaal Government to the curious coincidence at both places. At
Potchefstroom, the activity of the Vigilance Association synchronises

A correspondent from Warmbaths in the Transvaal writes to us in
Gujarati, complaining that the authorities do not provide facilities
for British Indians to make use of these famous healing waters. He
says that, if any Indian wants to make use of them, he is merely
directed to go to the rooms set apart for the Kaffirs. It appears
that he offered to build a place for Indians, but the offer was not
entertained. We are sure that, if there is any truth in the statement
made by our correspondent, the Government will remedy the difficulty
at once, and provide suitable facility for those Indians who may wish
to make use of these waters.</p>

We reproduce in another column a letter written by the Cape
Government to Mr. A. Kadir, Secretary of the British Indian League at
Cape Town, in connection with the complaint made by the League
regarding the working of the Immigration Restriction Act. The letter
is courteous enough, but beyond that we cannot say much for it. In
not one essential particular has any concession been made by the
Government, and shelter has been taken behind the legislation passed
from which relief was asked for. The League made a very reasonable
request that some facility should be given to the resident merchants
for importing servants from India in place of those who might return
to India.  The answer given is that such a servant, if he does not
know  a European language, cannot enter the Colony. A similar reply
has been given with reference to minor brothers of persons who may be
domiciled in the Colony, but the answer merely begs the question. If
the Government is really anxious, as is stated in the opening para-
graph of the letter, âthat the law should be administered so as not
to cause unnecessary hardship to any individual, or to any particular
sec- tion of the community, irrespective of class, creed or colourâ
there is</p>

ample power given to it to give relief in the desired direction. A
clause in the Cape Act provides for special exemptions being made,
and we certainly think that, if the resident merchants are to be at
all consi- dered, they ought to have the right to import servants.
Whether they may be able to write in a European language or not, the
servants might be allowed to enter the Colony under restrictions, and
without being given the full rights of citizenship, but if total
prohibition is enforced, it means that the position of the domiciled
Indians would become more and more difficult as days go by, and as
the indigenous supply of servants is exhausted, as it is bound in
time to become; we hope that the Secretary of the British Indian
League will not leave the matter until full justice is done.</p>

We extend a hearty welcome to Mr. Omar Hajee Amod Zaveri, who has
returned after a long absence from the country, and after a prolonged
visit to Europe and America. We think that Mr. Omar was well advised
in paying a visit to these continents. The more our mer- chants go to
these countries, the better able they would be to succeed in
business, as also in other departments of life. After travelling in
Europe and America, not merely for the sake of pleasure, but for the
sake of gaining knowledge and broadening oneâs mind, one is able to
cope with many difficulties, especially such as face an Indian in
south Africa, and Mr. Omar has set in this respect an example worthy
to be followed by other merchants. We hope that Mr. Omar will make
full use of the knowledge he has gained during his travels and,
wherever necessary, put it into practice.</p>

The other regret that the writer expresses is that there should be
any Kaffir policemen in Durban. If the traveller had enquired suffi-
ciently about the history of Durban, he might have known that though
a white manâs city, as he calls it, it owes its beauty and grandeur
to the presence of the Indian; he might have known that the Durban
Corpo- ration employs a very large number of indentured Indians in
order that travellers like âAn English Magistrateâ may find all
the modern comforts of life. As to the other regret of his: in
deference to the poor Kaffir constable, we cannot help saying that
Durban owes its com- parative freedom from crime to his presence, not
because the Kaffir police are more efficient than the European
police, but because it is impossible for the Borough to afford the
necessary number of police- men [except] by employing the lower-paid
Kaffirs. But for the pre- sence of the Indian and the Kaffir police
in white manâs or otherwise. Why, then, such un-English jealousy?
Or is there something insidious in the South African climate itself
which makes a man forget his tradi- tions?</p>

I have purposely refrained from writing to you from time to time as I

the oppressed including the British Indians, has completely turned
round and, as you will see from his dispatch, is quite prepared to
deprive the Indians of even what little rights they possessed in the
Transvaal before war. I enclose the representation of the British
Indian Association in reply to the dispatches which would shew how
far the Indians are prepared to go. You will see that therein the
Indians are willing to concede almost all that the Europeans would
want, namely, restriction of Immigration and regulation of licences
by local authori- ties in exchange for the right to own landed
property, but the proposal has been rejected by the Government as
unsatisfactory, simply, I fear, because it wants to establish the
principle of differential legislation. The British Indian Association
says the legislation, whatever it may be, should be applicable to
all; the Transvaal Government wants to pass a measure which would be
applicable only to Asiatics, whether British subjects or not. Such
legislation, as you are aware, has not been sanc- tioned even for
self-governing Colonies, as, for instance, the Cape and Natal,
although at both the places Government intended to pass such
legislation.</p>

	is indi- rectly a complete answer to Sir Arthur Lawleyâs
	contention that the Asiatic Bazaar sites have been well chosen, and
	that they afford scope for both the Native and the European trade.
	The Public Health Com- mittee at first fixed upon a site very near
	the Malay Location. It then recommended the site which was chosen by
	the Boer Government, and now it has fixed upon the site which was
	used as an isolation camp during the plague outbreak, and which is
	situated thirteen miles away from Johannesburg. And it is there that
	about five thousand Indians, including hawkers and traders, with the
	exception of a few old esta- blished merchants, would be removed, if
	the Committeeâs recommen- dations are carried out, and here are

was taken and the number is now about the same as then. And yet, the
Indians have not been able to oust the Europeans in any department
whatsoever. White Johannesburg is still white, and yet the  Public
Health Committee has suddenly found out that the presence of the
Indian population will âmaterially impede the growth of the
self-sup- porting European populationâ, although the European
population is ever on the increase, whereas, owing to the
misapplication of the Peace Preservation Ordinance to the Indians,
the Indian population is and must be on the decrease. The census
statistics produced in support of the contention are utterly
misleading, and could only be meant for consumption in England, for
they cannot possibly mislead the people on the spot. The statement
that the Coloured population of the Trans- vaal already outnumbers
the white population by 77.83 to 22.17 is a misrepresentation, for
which, we must confess, we were not prepared from a representative
body like the Public Health Committee of Joha- nnesburg. What
possible connection there can be between the vast Native population
of the Transvaal and the Coloured population, we cannot understand,
and if the Public Health Committee had only taken the trouble to deal
with the Indians for whom alone the Location is to be established, it
could have shown conclusively that the fears about the Indians
cutting out the Europeans are imaginary, for the Indian population is
hardly more than 7,000 as against 84,000 whites in Joh- annesburg,
and the Indian population of the Transvaal is hardly over 10,000 as
against the European population of 300,000. On the one hand, to talk
of Indian competition ruining the whites and, on the other hand, to
dangle before the English public figures including the Native
population, and then shew the terrible disproportion, is hardly
worthy of a great public body. Then, the Committee has gone into a
comparison of the position as between Johannesburg on the one hand,
and Natal and Pietersburg on the other. This is a second edition of
Sir Arthur Lawleyâs comparison. We have already dealt with this
phase of the controversy,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and humbly endeavoured to shew that it is all in favour
of the Indians. The Committee now boldly states  that  the British
Indians should not have any share in the European trade at all, and
thatâthe Bazaar should be kept completely apart from any
neighbourhood inhabited by Europeansâ, and it is for that reason
that the Committee has chosen the wilderness at Klipspruit for
dumping down the Indians, who can neither do any hawking nor any
trade, except among themselves and the few Kaffirs. But the Kaffirs
cannot</p>

be any customers of the Indians because, being most of them work-
men, they will have to go to town early in the morning and return
probably about eight oâclock at night. They are, then, not likely
at that time to go to the Asiatics and make their purchases there;
they will naturally make them in town. The charge of insanitation has
also been dished up again.âIt is impossibleâ, says the Committee,
âby any method of supervision to insure the observance of the
Public Health Bye-Laws by these peopleâ. We challenge the Committee
to produce statistics in support of the contention, we ask for
figures shewing how many prosecutions under the Public Health
Bye-Laws have taken place against the Indians; in how many cases they
have neglected to conform to the regulations. So far as we are aware,
and we know Johannesburg Indians a bit, we would be much surprised if
there have been six prosecutions against British Indians throughout
the year, and we make bold to say that in hardly a single instance
has there been a second prosecution against the same man. Sanitary
ins- pectors throughout South Africa have laid stress upon the
docility of the Indian and his willingness to comply with lawful
orders. The Committee says:âThe recent outbreak of plague, and the
events connected with it, proved the difficulty of effectively
isolating a Location situated within the town itselfâ. Either,
therefore, Dr. Pakes, who in his report shewed that he had
successfully cordoned [off] the Indian Location and thus stamped out
the plague, was wrong, or the Public Health Committee is wrong. Dr.
Pakes has been congratulated upon his splendid work, and it is
offering an insult to him to imply that effective isolation was
impossible, owing to the Location being situated within the town. We
deny the reckless statement of the Public Health Committee that the
Indians are particularly susceptible to smal- lpox. The experience in
Natal shews that such has not been the case. And as to the plague,
too, we question very much that the Indian is necessarily more
susceptible. The plague, which originated in the  Indian Location,
and for which the Public Health Committee alone was responsible,
remained confined to the Location, and if the number of cases in the
Location be eliminated, it will be found that the Indians were not
more attacked than others. The last reason given by the Public Health
Committee is the miserable plea of social intercourse between the
poorer whites and the poorer Indians. In the first instance, there is
absolutely no social intercourse between the two, and, in the second,
we would very much like to know in what way the presence of the
Indian has contributed to social deterioration of the white man; what
is the particular vice of the Indian community which the white man
has contracted during the last seventeen years. And the pheno- menon
of the two classes living side by side is by no means peculiar to</p>

Johannesburg. They have been doing so in Cape Town, in Kimberley, in
Durban, in Mauritius, in Ceylon, in India. Nowhere has this charge
been brought against the Indians; nowhere has this plea been urged
for the complete isolation of the Indians. Better by far that,
instead of such slow torture, as is proposed by the Public Health
Committee, the Indians should by legislation be bundled out of
Johannesburg, once and for all. Either the resident population should
be well treate or it should be driven out of the country. The latter
operation, though drastic, would be far more merciful than the
process of slow but sure arsenical poisoning, in the shape of cooping
the community up within an enclosure miles away from its scene of
activity, and letting it die for want of nutrition.</p>

The Natal Licensing Act still continues to remain the Damoclesâ
sword hanging over the heads of the Indian store-keepers in Natal. So
long as this un-British law disfigures the Statute-book of the
Colony, so long will the Indian stores be without any value as a
mercantile asset. Mr. Hoondamal, a silk merchant of long standing
depending entirely on high-class European custom, having received
notice to vacate premises in a principal street of Durban, removed to
another shop in West Street. He holds the usual trading licence which
enables him to trade up to the 31st December next. He, therefore, did
not suspend business until the transfer of premises was registered by
the Licensing Officer. The Officer refused to register the transfer.
He still continues his business and lodged notice of appeal. In a
court of law, such notice would leave things in <i>status </i><i>quo</i>.
But the Licensing Officer, who holds autocratic powers, felt that his
dignity was hurt by Mr. Hoondamal continuing his business. He,
therefore, brought him before the Magistrate, who considered quite
improperly, we submit, that the defendant traded in defiance of the
authorities, and imposed the maximum penalty of Â£20. Notice of
appeal has been lodged and we, therefore, refrain from making any
further comment on this extraordinary decision. We would only remark
that, if the decision is sound, no subject of the King may with
impunity act upon his interpretation of the laws of the country. We
commend this case to the attention of the Government as showing that,
until the law is  altered, there can be no rest for the poor Indian
merchants of Natal.</p>

The last has yet not been heard of this most important case. Since we
wrote about it in our last issue<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  it  has  entered  upon  the second stage. It will be
remembered that the defendant, Hoondamal, when he was charged before
the Magistrate for trading without a licence, applied in vain for
adjournment, pending judgment on his appeal to the Town Council
against the Licensing Officerâs refusal to sanction transfer of his
licence from the Grey Street premises to West Street. The appeal was
heard on Friday, October the 7th and, after the farce of a formal
hearing and a great speech by Mr. Binns on behalf of the applicant,
was dismissed. For his refusal, the Licensing Officer gave two
reason, namely, that the applicant already held five licences, and
that it was not desirable to add to the number of Asiatic merchants
in West Street. Mr. Burne, the only lawyer-Councillor of the Council,
was bold enough to expose the <i>suppressioveri </i>that the
Licensing Offi- cer, in his zeal to serve his masters, thought fit to
practice. He was able  to get an admission from the Officer that the
five licences were not shop licences but hawkersâ licences. Asked
as to the reason why he did not mention the fact in his statement of
reasons, he said he did not consider it necessary. Mr. Burne thought,
as many people have done, that the omission to mention such a
material fact savoured very much</p>

of an attempt to mislead the Council and the public. The other reason
given by the Officer was, we say with all deference, no less dis-
creditable to West Street, which has only eight Indian stores as
aganist about 100 European stores. If, therefore, it were a question
of bare proportion, the time can hardly be said to have arrived for a
total pro- hibition of Indian licences in that street. But the facts
that Mr. Binns conclusively proved before the Council show how cruel
has been the injustice done in the case, and how clearly the question
has been treated purely on racial lines. For it was proved that the
appellant had been in trade in Durban off and on since 1895, that his
business, which consisted of the sale of Indian and Japanese silk and
fancy goods, in no way competed with the European houses, that his
custom was entirely European and that of the better class, that the
premises he occupied were, in point of elegance and sanitation,
suitable in every way, that he was himself cultured and of high
standing in the Indian community, and that over a dozen European
firms testified to his being in every way a desirable and fit person
to receive permission to trade in the premises in question, and that
over forty European house- holders strongly supported the
application, and that he had already carried on his business in West
Street<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>, which
he was obliged to leave because his lease had expired, and because
his landlord wanted the premises. The only ground, therefore, for
robbing the man of the opportunity of earning a decent livelihood was
that of the colour of his skin. We do not wonder that Mr. Binns
indignantly protested that what would be treated as a laudable
enterprise in a European was deemed a cause of unfitness in his
client. And here, be it noted, there was little regard shown for the
interests of the Indian landlord. The taunt has been often flung
against him that he does not keep pace with the times and builds only
shanties. Now, in the present case, he has gone to the expense of
several thousand pounds in building stores which would compete with
the best of their kind in West Street, even in ornamental design. And
lo! the reward for his pluck is a prospect of ruin, and for the
applicant who has been endeavouring to live up to the best western
standard, a prospect of insolvency. This, moreover, is one of those
cases which the late Mr. Escombe thought could never be touched by
the Licensing Act. We quote below extracts from his spee- ches at the
time of introducing the measure, as also the late Sir Henry Binnsâ
prophetic remarks thereanent. We shall have to deal with the</p>

The Town Council has considered the very important report of the
Public Health Committee, and adopted, with painful unanimity, the
operative suggestions made by the Committee. Under it, the Indians,
as well as the Malays, are to be housed, should a compulsory segrega-
tion ordinance be passed, on the Klipspruit Farm, near the Native
Location, a distance of 13 miles from Johannesburg. Mr. Quinn, in
commending the proposals to the Town Council, justified them on the
grounds that the Indians did not conform to the sanitary regulations,
that, if the Kaffirs were to be removed to Klipspruit,  the  Indians 
should be removed <i>a fortiori </i>because they were worse
neighbours than the former, that the Indian trade was confined to the
Indians and Kaffirs, and that, therefore, it would be no hardship to
them to be located at such a great distance.</p>

Now, the first objection is no founded on any data whatsoever. Mr.
Quinn stated in support that, even if there were prosecutions against
Indians, they returned to their old practice. We venture to
contradict the gentleman and publicly state that there has hardly
been a sanitary prosecution against an Indian without producing a
lasting effect. We would also add that, wherever proper supervision
has been</p>

exercised, the Indian has proved most amenable to such regulations.
To go no further, we would cite the instance of the Location at
Pretoria, as also the condition of the Indians in Heidelburg. In the
one case, owing to kind but firm supervision, the sanitary condition
of the type of Indians living in Locations is all that can be
desired. In the other case, that of the Indian store-keepers living
in the heart of the town is equally so. The second objection raised
by the speaker is no less flimsy than the first. For, if the Indian
is amenable to sanitary control, surely there can be no objection
against him as a neighbour. He has no war-dances, nor does he drink
Kaffirbeer. The third is merely a travesty of facts. It is unfair to
state that the Indian trade is confined to the Kaffirs and the
Indians. The pioneer Indian settlers in the Transvaal could not have
entered the country with a view to trade among the Indians, for there
were none, and it is a notorious fact that the Indians have a large
trade among the Dutch people and the poor whites. Underlying the
objection is the important admission that the Klipspruit Farm is not
suitable for the white trade at all. It should, moreover, be
remembered that the proximity of the Kaffir Location does not
necessarily mean that the Indians will have any trade among the
Kaffirs<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>if only for the simple
reason that Kaffirs would remain in the Location during night time
only and arrive from town  after business hours. If, then, it is
totally unjust to house the Indians at such  a great distance, it
would be doubly so to disturb the inhabitants of the Malay Location.
There may have been some ground for condemning the old Indian
Location from a sanitary standpoint; but not a whisper has been
uttered against the dwellers of the Malay Location. The vast majority
of them are, as the name implies, Malays, a clean-living, industrious
and perfectly loyal people. They have been in possession of the place
now a number of years. An attempt to dispossess them during the Boer
rule was frustrated owing to the efforts of the British Government:
are the poor people now to be summarily ejected and forced to live in
a wilderness in the name of the British Government ? The idea is
simply repugnant, and we hope that Mr. Lyttelton would not be a party
to such wholesale confiscation of the rights of people whose only
crime is that they wear a brown skin.</p>

The energetic Dr. Porter is again busy writing academic reports on
the insanitary condition of several places in Johannesburg. As in the
case of the late Insanitary Area, so in the present instance, he has</p>

drawn up a most lurid and sensational picture of what is known as the
township of Ferreiras in Johannesburg. He informs the Town Council in
the strongest terms possible that the area described by him should be
overhauled without the slightest delay. He says:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 96%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">There
are within these areas numerous houses, shanties, rooms, courts and
alleys, which, on account of the bad arrangement, crowding on area,
want of proper sanitary conveniences, and their wretched and
dilapidated condition, are not only dangerous and injurious to the
health of inhabitants in the vicinity, but are a very serious menace
to the municipality generally.</font></font></p>

Now, it is admitted that the area, such as it is, has been allowed to
exist for the last two years, at any rate. If it is so insanitary,
and we do not deny it is so, why has not the matter been dealt with
before this? We very much fear that, for months to come, the report
will merely remain on the shelves of the Town Clerkâs office, and
things will continue to go on much as they are today, though what we
want in the face of the present danger is not words, but deeds. The
report is undo- ubtedly interesting, also painful, reading. It is
also probabaly calcula- ted to alarm old women, and to put them on
their guard as to the con- dition of their houses and surroundings.
If the township is so danger- ously insanitary, it is ill-adapted for
half-measures. The buildings comprised within it should be burnt down
without a momentâs delay. We, however, very much fear that the
experience about the Insanitary Area will be repeated in the case of
the township of Ferreiras. It will be interesting to learn that the
population of the whole area is 1,812, of which 288 are Indians, 58
Syrians, 165 Chinese, 295 Cape, 75 black, and 929 (or more than half)
white. The population of the ins- anitary Stands is 255 coolies, 17
Syrians, 126 Chinese, 192 Cape, 31 black, and 241 white.</p>

Thus, in this neighbourhood, it is the whites who are more to blame
than the Indians, and the Town Council, most of all. And although it
is the whites who have to be dealt with more than any other class of
people, we do not for one moment suppose that any such thing will
happen. The report will be used for advocating further disabilities
on the British Indians. The Public Health Committee has already begun
to press it into service in order to compel them to reside in a
locality nearly 13 miles from Johannesburg. As a matter of fact, the
report is a condemnation of the inaction of the Town Council in not
attending to the proper sanitation of the place. When the Insanitary
Area Commission was appointed, this township was considered dangerous
to public health. But as nothing is done in Johannesburg except on
the sky-scraper scale, proper sanitary control was a thing beneath
the dignity of the Town Council.</p>

It seems pretty certain that Lord Milner is about to leave South
Africa for good. What the verdict of history will be on His Excellen-
cyâs work in this sub-continent, it is difficult to say. That he
brought the war to a successful issue ensures His Excellencyâs
title to glory as  a destructive statesman.  He, of all the men, was
the one strong hand at a most critical period, and, in spite of
reverses and gloomy  des-  patches from the generals who were
conducting the war, he remained absolutely firm and unshakable in his
determination to see the thing through. The invincible faith that he
had in his own pre-vision regarding the issue has not, we fear, been
the guiding star in the much more difficult task of reconstruction.
Nor, indeed, could it be said that His Excellency took the correct
view of the times that were to follow. Forming expectations which
were never to be realised, Lord Milner framed a top-heavy structure
on a weak foundation. The result has been enormous expenditure on the
administration of the country without an adequate return. In spite of
His Lordshipâs unceasing attention to every detail of
administration, and his great industry, the difficult problems, such
as the labour question, the Native question and the Asiatic question,
could not be said to have been solved in a satisfactory manner. The
importation of Chinese labour is yet in the experimental stage, and
it would be too early to pronounce a definite opinion one way or the
other. The vacillating policy adopted regar- ding the Native and the
Asiatic questions has satisfied neither party, and with respect to
the latter, even ânational honourâ has suffered in His Lordshipâs
hands. Thus, it is doubtful whether Lord Milner will rank as a
first-class constructive statesman.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.05cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 102%">
If it be true, as the London papers inform us, that there will very
soon be a change of power in England, it would be interesting to know
what the outgoing government intend to do for Lord Milnerâs
services to the Empire and the Conservative Party. We know that, some
months ago, it was given out that His Lordship was a very likely suc-
cessor to Lord Curzon at Calcutta. He would then be no doubt per-
fectly free from interference by the Liberal ministers and, apart
from the Imperial view of bestowing such patronages, the Conservative
Government have nothing better to offer to His Lordship. The specu-
lation, therefore, is of more than passing interest to the British
Indians in South Africa. We wonder whether the author of the despatch
to Mr. Lettelton, in the recently published Blue book on the British</p>

The authorities at Lydenburg have given notice to the Indians to
remove to the Bazaar for sleeping, within seven days, on pain of
being prosecuted for disobedience. A similar threat was held out in
Potchefstroom some time ago and nothing came out of it. In view of
the emphatic dictum of the Chief Justice of the Transvaal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Mr. Hoondamalâs case can no longer be looked upon merely as a
personal question, but it is one involving wide interests. By the
time this is in print, the appeal to the Supreme Court against the
decision of the Magistrate may have been decided. Last weekâs
proceedings, how- ever, deserve more than a passing notice. Mr.
Hoondamal, in spite of the Town Councilâs decision, but under legal
advice from a premier firm of solicitors, had continued to trade on
the strength of the licence issued to him to trade in the Borough.
The Licensing Officer, there- fore, again issued a summons, charging
him with the crime of trading without a licence<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>in
respect of the premises in West Street. The defendant applied for an
adjournment, pending the hearing of the appeal. The Magistrate
granted the adjournment and repudiated the suggestion of the
prosecution that the defendant was trading in con- tempt of Court.
And yet he made a most extraordinary order, namely, that the store
should be forcibly closed down, unless the defendant received
permission to trade.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 102%">
What, therefore, he granted with the one hand, he attempted to take
away with the other. For what could be the value of the adjourn- ment
if the store was to be closed? If the Magistrate was so certain of
the decision of the Supreme Court, why did he adjourn the proceed-
ings at all? But this point, important as it is, pales into
insignificance before the question whether the Magistrate had any
right to make the order he did. We understand that Mr. Hoondamalâs
solicitors have written to the Magistrate, informing him that he has
acted beyond his authority, and that he would be held personally
liable in the event of the forcible closing of the store. We have
always considered Mr. Stuart to be an impartial, sober, and fair
judge. But, with great deference, we must state that our confidence
in his knowledge of the authority possessed by him is much shaken. We
cannot conceive that he has consciously committed what, in our humble
opinion, is a grave error of judgment. For the effect of his
decision, if carried out, would take us back to the Middle Ages, when
the liberty of the subject was dependent on the mere caprice of the
judges whose jurisdiction and authority were circumscribed only by
their good sense.</p>

We do not question the right of the Council to regulate trade. We
have always considered it a privilege to render our humble assis-
tance in guiding Indian opinion and smoothing it whenever it has been
necessary. We think that the Council would be perfectly right in
generally reserving special areas for special trades. But all such
reser- vations, unless they are elastic enough, defeat their own end.
We would gladly co-operate with the Council in reconciling the Indian
mind to the idea that West Street should be very largely in the hands
of European merchants. But there is an important and necessary
prov-iso that the Indians already carrying on trade there, as also
Indian land- lords, should be fully protected, and that those Indians
who are prepared to satisfy the sanitary and ornamental requirements
in keep- ing with the best stores in West Street, and whose trade is
mainly Eur- opean, should not be prohibited from trading there.
Indeed, they should be encouraged, if it is true that the objection
is not against colour, and that, if the Indian conformed to the
European standard, he would be welcomed as a desirable citizen. Now,
the facts are that there are very<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Street,
and that the case under consideration satisfies all the tests above
laid down. May we not appeal to the Town Council to stay its hands
and free itself from the suspicion that, in prosecuting Mr.
Hoondamal, it is persecuting him and, through him, the Indian store-
keepers and landlords, who are anxiously watching the dramatic stages
through which this case has been passing.</p>

whom it will be difficult to replace. His advocacy of the Indian
cause was strenuous and well-informed. His unrivalled experi- ence of
India always stood him in good stead in answering his oppo- nents. He
was the founder of the Indian Political Agency, and the first Editor
of <i>India</i>, which has been doing eminent service, and without
disparagement, we may say that the editing of that journal by the
deceased gentleman has never been equalled. By his voluminous
writings, the late Mr. Digby ever kept the different Indian questions
before the public. We offer our sincere condolences to the deceased
gentlemanâs family.</p>

intimation of same was given by me to the Town Council. The Town
Clerk informed me on the 19th March that he was unable to take charge
of the patients or incur any financial responsibility until after the
21st, beyond giving the Government Entrepot to be used as a temporary
hospital and providing one nurse. This was originally a Customs
Depot. Thirty volunteers were put on to it. The place was thoroughly
cleaned and voluntary Indian nurses worked night and day, taking
charge of all the patients that were being received. Drs. Pakes and
Mac Kenzie, when they visited the hospital, now realised the gravity
of the situation and they took most effective steps on the 20th.
Every bed, all the medical comforts, food, and everything were in the
interval supplied entirely by the Indians. It is but fair to state
that the Town Council has since paid the expenses incurred. All this,
however, is beside the point, and if I have laid stress upon the work
done by the Indians, it is in order to shew that I am speaking from
bitter experi- ence and not without feeling. If the facts set forth
in the correspon- dence herewith sent are correct, <font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>and
they have not been challenged, although the conclusions I have drawn
have been repudiated<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>I would not
be serving the truth if I said anything less than I have done in my
letter of the 4th April last, namely, that, âbut for the criminal
neglect of the Johannesburg Municipality, the outbreak would never
have occurred.â It and it alone must ever be held responsible for
the awful death-roll of March. All honour to it that, after the
situation was real- ised, it spent money like water in dealing with
the calamity, but that work could never undo the past. It is true
that, as early as the year 1901, long official reports were drawn up
condemning the Location as insantitary. and yet, in that state it was
allowed to remain up to the 26th of September 1903, and that without
any outbreak of plague. Strange as it may appear, it was only after
the Town Council came into full possession, got what it wanted and,
with it, an opportunity of keep- ing the Location in a thoroughly
sanitary condition, that the plague broke out. I am afraid that His
Excellency has been totally misinfor- med with reference to the
genesis of the plague. The thing is now finished. The Indians have
suffered undeservedly but the statements made by me could easily be
verified. Dr. Pakesâ repudiation has, I suppose, reference to the
following occurring in the leader in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>:
âEvidently when Dr. Pakes said that the measures which were being
taken in the outlying districts were taken more in order to eradicate
the Indian than to prevent  the  plague,  he  spoke  trulyâ<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

certainly reported in</p>

Town Council. Since that date not only was there no opposition on the
part of the Indians concerned either against expropriation or
clearance, but I myself on their behalf frequently appealed for a new
site both to the Town Council as well as the Colonial Secretary. His
Excellency has evidently been informed that the expropriation was
effected after the outbreak of the plague. For His Excellency in his
dispatch again says:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: -0.07cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 105%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Up
to the date of expropriation the Indians were their own landlords,
and the statement that the conditions of overcrowding existing in the
Location were due to the general negligence of the Johannesburg Town
Council can only be described as a gross perversion of the truth.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 0.43cm">
Had expropriation taken place after the outbreak of the plague,</p>

I should plead guilty to the charge of having been the means of
perverting the truth. As a matter of fact, however, as already
stated, the Council expropriated the Location as well in law as in
fact on the 1st of October last year, and, contrary to the
suggestions made by the inhabitants of the Insanitary Area, and in
spite of the fact that the Council was not in a position to look
after the proper sanitation of the Location for want of men, it
became immediate landlord to each tenant, established rent collecting
offices, and took over the fullest control. The condition under the
new regime became so unbearable that the inhabitants, against whom
the charge of uncleanliness was repeatedly brought in official
reports, to which His Excellency has made reference, came to me with
complaints and I, therefore, wrote to Dr. Porter on their behalf on
the 11th February this year<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>that
is, more than a month before the actual declaration of the plague:</p>

venture to write to you regarding the shocking state of the Indian
Location. The rooms appear to be overcrowded beyond description; the
sanitary service is very irregular and many of the residents of the
Location have been to my office to complain that the sanitary
condition is far worse than before. There is, too, a very large
Kaffir population in the Location for which really there is no
warrant. From what I hear, I believe the mortality in</font></font></p>

On the 15th of February, in a second letter to Dr. Porter, I
elaborated the points mentioned in the first letter and even ventured
to offer suggestions, but up to the 18th of March nothing was done,
although on the 1st of March a note was addressed by me to Dr. Porter
saying that in my opinion the plague had actually broken out.</p>

I beg to enclose for His Excellencyâs perusal copies of all the
correspondence in this connection which was published in the papers.
The main facts to this day remain unchallenged, and knowing person-
ally as I do every phase that the inhabitants of the Location have
pas- sed through since the beginning of last year, with deference, I
feel bound to say that I have stated the barest truth in saying that,
but for the criminal reglect of the Johannesburg Municipality, the
outbreak would never have occurred. The immediate work lying before
it was totally neglected by it in favour of large schemes for
shifting the whole of the population within the Insanitary Area.</p>

In conclusion, I may state that, in writing to Mr. Naoroji, I had no
other desire than that of serving the truth and of guarding against
unwarranted charges against my countrymen.</p>

	The Conference has dealt with a great variety of matters, two of
	which dealt with Indians. The Conference passed some time ago a
	resolution to the effect that all the Indians should hold passes,
	for what reason it is not stated, except perhaps to insult the
	non-indentured Indian population. The Government have returned a
	reply saying that they are not prepared to pass legislation of the
	character wanted by the Conference. The Rev. Jas. Scott, therefore,
	moved that the reso- lution should be sent back to the Government.
	The President pointed out that, if too many restrictions were
	imposed on the Indians, the Indian Government might have something
	to say. Mr. Scott, however, said that in that case Natal could tap
	other sources of labour supply. We wish it were so. It will then be
	possible to arrive at a reasonable understanding as to the resident
	Indian population. Moreover, the Colony will learn by experience the
	economic value of Indian labour. Ruskin has somewhere said that man,
	as an economic factor, is not be studied simply as a machine, but
	has to be taken with all his mental attributes. Considered as such,
	we believe that the Indian is the most efficient labourer in the
	world. He may be puny, he may be slow, he may be weak, but he is
	most sober, uncomplaining, patient, and long- suffering. He,
	therefore, gives no trouble to his masters, and is a reliable
	worker. If some other labour were introduced, if only tempo- rarily,
	all the attributes we have mentioned as specially belonging to the
	Indian will be appreciated, and he will be prized on that account.
	But as long as the Colony must have Indian labour, it must be
	satisfied with the restrictions it has already secured, without
	adding to them the humiliating one of compelling every Indian to
	carry passes. Mr. McCrystal incidentally said that most of the
	Asiatic were not British subjects, but Arabians. Some Indians do
	indeed call  themselves Arabian merchants, but there is no excuse
	for the gentleman betraying the ignorance he has. The term âArabianâ
	has come to be used in this Colony synonymously with Mahomedan, for
	the reason that the Moslem faith has its rise in Arabia.</p>

	The other matter dealt with by the Conference was the shortage of
	labour supply. On the one hand, then, the Conference wanted fur-
	ther restrictions on the Indians; on the other, it complained of the
	paucity of labourers. Even India has its limitations and we must not</p>

suppose that it is an inexhaustible field for recruiting labour.
There is a vast system of inland immigration in India itself where
there is a continuous stream flowing towards Burma and Singapore. Add
to this the other Colonies, including Ceylon, Mauritius, and Fiji.
Natal is only one of the many competitors moving<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
     </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>the
Indian labourer. It must not, therefore, be surprised if it finds
itself handicapped owing to excessive restrictions imposed on the
labourers. We have no doubt that the new Immigration Act, which
imposes an annual tax of Â£3 on the indentured men and their children
after they have regained their free- dom, has a considerable effect
on the supply. The  Colony  wants Indian labour, and yet wishes to
avoid many of its natural consequen- ces. It is, to our mind, this
anomalous position which comes in the way more than the requirements
as to the percentage of women to accom- pany the immigrants, as some
speakers at the meeting supposed.</p>

The so-called Asiatic National Convention in the Transvaal will have
to be held, if it is held at all, without Johannesburg being repres-
ented. It will be a case of <i>Hamlet </i>being played without
Hamlet. Both the Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Trade in the
âgolden cityâ have declined to associate themselves with a
convention whose object, in the words of Mr. Mitchell, is to
confiscate the property of inoffensive people. The resolutions
submitted by the conveners of the convention, the Chambers contend,
are too drastic to be acceptable to a British community in that they
contemplate forcible removal of British Indian traders to Bazaars
without compensation, and take no notice of vested interests. The
pill offered by Messrs. Bourke and Loveday is too strong even for the
Potchefstroom Vigilance Asso- ciation, which, as our readers are
aware, was violently hostile to the Indians when the Blue book on the
Indian question was given to the public. We venture to offer our
congratulations to the two Chambers and the Potchefstroom Association
for daring to be just. It is a relief to recognise, amid the heap of
blind, unreasoning prejudice, sober views and sentiments expressed by
representative bodies. A little more patience, a little more time,
and perfect equanimity on the part of the British Indians will, we
doubt not, do the rest. Unwearied reiteration is, as the late
Professor Max Muller used to say, the only remedy for</p>

The Johannesburg newspapers publish the interesting corres- pondence
between His Excellency the High Commissioner and the Rand Pioneers on
the subject of the Natives of the Transvaal travel- ling first and
second class on the Central South African Railways. Lord Milner has
assured the Rand Pioneers that henceforth no Natives, except those
holding certificates of exemption, will be allowed  to travel first
or second class on the railways, and that the inspectors and
station-masters have been instructed to separate Coloured passengers
from the white passengers. The Rand Pioneers have restricted their
demands only to the Natives, but the instructions issued by Mr.
Price, the General Manager, cover all the Coloured people, including
British Indians, although it is some satisfaction to learn that 
respectable  British Indians are to be allowed first or second-class
tickets without difficulty. Special coaches for Coloured passengers
are to be joined to the Pretoria-Pietersburg line as an experiment.
This is one of the instances how a mountain can be made out of a
mole-hill, and if separate carriages are to be provided for different
races, logically, there should be compartments for Natives, Chinese,
British Indians, Cape Coloured people, Boers, Englishmen, Germans,
and so on. It would, indeed, then be a question as to how to make the
line pay, but that would be a very small affair compared to the
respect that has to be paid to sentiment in the Transvaal, whether
such sentiment be reasonable or otherwise. Joking apart, however, if
the distinction is to be drawn, we imagine that it will be necessary
to have three distinct compartments, namely, for Europeans, Natives
and Asiatics. The circular issued by the General Manager is a
veritable hornetâs nest, and we are quite sure that we have not
heard the last of it. The Rand Pioneers have already notified their
dissatisfaction, and they do not believe in the Natives of the
Transvaal being allowed to travel first or</p>

It was illuminated on vellum, and Miss Ada M.  Bissicks,  in whose
hands the work was placed, thought out quite an original design for
it. The whole of the left side of the address is taken up with a
faithful representation of that most exquisite bird, the peacock of
India. The lettering is also very chaste, and the whole illumination
is a work of art. The address was enclosed in a solid silver casket,
with lotus flowers engraved on it. Both the address and the casket
were worthy of the distinguished recipient and the Indian community.</p>

By the time this is in print, the so-called National Convention in
the Transvaal will have been held. The representative Associations in
Johannesburg have now decided to send their delegates, and Messrs.
Bourke and Loveday have accepted the amendments suggested by the
former. The resolutions, therefore, embody the principle of compen-
sation, but in our opinion, all the amendments put together mean very
little indeed. Previous experience warns us against expecting
anything from the adoption of such a principle. The Asiatic
Commission that was appointed and which, happily, owing to the Test
case of <i>Habib </i><i>Motan </i>v. <i>The </i><i>Government</i>,
proved abortive, as may be recollected, rejected the claims of all
those who were engaged in trade immedia- tely before the outbreak of
hostilities. The Potchefstroom people have made it pretty clear that,
according to their notion, compensation should be restricted only to
those who at the outbreak of war held licenses to trade outside
Locations. To us, therefore, the idea of com- pensation means little
or nothing. What is, then, to be the upshot of all this anti-Indian
agitation? If the dictation of the National Convention  is to carry
the day, we know the result. Every self-respecting British Indian
must then be prepared to face the inevitable and leave the country.
That is to say, he must be an outcast in his own home. He has been
taught from his childhood by, very often, his English school-
masters, out of books printed and published under British
supervision, that the long arm of the British Government protects the
weak against the strong. As the late Poet Laureate<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
Gujarat sang,âLo! the enmi- ties have died out, the doers of black
deeds are for ever crushed and (under the British Government) no one
twists even the ear of a lambâ. He has been taught also that, in
places which are included within the Dominions of the King-Emperor,
every one of his subjects enjoys the fullest liberty and all civil
rights, so much so, that even the shackles of foreigners fall off on
British soil. If, as we say, the National Con- vention carries the
day, the Indian must unlearn all this, the slate must be wiped clean,
he must forget all that he has hitherto regar-ded as beautiful in the
English constitution, and he must be content to see the means of his
livelihood taken away from his mouth. But we must decline to believe
that any such thing can possibly happen so long as the Transvaal
continues to prize the Union Jack. We cannot conceive that Mr.
Lyttelton is likely to go back upon the policy laid down in</p>

Our London contemporary, <i>India</i>, has fallen into the error of
accepting official figures in connection with this Corps, although it
has in its own files the correct figures. The whole of the
medal-giving regarding this Corps has been unfortunately bungled up.
We may, therefore, state the facts once more for general 
information.  The Corps was formed at first for service at the battle
of Colenso. It then consisted of over 25 leaders, not <i>sirdars</i>,
and over 600 bearers. The leaders did not receive any pay
whatsoever<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>even their uniforms
were paid for by the Indian merchants. After a short service, the
Corps was disbanded. When the first move to Spion Kop was attempted,
Colonel Gallwey ordered that the Corps should be re-formed. There
were  about 30 leaders and at least 1,100 to 1,200 bearers. The Corps
was  on active service this time for 6 weeks and performed surprising
mar- ches, doing as much as 25 miles per day, carrying the wounded.
Its work has been specially mentioned by General Buller in his
dispat- ches. Why only eight clasps have been distributed no one
knows. Everyone of the leaders is entitled to them, and if the War
Office in- tends to distribute medals among the men, as it certainly
ought to, we would undertake to find almost all of them. A complete
record was then kept of the names of the bearers, together with their
addresses, and it should be in possession of the Superintendent of
the Corps. We have not said much about the manner in which the medals
have been distributed, because we are anxious that the leaders  who 
worked should not connect themselves with any reward. They undertook
the work as a labour of duty, pure and simple, and they should be
ever ready to take such duty up again, irrespective of recognition of
merit.</p>

We tender our respectful and loyal congratulations to His Majesty the
King-Emperor on his birthday. His Majesty completed his 63rd year on
Wednesday last, and there went up from one end of the Empire to the
other the prayer that he might have many happy returns of the day. Of
all the European monarchs, there is none that fulfils the ideal as
King Edward does. Recognising the limits of a constitutional
monarchy, he yet has proved that he can render to  the  Empire
immense service by his tact and gentleness. His work in France, his
visit to the Pope, his meeting with the Kaiser<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>all
these have promoted the cause of peace. It is an open secret that His

followed by the Government as well as the people in the Orange River
Colony. We publish elsewhere some extracts which show in what manner
the Indian is being hunted down. It would appear that, not being
satisfied with insisting on the declaration of the Indian desiring to
settle in the Colony that he will always during his stay remain in
service under someone or other, the Government now insists on his
making a fresh declaration each time that he changes masters or the
nature of his work, and then, it would depend entirely on the will of
the authorities as to whether he should stay in the Colony or not. A
situation such as this requires prompt ending or mending. We have
often drawn attention to the drastic legislation in the Colony
against Asiatics, but we have seen hitherto no relief being granted.
Are we to understand that this humiliating treatment of British
Indians in the Orange River Colony is to be perpetuated, and that the
India Office is to sit still ?</p>

Sir Henry Bale the other day remarked that the Indians entering the
Court-house were seemingly disrespectful, in that they did not shew
any outward mark of respect to the Court. The turbans or the caps
they would not take off, because of their custom to the contrary, and
the boots could not be taken off, because  it  would  be inconvenient
to do so. His Lordship ruled that, unless every Indian on entering
the Court salaamed, the omission would be treated  as contempt of
Court. We respectfully draw His Lordshipâs attention to the fact
that the very wearing of the turban or the Indian cap implies a mark
of respect, for just as on entering a place the European custom
requires the taking <i>off </i>of the hat, Indian custom requires
that the turban and the cap, as the case may be, should be kept on.
Want of respect is not an Indian characteristic, and we venture to
assure His Lordship that in the omission to salaam there can be no
disrespect meant. The salaaming presupposes the meeting of the eyes
of the person salaamed and the person salaaming, which is hardly
possible in a Court-house where the judge is absorbed in the case
before him. The only feasible course, in our opinion, is that, on
enterning the witness-box, the Indian should certainly be made to
salaam, but we think that such a caution is hardly necessary, as
every Indian on entering the witness-box almost instinctively offers
the respect due to the Court. However, it is as well for the Indian
litigant who may have occasion to visit the Courts to bear in mind
the requirements laid down by His Lordship. We must not, under any
circumstances, allow ourselves to be even suspected of any disrespect
to the judges or other authorities.</p>

regard to the introduction of Asiatics into the Colony, this is a
very delicate question for me to touch upon as there is considerable
feeling amongst our people at Home in regard to British Indians, but
at present I may say there will be no alteration in the legislation
from that adopted by the late Government, nor do we contemplate at

We were profoundly grieved to read the news of the death, on
Wednesday afternoon, of H.E. Lord Northbrooke. We have been familiar
with his name for years now. Lord Northbrooke succeeded Lord Mayo as
Viceroy and Governor-General of India after the  latterâs
assassination. Two memorable and historic events took place during
his viceroyalty: the Prince of Walesâ tour of India<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>We
mourn him especially because Lord Northbrooke had great sympathy for
us. He proffered excellent advice and even extended help, whenever

As we expected, Mr. Hoondamal has won his appeal, and we congratulate
both him and his counsel, Mr. Binns, on the victory. It is, however,
quite clear from the learned Chief Justiceâs judgment that the
struggle is by no means over. The appeal has been decided practi-
cally on a side issue. The judge held that Mr. Hoondamal was wrongly
summoned for trading without a license because he held one, but
declined to decide upon the issue raised in the appeal as to whether
the Licensing Officer had the right to restrict trade to any
particular locality. Therefore, the Indian community has to approach
the new year with a great deal of anxiety and fear. Such a state of
things ought not to be allowed to last in a British Colony, and we
trust that before long the law will be amended. The late Mr. Escombe
said that he gave wide powers to the Town Council because he had
faith in their moderation. The Corporation of Durban has, we are
sorry to say, on more than one occasion, belied those expectations,
and if the pre-mier Corporation in this Colony has not been able to
justify them, what is to be expected from lesser bodies? Everyone
recongnises that the Dealersâ Licences Act is a terrible engine of
oppression May we not, then, appeal to our legislators to take the
temptation away from the local authorities? It would be perfectly
possible even then to regulate and control the issuing of licences,
and probably in a far more satisfactory manner. Another thought that
arises from the appeal is that, in spite of his victory, Mr.
Hoondamal comes off second best. He has been put to enormous expense
simply because of the vagaries of the prosecution and, may we say
with deference, the hasty judg- ment of the Magistrate. It is
admitted that the prosecution was wrongly brought, and yet Mr.
Hoondamal has to pay for this mistake. The struggle is unequal and
the pecuniary aspect of it should never be lost sight of. The least
that the Town Council may be expected to do is to</p>

The Anti-Asiatic Convention, held at Pretoria on the 10th ins- tant,
has produced some remarkable results probably never anticipated by
its authors. With the exception of a few newspapers, even the South
African Press has condemned its proceedings as arbitrary and unjust.
The London <i>Times </i>, which gave the lead, said that they
betrayed lack of statesmanship on the part of the delegates, and
added that agitation of that nature, however violent, could not be
allowed to override Imperial obligations, and that the proposals laid
down by Mr. Lyttel- ton in his dispatch on the question could not be
departed from to the detriment of the British Indians. We have read
all the reports about the Convention, and what has grieved us most is
the fact that, if they are a fair summary of the proceedings, they
show, shall we say, an utter lack of knowledge on the part of the
speakers. Wildest statements were made regarding British Indians, as
also the intentions of the Imperial Government. We hear that the
speeches made were most inflamma- tory, and that the reporters have
considerably toned them down. We are told that some of the speakers
even hurled defiance at the Imperial Government. Now, just as, as
between the Europeans and the Indians, it is admitted that the former
should remain the predominant partner, is it not a fact that, as
between the Imperial Government and the Colonies, the former has the
dominant voice? If the members of the Convention claim that they must
have all they want, as was said by one of the Boer delegates, it
opens out a most serious question as to the value of the tie wherein
one party must have all, and the other must give all. The Empire has
been built up as it is on a foundation of justice and equity. It has
earned a would-wide reputation for  its anxiety and ability to
protect the weak against the strong. It is the acts of peace and
mercy, rather than those of war, that have made it what it is, and we
make bold to say that the members of the Convention are much
mistaken, if they think that, for their selfish ends, the established
policy of the Imperial Government is going to be suddenly changed,</p>

and that an act of spoliation, as Mr. Quinn termed it, would be
commi- tted by the Imperial Government at their bidding. Though,
therefore, the violent proceedings of the Convention. need cause no
fear among the British Indians, it was well that the British Indian
Association pro- mptly convened a public meeting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
Indians throughout the Colony, in order to consider the proceedings
of the Convention.  The  full report we published last week shows
that the meeting was very largely attended, that representatives went
to it from all parts of the Colony, and that the proceedings were
quite moderate, though, at the same time, sufficiently emphatic. Mr.
Abdool Gani made it clear in his speech that the gathering at
Pretoria assumed a state of things that never existed and then
proceeded to apply a remedy. It was well, too, that he laid stress
upon the fact that the distinction between British subjects and
non-British subjects was entirely disregarded by the Convention, as
also the distinction between the natives of South Africa and the
British Indians. More harm has been done to the Indians by
overlooking these two fundamental facts than [by] anythings else. It
may suit those gentlemen, whose interest lies in driving the Indian
out of the Transvaal, to confuse the real issue by including the
Indian among all the Asiatics, and then bracketing the latter with
the natives of South Africa. They have some justification for doing
so, as even Sir Arthur Lawley in his despatch has succumbed to this
view, but we trust that now that the real intentions of the majority
of those who attended the Convention are made clearly known, we would
have the distinction Mr. Abdool Gani has insisted upon drawn by the
authori- ties at Home. We commend to their attention also the
proposals of the British Indian Association reiterated at the
meeting. They offer at once a complete and, if we may say so, a
statesmanlike solution of the intricate question.</p>

once the strength and the weakness of the British Constitution that
nothing can be done under it, not even if it be clearly in the public
interest, except under legal authority. The Johannesburg Plague Com-
mittee find that, whether plague breaks out in this place or not,
they are not authorised by law to apply, what Mr. Quinn has termed,
the fire cure, and that therefore, Johannesburg must run  the  risk 
of another outbreak during the rainy weather. We hope that a remedy
for this difficult position will be found, and that the area within
Ferre- iras Township will be quickly dealt with, as it should be. The
figures given by Dr. Porter provide food for interesting study. The
popula- tion of the whole area is 288 Indians, 58 Syrians, 165
Chinese, 297 Cape, 75 Kaffirs and 929 whites. Of these, the
Insanitary Area proper contains the following distribution according
to Dr. Porter: Indians 255, Syrians 17, Chinese 126, Cape 192,
Kaffirs 31 and whites 241. Thus we see that the lowest class in all
the communities is more or less the same. We think, however, that the
real culprits are the landlords. So long as they get a fat rent, they
do not mind in the slightest degree what happens to the poor tenants
or how they live, and the landlords, have been able to perform a
blood-sucking operation, because of the laches of the Johannesburg
Town council, which might have dealt with the place long ago. It is
worthy of note that the landlords in this conn- ection are not
Indians at all but Europeans. Not that by making this statement we
wish to imply any particular merit in the  Indian landlords of the
same class as the European landlords who infest Ferreiras Township.
It is merely a proof of human nature being more or less alike,
whether it is covered by a white skin or a brown skin.</p>

is temporary, but the notice bears some meaning which is ominous. Why
the poor people should be driven from pillar to post,  it  is
difficult to understand. The condition of the Location is unexcep-
tionable, it is not overcrowded, and is isolated from the town. The
people have been allowed to live there prior to the war, and what the
Republican Government never did, or could do, is now being threat-
ened or done under the British Government. Although all such ten-
dancies were, during the late Mr. Krugerâs regime, temporary,
nobody ever thought of disturbing the tenantâs occupation. The
Notice does not say that the people will have to remove at a definite
time, but warns them against building permanent structures. Many
Indians, wishing to live better, have begun to erect suitable
buildings, and the Notice is the result. Thus, conditions
unfavourable to the better mode of life are artificially created, and
then the people who have to labour under such disabilities are blamed
for any results that flow therefrom. The Boksburg Vigilants will
still be able to point the finger of scorn and say the Indians do not
spend on building, and do not live in decent style, forgetting that
they are in that position by force of circumstances. When will such
an ominous situation end? Even if the Government intend to remove the
people, why should it be impossible to give them a clear, long,
definite notice? What do they propose to do with reference to those
who, before the Notice, had already built expensive premises? We
appeal to the Government for justice and fair play.</p>

Now, this kind of argument is very seductive. The writer has
evidently overlooked some important facts, as also the exprience of
history. We have it on Mr. Lytteltonâs authority that South Africa
is not the white manâs country, and so long as the great numerical
inequality between the Europeans and the Kaffirs continues to remain
in favour of the latter, it is passing strange how any man could call
South Africa a white manâs country. Mr. Lyttelton, only the other
day, said that, had it not been so, he would never have consented to
introduce the chinese into the Transvaal. It cannot be denied that,
rightly or wrongly, the white man wishes to begin and end as a boss
in South Africa. He would not perform manual work. Under the
circumstances, the Kaffirs must play a very important part in the
economy of South Africa, and so long as such a condition of affairs
prevails in South Africa, the brown man must find a place. Had it not
been so, he would certainly never have come to South Africa. The
writer has instanced East Africa to show how it has been overrun by</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Indians. The statement is mis-leading in that it is not true in the
manner it is intended. That is to say, there has been no displacement
of the white man by the Indian in East Africa. There the nature of
the climate and the soil has failed to attract white settlers, and so
the Indian has been encouraged to develop the country. The praise
showered on the Indians by the writer is flattering to the Indian
mind, but it is utterly misleading. We would indeed wish that all the
praise was well deserved. While there is a great deal of truth in it,
we must confess that, when the Europeans and the Indians have come in
contact, the former have shown superior organising ability, probably
superior communal spirit, and superior foresight. The result is that
the Indian has occupied, as a class, a subordinate position. Why has
not the writer taken Europe first as an example? There Indian
immigration is totally unrestricted, and yet the Indian has not been
able to displace a single white man. The reason is obvious. There is
no use or demand for him there. In South Africa, on the other hand,
there are things which the white man would not do, and the Kaffir
could not do. It has, therefore, been possible for the Indians to
live in South Africa. There may be overlapping in some instances, but
as a rule each of the races has found its own level and its vocation.
It is to our mind preposterous for any one to contend that there is
any grave danger in the Indian displacing the white man. Alarming
arguments such as the one under review are calculated to confuse the
real issue and to retard a reasonable solution of the problem. It is
the province of prudence to anticipate the future and provide for or
against it. But it is prudence run amuck to assume danger where there
is none. No one has contended that immigration from Asia or, for that
matter, from any part of the world, should be totally unrestricted in
South Africa. Reasonable restrictions have been proposed, and if they
have not been carried out, it is simply the fault of the people who
share the views expressed by the Anglo-Indian, who, of all the people
in the world, must know, having lived in India, that the danger
foretold in his article is a mere phantom.</p>

Your Petitioner begs respectfully to approach Your Excellency in
connection with certain British Indian claims filed with the Rand
Plague Committee in respect of goods destroyed at the instance of the
Committee during the outbreak of the bubonic plague in the Colony
this year.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 95%">
After the discovery of the plague in the late Indian Location at
Johannesburg, its inhabitants were cordoned [off] for a few days and
subsequently removed to an isolation camp at Klipspruit. The removal
to Klipspruit was effected on very short notice. When the inhabitants
of the Location removed to Klipspruit, they were, as a rule,
prevented from taking with them anything beyond their beddings. All
their valuables, furniture and even bedsteads were ordered to be left
behind.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 95%">
On the people protesting, they were assured by Dr.Pakes, the Special
Plague Officer, that all the goods destroyed should be paid for by
the Committee, and that, therefore, the Indians need not have any
anxiety. It was on this understanding that the Indians removed to
Klipspruit without taking anything with them. Even the domestic ani-
mals, such as the dogs and cats, were ordered to be destroyed, in
spite of the protests made by the owners; so, too, were most of the
birds. In spite of the assurance given by Dr, Pakes, the Rand Plague
Committee has repudiated its liability in the matter on the ground
stated in its letters to the claimants. The Assistant Secretary of
the Committee in repudiating the claims writes as follows:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.88cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 105%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">I
am directed to advise you that, acting on the opinion of Council, the
Committee cannot accept liability for payment of the amount. In terms
of the Plague regulations, any articles which are likely to be or
become infected with, or spread infection of bubonic or oriental
plague, may be disinfected, and in case, disinfection is impossible
for any reason, may be destroyed, and the Committee are advised that
no compensation is payable in respect of any</font></font></p>

My Association respectfully submits that, irrespective  of the legal
position of the Committee, it is morally bound to respect the pli-
ghted word of its only Officer who was at the critical time
responsi-ble for the public safety. Had no such promise been made, it
is doubtful whether the inhabitants of the Location would have left
their belong- ings as they did, without a murmur, in order to carry
out the wishes of the Special Plague Officer. Among the goods
destroyed were whole bags full of dry cereals and pulses and tinned
foods which, according to the Vienna Convention, have been held not
to carry infection.  There was also household furniture, both wooden
and metallic, des- troyed. It could not be said that such articles
were incapable of disinfection.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
After protracted negotiations, the Committee has seen its way to
accept claims for goods actually used by it out of the Location
stores. At one time, even these claims were practically repudiated.
It has been admitted that the goods that were used were of the same
class as some of the stable goods that have been destroyed. The
reason given for destroying the other eatables, instead of using
them, is that it was the intention of the Committee to avoid among
the inmates of the isola- tion camp the possibility of the slightest
risk of infection. As a matter of fact, some goods were even sent to
Klipspruit. The inmates them- selves were quite willing to use up the
stores that were in the Location.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
It is worthy of note that the distribution of the orders for goods
was by no means even or impartial, the purchase by the Committee
being mostly confined to a few store-keepers only. Thus, it has hap-
pened that, while a few luckly men who were able to get rid of all
their stores in so far as their claims are confined to stores have
received full payment, their less fortunate brethren have received
little or nothing.</p>

Many inhabitants have, by reason of such wholesale destruction of
their goods, become practically penniless.</p>

My Association, therefore, humbly ventures to approach Your
Excellency for intervention and trusts that Your Excellency will be
pleased to secure a favourable consideration of the claims of the
inha- bitants of the late Indian Location for the value of their
goods which were destroyed under orders of the Rand Plague Committee.</p>

glad to admit the correction. If, on the other hand, they cannot be
challenged, and if you think that my statement has been verified, I
hope you will be good enough to collect the sum of Â£50 from Mr.
Kleinenberg and hand it to the Nazareth House. One word more and I
have finished. My object in troubling you is merely to place the
truth and nothing but the truth before the public. Mr. Kleinenberg is
well known to the British Indians in Pietersburg. I doubt not that he
is guided by honest motives, and it is because I feel that want of
infor- mation is the greatest mischief-maker in this controversy,
that my Association has felt it to be its duty to take up statements
made at the National Convention and refute them, wherever it was

We reproduce in another column the petition of the British Indian
Association addressed to the Acting Lieutenant-Governor,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>with
reference to certain claims filed with the Rand Plague Committee for
goods that were destroyed on its instructions, on the outbreak of the
plague in Johannesburg in March last. The petition discloses a story
of meanness and callous disregard of all moral obligations on the
part of the Rand Plague Committee. According to the petitionerâs
version, before the goods were destroyed, Dr. Pakes had made a
definite promise that compensation would be given to the owners, and
if it be true that furniture, metallic things, and whole bags of dry
food were burnt down, the destruction must have been more in order to
fire public imagination and to conciliate sentiment than to guard
against danger to public health. It would be monstrous to suppose
that iron bedsteads or even wooden furniture could not be properly
disinfected. It will be remembered that, when the plague outbreak
took place first in Natal, the Natal Government sounded the views of
the Indian Government as to the ability of rice and such other
food-stuffs to</p>

carry infection, and the expert opinion sent by the Government of
India was that there was no danger in receiving rice bags and such
other foods from even plague-infected districts in India. Again, the
inmates themselves, it would appear, were quite willing to have the
eatables found in the Location served out to them. We, however, very
much question whether public safety was at all advanced by the
wholesale destruction of the goods. Be that, however, as it may, if
the Rand Plague Committee chose to have the luxury of burning down
the belongings of the poor men, it cannot escape liability to pay for
them. The attempt to avoid payment under legal protection in the
circumstances above mentioned is, in our humble opinion, simply
scandalous. We must repeat for the tenth time that it was due to the
gross neglect of the Johannesburg Municipality that the plague broke
out. The Indians, it is admitted, behaved during that critical time
in a most exemplary manner. Relying on promises made by its
responsible officer, they quietly moved away to Klipspruit with the
quickest dis- patch, and without giving the authorities the slightest
trouble. Repu- diation of the just claims of such people is
tantamount to an unwar- ranted confiscation of their property. To
saddle the few men, who had the ill-luck to be in the Location at the
time the cordon was drawn round, with the loss of all they possessed
is a heartless procedure un- worthy of a great corporation like the
Rand Plague Committee. Those who went out to Klipspruit, and were
practically kept under restraint, and were prevented from following
their daily vocation, deserve sym- pathy and better treatment, and we
hope that His Excellency will give careful consideration to Mr. Abdul
Ganiâs petition, and do justice to the British Indians by ordering
payment of compensation.</p>

Mr. Kleinenberg, of Pietersburg, has written to <i>The Star</i>,
chall- enging the statement made by Mr. Abdul Gani regarding the
number of Indian traders in Pietersburg before and after the war in
the course of his address to the recently held mass meeting at
Johannesburg. In support of his statement, Mr. Kleinenberg produced
certain figures, and triumphantly declared that, if they could be
disproved, he would forfeit to the Nazareth House the sum of Â£ 50,
provided that a like sum is forfeited by the other party, in the
event of his figures being proved true. Mr. Abdul Gani has written to
<i>The Star</i>, promptly taking up the challenge. We are surprised
that, with Mr. Kleinenbergâs experience, he should have allowed
himself to be misled by the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always"><a name="110. LETTER TO DADABHAI NAOROJI"></a>
figures supplied to him. Indeed, if the number of licenses issued to
British Indian traders before the war were any test of the actual
number that carried on trade, we would find that there were hardly
100 Indian traders in the Transvaal, whereas everybody who knows
anything about the country knows that there were far more than 100
British Indian traders carrying on trade in the Transvaal before war
outside Locations. Such a state of things was possible because of the
strong hand of the British Agent affording protection to unlicensed
Indian traders. The incident thus shows the proof of the statement,
made at the Indian meeting, about the best men in the Colony in the
Transvaal being ill-informed and not studying their facts well before
forming their judgment. Mr. Kleinenberg, again, forgets that the
number of Indian licenses supplied to him by the Revenue Office in-
cludes Indians trading in the Locations at Pietersburg of which there
is a large number. Now the Indians who are trading in Location do not
enter into the controversy at all. The proceedings of the Convention
were directed against trades established outside Locations or
Bazaars. We hope, then, that either Mr. Kleinenberg will acknowledge
his mis- take as an act of fairness and justice or proceed to
substantiate his pro- position, if he does not accept the explanation
offered by Mr. Abdul Gani.</p>

Now the Kaffir Market is an eyesore which has nothing to recommend
it; and it has to be dealt with on its own merits. But it would not
be proper to blame the whole community for the obstinacy of an
individual. Nor is it right to suggest that there is any idea of
determined opposition to the reasonable wishes of the burgesses. We
admit that the transfers of licences should be regulated. But, in the</p>

present case, we consider that the action of the Town Council is
high- handed, prejudiced, oppressive and unjust. Mr. Hoondamal has an
exceedingly strong case on merits. His premises are in excellent con-
dition, comparing most favourably with the best of the class in West
Street. He is a man of exceptionally clean habits. His trade is high-
class European, and commands the confidence of a large number of
European houses. Law seems to be on his side. Why, then, should he
not fight for what he is justly entitled to? And, if, against the
whole weight of the Town Council, which is thrown against him in an
unjust manner, the Indians in general rally round the oppressed
merchant, it is nothing but their duty so to do. And we think that
our contempo- rary should appreciate rather than deprecate the
efforts on the part of the Indians to secure justice. When that
proposition has been made good, it would be time to appeal to the
Indians to respect the wishes of the Town Council.</p>

discussion a tendency to bring in the Indian question. But a little
reflection would show that the Indian question has nothing to do with
it. It is true that the upper landlord is an Indian. It will be
remembered that there were two such markets. One of the landlords,
Mr. Omar Haji Amod, as soon as the nuisance was brought to his
notice, summarily stopped the Market. That shows the better side of
Indian nature. The other landlord is obdurate; and the Town Council
must find some way to meet the difficulty. But it may be well to
remember that the place is let to European who are managing the
Market. It is a question for each community to use the ordinary
social pressure, supplemented by law, if necessary. The Indians, as a
class, have no more to do with the evil than the Europeans; and it
will facilitate the smooth working of the social machinery if this
fact is borne in mind, and kept clear of other racial questions that
have no bearing on this matter.</p>

We print elsewhere a report from the <i>Witness </i>representative on
the condition of the indentured labour on the coal-mines in Natal. If
the allegations are true, they reveal a shocking state of things. Our
contemporary demands an inquiry. We join in the request. It should be
welcomed by the mine-owners. But if an investigation is held, we
trust that it will be open, public and absolutely impartial. The
commis- sion, in order to command confidence, should be
preponderatingly non-official; and, if we may venture to say so,
should include an Indian gentleman of standing. The general condition
of the inden- tured labourer in the Colony is satisfactory; and it
can only enhance its reputation if causes even for suspicion are
removed.</p>

Now, neither the Home nor the Transvaal Government has decided that

There is no Labour Importation Ordinance passed âregulating the

the 11th day of February, this year, an Ordinance, No.17 of 1904, was
assented toâto regulate the introduction into the Transvaal of
unskilled non-European labourersâ. That is a very diffe- rent

So that not only do the provisions of this Ordinance refer only
toâunskilledânon-European labour; and not only are British Indian
labourers expressly said to be outside of the working of the Ordina-
nce; but it will be necessary for special regulations to be passed by
the Legislative Council dealing with their particular case. Further,
the expression âunrestricted immigration of British  Indiansâ 
assumes that Indians have been entering the country on a large scale.
The fact is that the immigration of British Indians has been almost
entirely stop-ped, except for those who are <i>bonafide</i><i>
</i>refugees.</p>

	May I venture to trespass on your courtesy with reference to a
	venomous attack made by Mr. Loveday, M.L.C., on  the  British
	Indians, when he delivered his address to the anti-Asiatic meeting
	held at Potchefstroom on Saturday last. Mr. Loveday condescended to
	reply to my address to the Indian mass meeting,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
	 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and,
	in the course of his heated remarks, allowed himself to descend to
	abuse and state- ments, the recklessness of which I have never seen
	surpassed in a person holding the responsible position of Mr.
	Loveday. He has not hesitated to charge me with having made
	âdeliberate, wilful, and wickedly false statements, and Oriental
	duplicityâ. However, I have no wish to descend to Mr. Lovedayâs
	level, but I repeat again every statement that I have made in my
	address, and withdraw nothing, and with your permission, I would
	endeavour to give some of the many proofs in support thereof. Mr.
	Loveday resents that portion of the address wherein I have
	complained that he omitted to state at the National Convension, when
	he was giving the history of the Con- vention of 1884, the fact that
	there were at the time British Indians in the Colony, and that Law 3
	of 1885 was passed on misrepresentation. If you and your
	contemporaries reported the honourable gentleman at all correctly,
	my assertion is perfectly true. Mr. Loveday is reported in <i>The
	Star </i>to have said as follows:</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">When
the 1881 Convention was concluded, there were no Indians in the
Transvaal, and there is little or no doubt that the Asiatic side of
the question never presented itself to the authors of that document
sitting in Pretoria, and a study of the whole of the provisions of
that document clearly shows that the white race and the natives
resident in the country alone, were contemplated. It was only after
the arrival of the first Indian traders, and after the 1884
Convention had been substituted for that of 1881, that restrictive
legislation was proposed.</font></font></p>

Thus, Mr. Loveday, if he is correctly reported, has contended that,
as no Indians had arrived before 1884, the words âother than
Nativesâ could apply only to the Europeans, whereas the fact is
that there were already Indian settlers in the country before the
Convention of 1884 was passed. I have taken the trouble of comparing
your report with that of the other newspapers, and it is
substantially the same. So far, therefore, as I am concerned, my
complaint, that Mr. Loveday omitted a material fact in stating the
history of the question, is completely justified. As to the
misrepresen- tations on which Law 3 of 1885 was passed, I quote the
following from one of the several petitions that were used by the 
late Government in order to induce the British Government to sanction
legislation embodied in Law 3 of 1885:</p>

These petitions were signed by responsible and representative men,
and it was due to these gross, unfair, and untrue statements that Law
3 of 1885 was accepted. Mr. Loveday has thought fit again to
reiterate his statement that an Arab tradesman spends not more than Â£
40 per annum. He has quoted the report of the Asiatic Tradersâ
Commission in support, but the Commissioners have said no such thing.
At Potchefstroom, he was more emphatic. I, therefore, again deny the
assertion, and can only state that I ought to know better than Mr.
Loveday as to how much an Indian trandesman spends. Some have to pay
in rent alone even as much as Â£40, not per annum, but per month.
Does Mr. Loveday know a single Indian trader? Has he ever examined
their books? Has he studied the report of the Asiatic Commission?
Will he now go through the books of 20 Indian traders, which I shall
have much pleasure in submitting to him? I deny the statement that
the Indian employees do not receive more than 20s. per</p>

month, and I am in a position to place before him names of Indian
employees receiving more than Â£100 per annum over and above their
board and lodging expenses. Mr. Loveday again states that my
statement, that no new Indians were allowed to come into the country,
was âwickedly falseâ. If I have erred, I have erred in the
company of the Chief Secretary for Permits, who, you will recollect,
only a few months ago, reported to Lord Milner that no new  Indians 
were allowed to enter the Colony, and that permits were only
sparingly granted to <i>bona-fide </i>refugees. Mr. Loveday, in
refutation of the statement, cited Pretoria and Potchefstroom, and he
 says  the population of the Indian Location at Pretoria had been
doubled since the war, and, whereas before there were from 15 to 20
traders, there are now between 90 and 100. This is utterly without
foundation. The Indian population of Pretoria has certainly
increased, but not doubled. The increase is due to the influx of
Indians from other parts of the Colony, who are unable to get
licences or otherwise to get a living. According to the Permits
Officer, there are in the Colony not more than 10,000 Indians. There
were in 1896 nearly 10,000 Indians in the Transvaal, and it will not
be doubted that the Indian population had increased considerably in
1899.âIn Pietersburg,âthe honourable gentleman says,âprior to
the war, they had 13 Indian stores; today they had 49â. As against
that, I venture to state that there were 23 Indian stores before the
war in the town alone, and that there are to day 28. Then, again, Mr.
Loveday has stated:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: -0.07cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The
Indians had told them that they had certain rights, what they called
their âCharter of Libertyâ, but was there any social intercourse
between Indians and whites in India? None whatever.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0cm; line-height: 102%">
The question is gratuitously brought up. The Indians have never
clai-med any social intercourse here. All they have claimed is the
elemen-tary right of reasonable facilities of trading, reasonable
facilities for immigration under general restrictions, freedom of
locomotion and of ownership of property; but, for the information of
Mr. Loveday, I may state there is a measure of social intercourse
also between Indians and Englishmen in India. The balls given by the
Maharaja of Kuch Behar attract the best European society. Functions
and parties are given by the Viceroy and the Governors, where Indians
of all classes are invited. The levees held from time to time in the
chief cities in India are open as well to the Indian subjects as to
the English subjects of the King-Emperor. If I state this fact, I do
so merely to show the lamentable want of knowledge on the part of our
oldest legislator, and not in order to excite the slightest desire on
the part of my country-men for a share in any of the social
functions. We have</p>

no wish to thrust ourselves into the social economy of  the  white
settlers in the Colony. I need hardly go any further with this, to me
a painful subject. It was impossible to allow the honourable
gentlemanâs state-ment at the Potchefstroom meeting to go
unchallenged, but if he has not rendered himself utterly incapable of
seeing things in their true light when the question of colour is
under discussion, I would appeal to his sense of justice and
fairness, and would merely ask him to study his history and his
facts, to study also what I venture to consider are the very
reasonable and moderate propositions of the British Indian
Association and than to ask himself whether he is not wasting his
energy, misleading the people over whom he exercises so much control,
doing an injustice to the responsible position he holds in the
country, and also doing a disservice to the Empire to which he
pro-fesses he is proud to belong.</p>

<i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>enters upon the third stage of its

	The proprietor, being guided by patriotic motives, embarked upon the

	editing of the paper on purely voluntary and unpaid assistance. This
	he readily received. It was his intention to make the paper
	self-supporting by devoting the profits from the general printing to
	meeting the expected deficiency on the paper. But such was not to be
	the case. Although this journal supplied a real want, what may be
	termed a commercial demand had to be created. In other words, the
	paper had not only to find its matter, but its readers also.
	Moreover, the sending of over five hundred com- plimentary copies
	was a great drag. Pecuniary assistance had, there- fore, to be
	called in. The Natal Indian Congress and the British Indian
	Association came to the rescue, and voted certain funds towards the
	payment of the expense of printing and posting the complimentary
	copies.</p>

and wanted more. The situation could only be saved by heroic measu-
res. Patchwork was useless. Palliatives were dangerous. There remain-
ed then an appeal to the devoted workers and friends in favour of
adopting a novel and revolutionary project. They were to look not to
the present but to the future; not to their pockets but to the paper
first. And why not? The object of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>was to
bring the Euro- pean and the Indian subjects of King Edward closer
together. It was to educate public opinion, to remove causes for
misunderstanding; to put before the Indians their own blemishes; and
to show them the path of duty while they insisted on securing their
rights. This was an Imperial and pure ideal, towards the fruition of
which anyone could work unselfishly. So it appealed to some of the
workers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
The plan was shortly this. If a piece of ground sufficiently large
and far away from the hustle of the town could be secured for hous-
ing the plant and machinery, each one of the workers could have his
plot of land on which he could live. This would simplify the question
of living under sanitary and healthy conditions, without heavy expen-
ses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
The workers could receive per month an advance sufficient to cover
necessary expenses, and the whole profits could be divided amongst
them at the end of each year. The management would thus be saved the
necessity of having to find a large sum of money from week to week.
The workers also could have the option of buying out their plot of
land at the actual cost price.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 86%">
Living under such conditions and amid the beautiful surroun- dings
which have given Natal the name of the Garden Colony, the workers
could live a more simple and natural life, and the ideas of Ruskin
and Tolstoy [be] combined with strict business principles. Or, on the
other hand, the workers could reproduce the artificiality of town
life, if it pleased them to do so. One could hope that the spirit of
the scheme and the surroundings would have an educative influence on
them. There would be a closer brotherly combination between the
European and the Indian workers. There was a possibility that the
daily working hours could be reduced. Each could become his own
agriculturist. The English workers could belie the taunt that the
Englishman in South Africa would not cultivate the soil and work with
his own hands. He had here all the facilities for such work, without
any of the drawbacks. The Indian worker could copy his European
brother, and learn the dignity and utility of healthy recreation as
distinguished from constant, slaving toil for miserable gains.</p>

The incentive would be threefold to all: and ideal to work for in the
shape of <i>Indian Opinion</i>; perfectly healthy surroundings to
live in, and an immediate prospect of owning a piece of land on the
most advantageous terms; and a direct tangible interest and
participation in the scheme.</p>

Such in outline was the argument. It has been translated into action.
The printing works have been removed to a large piece of ground near
Phoenix Station, on the North Coast line. There are already
Englishmen and Indians working here under the scheme. It is yet too
early to forecast the result. It is a bold experiment and fraught
with momentous consequences. We know of no non-religious organi-
sation that is or has been managed on the principles above laid down.
If it succeeds, we cannot but think that it would be worthy of imi-
tation. We write impersonally, and no one on the staff of this
journal claims any glory over the matter. We, therefore, think it but
right to take the public into our confidence. Their support would
encourage us very greatly, and no doubt contribute largely to the
success of the scheme. We can appeal to both the great communities
residing in South Africa and trust that they will assist the
management to bring the scheme to the successful issue that we
believe it deserves.</p>

Our contemporary, <i>The Natal Witness</i>, continues to give promi-
nence to the prosecutions that have recently taken place in Ladysmith
for assault on indentured Indians. <i>The Natal Witness </i>is to be
congratu- lated on giving so much as a column-and-a-half, in its
issue of the 16th inst., to the prosecution of a European underground
manager at the Ramsay Collieries for assault on an indentured Indian
employed on the mine. The manager was found guilty. And according to
Sergt. Lempriereâs fearless address for the Crown, the assault was
serious. The story of the alleged sale of a woman which camp up as a
side issue is most discreditable, if it is true. It is a matter for
consolation that we have in the Colony Crown Prosecutors like the
Sergeant, who do not flinch in doing their duty. The whole matter,
however, requires careful investigation by the Government. The
reading of the report of the case leaves a bad taste in the mouth. An
impartial inquiry would bring the truth to light, and it should, as
we have said before, be welcomed by the Collieries Company.</p>

The Potchefstroom Vigilants are going mad again. They want to clear
their town of the Indians entirely. After their first outburst, it
will be remembered, they had cooled down considerably; and, in spite
of the opposition of their friends from Boksburg, they had decided
that compensation should be awarded to those Indians who  might  be
driven to the Bazaar. But they have evidently repented of their mode-
ration. They would now take the law into their hands, and establish
in Potchefstroom a reign of terror. They would disregard the
religious feelings of inoffensive, law-abiding people. They would not
allow an Indian Mosque to be erected in their town. They would make
it hot for all who may have dealings with Indians. The householders
are not to be allowed, on pain of social ostracism, to buy from
Indians; the merchants, similarly, are not to trade with them; and
the landowners are to evict their Indian tenants. From a selfish
standpoint, the Indians ought to welcome such hysterical opposition,
because it is exhausted by its own violence. But from an Imperial
standpoint, the action of the Potchefstroom Vigilants cannot be too
strongly condemned. The his- tory of British rule is the history of
constitutional evolution. Under the British flag, respect for the law
has become a part of the nature of the people. Our friends the
Vigilants are belying their profession of loy- alty to British rule
by treading under foot the very corner-stone of the glorious
constitution which enables them to enjoy freedom of speech as it is
enjoyed nowhere else in the world. They have mistaken liberty for
licentiousness of speech. May we appeal to them for a little sob-
riety?</p>

A merchant who does not take a review of his position from year to
year would be considered a fool. A missionary hymn-book advises us to
âcount our blessings one by oneâ and see how much the Lord has
done for us. We would, therefore, be following a good precedent and

the position of our countrymen in South Africa which has rendered our
existence necessary. We, however, regret that we cannot âcount many

to be satisfied with softening the harsh appearance of the dark
clouds around us by drawing attention to the silver linings here and
there.</p>

To commence with Natal, the position remains much the same as before
so far as new legislation is concerned. But the tendency of the
working of the anti-Asiatic measures has been decidedly towards
restriction bordering often on harshness. The new Immigration Act
continues to give a great deal of trouble to the people. The supervi-
sion of the incoming vessels bringing Indian passengers is far
stricter than it used to be. The interpretation of the term
âdomicileâ has been much narrowed and many deserving Indians,
although they have been in the Colony before, are being shut out. The
Dealersâ Licenses Act has given, and is still giving, a great deal
of trouble. The Hoondamal case is still fresh in the memory. A
merchant of long standing, having first-class European custom,
trading in a store decently kept, has been persecuted for daring to
remove his store from one place to another, only a few doors away,
for the reason that the change has been made to West Street, which
the Town Council wishes to reserve not for Euro- pean trade but for
European store-keepers only. The issue between the Town Council and
the Indian community has not yet been deci- ded. The matter is under
review by the Supreme Court. But it is abun- dantly clear that the
Natal Licensing Act, if it is to give any peace to the Indian
community, must be changed so as to restore to the Supr- eme Court
its inherent powers to review all judicial decisions given by any
officer whether he is called a Magistrate or a Licensing Officer. The
condition of the indentured Indians now and then calls for remar- ks.
The cases that have recently been tried in Ladysmith and to which
prominent attention has been drawn by our contemporary, <i>The </i><i>Natal
</i><i>Witness</i>, require investigation. The question of the
education of the Indian children in Natal is a most important one
and, as the ex-Sup- erintendent of Education, Mr. Barnett, has well
said, they cannot safely be neglected if only for the sake of the
white Colonists. Either the ordinary schools should be left open or
new schools be established to give a suitable education to the Indian
children. And here it may be remarked that it would be a desirable
addition to the usual curriculum to require a knowledge of Indian
languages. Interpretation that avails in the Colony is by no means
satisfactory without the fault of the interpreters and it would be a
cheap way of getting suitable interpre- ters to educate the Indian
youths in Indian languages.</p>

As to the Transvaal, it still continues to be the source of the
greatest anxiety to the Indian community. Nothing there is yet
settled. Law 3 of 1885 is being enforced rigorously. Indeed, the
present Gov- ernment have even gone beyond the Law. They have pressed
into service the Peace Preservation Ordinance, which is purely a
political measure, in order to keep the Indian out of the Transvaal.
Even <i>bona</i>- <i>fide </i>refugees are prevented from entering
the country. The case of <i>Habib Motan </i>v. <i>The
</i><i>Attonery-General </i>has given the Indian traders a sort of
relief and has saved them from threatened extinction. But the victory
in that case has given rise to a violent, aggressive and unin- formed
agitation against the British Indians in the Transvaal. It culmi-
nated in the now notorious anti-Asiatic convention which recom-
mended drastic and un-English measures and supported them by
inflammatory speeches. Mr. Loveday distinguished  himself  by making
a speech which drew from the Chairman of the British Indian
Asso-ciation a sharp reply. Mr. Loveday tried to controvert the
statements made by Mr. Adbul Gani. But he has been again baffled by
that gentleman. He has sent to <i>The </i><i>Star </i>a complete and
categorical retort.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>Thus, although the British Indian Association is often
able to meet unscrupulous statements by true facts, the position 
remains  acute. The people of Potchefstroom and other places have
been advocating a boycott and wounding even the religious
susceptibilities of the local Indians. In the meanwhile, previous
time is being wasted by an ever shifting policy. Lord Milner has
failed to be firm on the side of justice and has yielded away the
rights of the British Indians to a clamorous and interested
agitation. Happily, the Indian Government have shown firmness and it
may be hoped that a reasonable solution of the diffi-culty will be
arrived at before long.</p>

The Orange River Colony has remained thorough. That it has also
remained un-British does not concern its inhabitants. The war was
waged for the Indians, among others. The Union Jack waves over Blo-
emfontein but it affords no shelter to the British Indian who is
shun- ned like a Pariah.</p>

At the Cape, one notices the curious phenomenon of separate
legislation for separate parts of the Colony. Thus, an Indian in Cape
Town enjoys the ordinary civic liberty. At East London, he may not
walk in foot-paths, and the dependency of Transkei, he may not even
enter. We firmly believe that this reactionary policy is a direct
result of Lord Milnerâs Bazaar Notice in the Transvaal. Thereby, he
let the world know that the British Indian was not to receive common
protec- tion of his rights. No wonder that the self-governing Colony

We cannot allow certain statements, made at the Potchefstroom
meeting, recently reported<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 
 </font></sup>in our columns, to pass unchallenged, as we consider it
necessary to place before our European friends the true facts, so as
to enable them rightly to understand the Indian position.</p>

We would quote Mr. Lovedayâs own words with regard to the admission
of Indians into the Transvaal.</p>

Mr. Loveday would, therefore, make it appear that there were no
Indian trading in the Transvaal before 1884, and that, therefore,
Indians were not contemplated when the Convention was drawn up.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
It is, nevertheless, a fact that Indians were contemplated in the
working of the Convention, and that Indian merchants were trading in
the Transvaal in 1881 and 1882 and, consequently, before 1884. Mr.
Lovedayâs âfactsâ are thus vitiated, in this respect at least.
Moreover, as Mr. Gani has pointed out in a letter to <i>The Star</i>,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

misrepresentations on the part of a large section of the white

Mr. Loveday, then, as we have said, has been guilty of sins of
omission and of commission, and it will became him to attempt to draw
the red herring of personal abuse across the trail.</p>

As for the matter of Arab traders spending no more than Â£40 per
year, it is incorrect to say that an Indian merchant spends no more
than Â£ 40 a year. If, as Mr. Loveday says, he has five assistants,
as is not infrequently the case, each at Â£24 per annum, that must be
an initial expense of Â£120 per annum, exclusive of his own trade
expenses, personal expenses, rent and rates. In any case, we do not,
from experience, expect Mr. Loveday to accept Mr. Ganiâs challenge.</p>

In another article,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>we
have already dealt with the number  of Indians now in the Transvaal,
and the question of their alleged continuous arrival in the Colony.
We need only remark that we have the authority of the Chief Secretary
for Permits that Mr. Lovedayâs âfactsâ are wrong. In referring
to the number of stores <i>in Pretoria</i>, Mr. Loveday was careless
enough to remark that they had increased enormously. It is a fact
that, since the war, they have decreased by some <i>thirty per cent</i>,
the number of white stores having increased in at least a similar
proportion<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font><i>in Pretoria</i>.
The Location is quite another matter, and the subject should not have
been dragged in by the hair of the head, for the purpose of creating
fictitious impressions. If, then, Mr. Loveday is wrong as to matters
relating to his own town, how can he be expected to know the facts
concerning other towns of the Trans- vaal, concerning other Colonies
of South Africa, concerning India itself? We propose to deal in a
further article with the charge of un- truthfulness levelled against
the Indian, and endeavour to show that men, perfectly qualified to
give an opinion on such a matter, <font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>which,
we submit, with all due deference, Mr. Loveday is not<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>hold
very dif- ferent views.</p>

Mr. Loveday stated that the Crown Prosecutor in India had certain
powers of re-trying prisoners, quashing sentences, and taking cases
to higher courts, because perjury, in India was looked upon as the
proper thing. Apart altogether from the question of perjury, it will
no doubt surprise Mr. Loveday to learn that the Crown Prosecutor in
India has no greater powers than the Attorney-General of the
Transvaal and, in fact, his powers are not nearly so wide.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">But

omit to mention the cardinal fact that many of these Crown Prosecu-

significant omission.</p>

Referring now to the franchise of the Indian, it is a fact that he
does possess a very definite francise. Almost every town of impor-
tance in India has its Town Council or Local Board, partially  or 
wholly elected by the rate-payers the majority of whom are Indians.
There is, therefore, the municipal franchise to begin with. There is
also an indirect political franchise, in that some of the members of
the Legislative Councils of the different Presidencies are elected by
the members of the Corporations, who themselves are directly elected
by the tax-payers. Hence we are quite within our rights in using the
expression âIndian franchiseâ. Therefore, also, Mr. Loveday was,
as usual, inaccurate in stating that, in India, âthere were no
forms of representative institutions, and that all present knew the
Indian was governed by military rule, aided by religion and casteâ.
As to there being no social intercourse between Indian and white, Mr.
Loveday forgets the great viceregal and Governmental receptions,
where both sections of the community commingle, and such functions as
the balls given by the Maharaja of Kuch Bahar,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>where
white and Indian meet on equal terms. But this is all beyond the
mark, for the Indian community in South Africa does not desire and
has never demanded social intercourse with the whites believing it to
be unnecessary and and inadvisable, for many reasons.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.19cm; line-height: 102%">
Certainly Indians are entertained at officersâ messes, as witness
the case of Colonel Sir Pertab Singh, the King-Emperorâs personal
friend and aide-de-camp. Certainly, also, white soldiers salute the
higher ranks of Indian officers.</p>

The question of a bastard race, resulting from intercourse between
whites and Indians, was also brought forward, for obvious reasons, at
the meeting. It does not require to be said that anybody with the
faintest knowledge of Indian life and Indian customs would never have
dreamt of bringing forward such an argument as this, and we will not
labour the subject.</p>

The people at Home had so far forgotten themselves that they had
actually elected a black man to the British House of Parliament;
they, in this country, would never do it, they would not so far
forget their colour,said Mr. Loveday. But what can we say to so
ungentlemanly a remark? We think that the electors who sent Mr.
Dadabhai Naoroji to Parliament, despite the gibe of the late Lord
Salisbury, fairly represen-ted the accumulated statesmanship of some
forty millions of British people. We have but one more inaccuracy to
refute. Mr. Sampson stated that Indians made chairs and tables in
their own houses in Joh-annesburg, and sold them on the open market,
in competition with the goods of white manufactures. This is,
bluntly, untrue. There are no In-dian artisans in Johannesburg
working on such a scale as this. Surely, the absurdity of such a
statement is self- evident enough.</p>

The above statement reminds us of the story of a merchant who, one
day, said to his traveller: âGet business, honestly, if you can,
but get businessâ. A similar idea seems to have prevailed amongst
the speakers at the Potchefstroom meeting. It was as though they had
said to each other: âCreate a strong anti-Indian feeling, honestly,
if you can, but create it !â</p>

We have carefully examined the columns of our esteemed con-
temporary, the Johannesburg <i>Star</i>, and, so far, have failed to
observe that Mr. T. Kleinenberg has written his acceptance of the
challenge thrown out by the Chairman of the British Indian
Association. We shall be glad to learn if Mr. Ganiâs opponent
intends to avail himself of the opportunity given to him to refute
the statements made at the Indian mass meeting. It seems to us to be
most unfair, not only to Mr. Gani and to the public at large, but to
Mr. Kleinenberg himself, for the latter to leave the matter where it
now stands, and we are sure, knowing what an honourable man Mr.
Kleinenberg is, that he has no intention of passing over the
challenge issued by the Mr. Gani. We have no doubt whatever but that,
if Mr. Kleinenberg finds that he has made a serious error in
endeavouring to rebut the facts given by Mr. Gani, he will have the
moral courage to acknowledge the correctness of the figures that Mr.
Gani gave, and to withdraw his own statement.</p>

Mr. Gani himself has publicly stated his willingness to make the
<i>amende honorable</i>, should he be found to be in fault. That
being the case, we see no reason whatever why a matter, so easily
settled by facts offered or rebutted by either side, should not

Even the business people in Potchefstroom, who have only a remote and
temporary connexion with the place, are either infected with its
unreasonable anti-Indian prejudice, or are being intimidated into the
commission of acts of which, in their freer moments, they would be
heartily ashamed. An esteemed correspondent informs us that the
insurance agents have, suddenly and without notice, withdrawn their
fire policies from the Indian merchants. We have never heard of such
an instance anywhere else. We are informed that the petty agents, who
have succumbed, as we have said, either to local prejudice or to
intimidation, represent world-famous insurance companies, and we
should be very much surprised if the stupid and unbusinesslike action
of their agents be sanctioned by the head officers of these
companies. We only hope that both the agents and the managers
headquarters will see these lines, and we strongly advise the Indian
merchants concerned to make representation at headquarters. The
policy that Potchefstroom is developing in this matter is un-British
in the extreme, and it remains to be seen how far it will be endorsed
in other parts of the Transvaal.</p>

was a large Indian population, a good library was indeed neces- sary;
and to meet that need leading citizens and businessmen of Dur- ban
had, some years earlier, made great efforts, and a library known as
the Diamond Jubilee Library<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>was
started in commemoration of the event. But later, for lack of
sufficient care and supervision, it was closed down. He hoped that
the new Library would not be reduced to a similar condition but that
it would improve from day to day. that the organisers would keep up
their present enthusiasm and continue their efforts to ensure its
permanent existence.</p>

Mr. Gandhi then made some valuable suggestions regarding the
selection of books and the hours during which the library should be
kept open. He exhorted the public to visit the library, particularly
on Sundays, sit amidst the books, those mute, noble friends, and
study them to profit.</p>

He closed his address with a few words about <i>Indian Opinion</i>,
and the library was then declared open.</p>

The existence of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>you know. It has now
embar- ked on career when I think I may fairly appeal to you for
active sym- pathy. I propose to write perfectly frankly, as you know
me too well to misunderstand me. When I saw that Mr. Madanjit could
not carry on the paper without pecuniary assistance and as I knew
that he was guided by thoroughly patriotic motives, I placed at his
service the bulk of my savings. That, however, was not enough. Three
months ago I took over the whole responsibility and management. Mr.
Mad- anjit still remains nominally the proprietor and publisher,
because I believe that he has done much for the community. My own
office is at present being worked in the interests of <i>Indian
Opinion </i>and I have already become responsible to the extent of
nearly Â£ 3,500. Some English friends, who knew me intimately and
before whom I placed the scheme as described in the enclosed, took up
the idea and now it is in full working order and, although it does
not show the same measure of self-sacrifice as shown by the founders
of the Fergusson College in Poona, I venture to think that it is not
a bad copy. It has been a most delightful thing to me to see the
English friends coming forward so boldly. They are not literary men
but they are sterling, honest, inde- pendent men. Each of them had
his own business or employment where he was doing well, and yet none
of them had the slightest hesi- tation in coming forward as a worker
for a bare living which means</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; line-height: 0.42cm">Â£
3 per month, with a distant prospect of getting profits.</p>

It is also my intention, if my earnings continue, to open a school on
the grounds, which would be second to none in South Africa for the
education primarily of Indian children who would be resident boarders
and, secondarily, of all who want to join the school</p>

but would also reside on the premises. For this, too, volunteer
workers are required. It would be possible to induce one or two
Englishmen and English ladies here to give their lifetime to this
work, but Indian teachers are absolutely necessary. Could you induce
any graduates who have an aptitude for teaching, who bear a blameless
character and who would be prepared to work for a mere living? Those
who would come must be well-tried, first-class men. I would want two
or three at least but more could certainly be accommodated, and after
the school is in working order, it is intended to add a sanatorium
with open-air treatment on hygienic lines. My immediate purpose,
however, is in connection with <i>Indian Opinion</i>. If you approve
of all I have said regarding it, will you kindly send a letter of
encouragement to be sent to the editor for publication; also if you
could spare a few moments, occasionally write an article ever so
small for it? I am also anxious to secure either honorary or paid
correspondents who would contribute weekly notes in English,
Gujarati, Hindi and Tamil. If it becomes expensive, I might have to
be satisfied with only English correspon- dence which would lend
itself to being translated in the three Indian languages. Could you
recommend any such correspondent or corres- pondents? The weekly
notes should give an idea of what is being done on your side with
reference to the Indian question, giving extracts from notices of the
question in the newspapers, and should contain matters that are
likely to be interesting to the Indians in South Africa. You may at
your discretion disclose partly or wholly the contents of this letter
in so far as such a course may be necessary in the interests of the
subject-matter hereof. I hope you are keeping good health.</p>

There seems to be a very general impression current that truth-
fulness, the outward manifestation of the eternal search after Truth,
is  a virtue entirely foreign to the nature of the inhabitants of
India. Room is not left for the possibility of misunderstanding,
allowance is not made for the probability of wrong comprehension, but
the Indian is set down at once as a scamp, a rogue, a lying
vagabond<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>all said, as a human
being destitute of every vestige of honour.</p>

Little or no differentiation is made between the Indians who have
come to this country. All are classed indiscriminately as âcooliesâor
âArabsâ, and all are stigmatised as actual or potential liars. It
is for-gotten, that generally speaking, there are two  main classes
of Indians in South Africa, the first being the indentured labourer
class, and the second being the trading class. As often as not, the
indentured Indian is of low caste, and, consequently,  once removed
from his accustomed surroundings, and the moral restraints of his
place of residence in India, he is liable to fall, in exactly the
same way as any other human being situated in similar circumstances,
from the ethical standard that he had set up for him when in India.

Professor Max Muller points out, with Colonel Sleeman, that whoever
is ignorant of the life of the Indian village communities, as is

their village lifeâ.</p>

We think that we have quoted sufficiently from men able, from
experience, to give a just opinion, to prove the utter falsity of the
general charge of want of veracity levelled at the Indians. Where
there is any lapse from strict adherence to accuracy of fact, it is
but too often due to the Indians having been removed from all sources
of moral control. Indeed, Sir George Campbell is quoted as saying
that âthe longer we possess a province, the more common and grave
does perjury becomeâ.</p>

We will conclude with one brief reference to the recent mass meeting
at Potchefstroom. Mr. Loveday had much to say concerning Oriental
duplicity, falsehood, and cunning, and he even quoted Lord Macaulay
as saying, with regard to Clive, that it was âunquestionable that
the duplicity of India had left its stain upon his (Cliveâs)
charac- terâ.</p>

Now, we beg to point out that Macaulay, of all historians, is no
longer read for his accuracy or his strict adherence to the simple
facts of the case, but rather for his literary style and merit.

reprodu- cing the following words of his, which apply now, to-day,

The Indians resident in London, together with their European friends,
gave a dinner in honour of Sir William Wedderburn and Sir Henry S.
Cotton at the Westminster Palace Hotel on November 29, 1904, before
their departure from that city. Prominent people were invited to the
function, and speeches were made. In his speech Sir Henry Cotton made
a brief comparison between the Indian National Congress and the
Russian Zemstvos. From a perusal of a later report, this analogy
gives rise to a number of thoughts.</p>

Every Indian knows in general and ought to know, if he already does
not, what the Indian National Congress is, its origin, its function
and its influence on the people as well as on the Government. It is
now twenty years since the Congress was founded. The first session
was held in Bombay; and such was the enthusiasm, insight,
perseverance and courage of our Indian leaders of the time that
far-sighted persons felt convinced that the association would
certainly be able to breathe new life into this country. It is
particularly necessary to remember this origin of the Congress. Lord
Dufferin believed that such a body  should be founded. He talked
about it to Mr. Hume; the idea was very much to the latterâs liking
and, as a result of his consultations with prominent public men in
India, the Congress was ultimately founded. It is necessary to bear
this fact in mind, as it would be useful to us in refuting the
numerous charges levelled against the Congress by its enemies. The
founding of the Congress caused great alarm particu- larly in the
minds of the autocratic, short-sighted and haughty offi- cials. For
they foresaw that the Congress would grow in strength day by day;
that, looking upon the Congress as their very mother, the people
would express their thoughts and feelings fearlessly at its</p>

sessions; and that, consequently, autocracy and arrogance would no
longer have their way unchallenged. They were afraid and began to
raise an outcry through their Press and made all sorts of unbecoming
charges against the loyal Congress, hoping that as a result its life
would be cut short. These officers and their journals began heartily
to abuse Congress leaders and tried to show that it was a seditious
body and that, if the Government did not suppress it, the
organisation would prove dangerous to the state. The battle of
arguments carried on during Lord Riponâs<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup>regime, however, opened their eyes and proved that not
only could Indians understand their own interests, but that they
could also formulate honest plans for the advancement of their
country. On the establishment of the Congress these thoughts recurred
to the officials with the same intensity, and pressure was brought to
bear on the Government. Moreover, with a view to creating internal
dissensions in the Congress, the Hindu-Muslim question was raised and
attempts were energetically made to foster disunity within the ranks
of the Hindus and of the Muslims by creating distinctions as between
Bengalis, Punjabis and Madrasis, etc. In a short time, these
obstructionists raised such a clamour that it influenced even a sound
statesman like Lord Dufferin, who, speaking at the St. Andrewâs
Din- ner before leaving Calcutta, won Anglo-Indian applause by
venting his spleen upon the Congress. It is no doubt true that, when
the late Mr. Bradlaugh<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  
</font></sup>expressed his opinion on this subject, Lord Dufferin had
thought it fit to write to him [in order to clarify his speech]. But
that is another story. What we have at present to consider is just
this: that, in spite of such difficulties, our leaders did not lose
heart, but went on calmly doing their duty. And thanks to their
efforts, the time has now come when even the enemies of the Congress
have to admit its stren-gth, and haughty officials have to pay heed
to its suggestions.</p>

The Punjab Government Report on liquor states that many people in the
Punjab have taken to drink out of a dread of plague, and there has
consequently been a great increase in the excise revenue from liquor.
The Report, moreover, states that the epidemic has bro- ken out more
virulently and casualties have been more numerous in places where
people took to drinking in the belief that liquor preven- ted plague
infection, but that rather less harm was done by plague where people
did not drink at all. Although this does not prove that abstainers
are immune from plague, this much it does prove that drin- king leads
to utter ruin. Dr. Mellis, who was the Chief Medical Officer in the
Plague Hospital in Johannesburg, is also of the same opinion, namely,
that drinking does not check, but aggravates the plague.</p>

	Plague seems to have broken out in Johannesburg. A few days ago, the
	son of a Muslim hawker in Sower Street caught the infection. His
	doctor informed the authorities on Saturday. On Sunday, he was
	removed to the Plague Hospital, the young man died to-day and has
	already been buried. No funeral rites could, therefore, be
	performed. Normally, the authorities would gladly have handed the
	body over for this purpose.</p>

	I venture to bring to your notice the journal, Indian Opinion, which
	has been now in existence for the last eighteen months. During that
	period I have been intimately connected with it. In my humble
	opinion, it is discharging a worthy mission in that it acts as an
	inter- preter between the two great communities in South Africa. Its
	aim is Imperial and though it does and it must lay stress upon the
	grievances of the British Indians in South Africa, it often tones
	down the feelings of the Indian community, and it never fails to
	point out to it its short- comings in the clearest possible terms,
	but now in its new garb and in its new abode, it represents much
	more. It represents a scheme which is briefly described in the
	enclosed,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup>and
	if it is at all successful, it may mark a revolution in business
	methods. Anyhow the fact that there are four independent Englishmen
	who were engaged in their own busi- nesses, [who] have given them up
	in order to work for its realisation and that there is an equal
	number of Indians who have done likewise<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
	</font></sup>cannot but commend itself to you. In spite, however, of
	this band of eight founders the scheme must depend upon public
	support for suc- cess. There are two ways in which, I venture to
	think, you could assist the enterprises. The first by becoming a
	subscriber and by occasion- ally writing for it either over your own
	signature or anonymously.</p>

	In another column of this issue will be found the published
	correspondence between the Potchefstroom Chief of Police and the
	Secretary of the Potchefstroom British Indian Committee, relative to
	a subscription from the latter body in support of a scheme for the
	esta- blishment of a properly equipped fire-brigade. This
	correspondence passed some few weeks since, and it throws an
	interesting light upon a side of the Indian character that has been
	hitherto carefully ignored by the white residents of Potchefstroom.
	It is to be hoped that other journals will give wider circulation to
	the facts chronicled in these two letters, for it is eminently
	desirable that the attitude of the British Indian community in
	Potchefstroom should be properly understood by our opponents.</p>

	We learn that the Municipality found themselves unable to contribute
	the necessary funds in aid of the fire-brigade scheme, and, so far
	as we are aware, that scheme fell through.</p>

	But the point that we desire to make is this, that, at the time the
	proposal was made by Capt. Jones and accepted by Mr. Rahman, several
	of the Indian merchants, and those, too, who would have sub- scribed
	most largely to the fund, were already insured against fire.</p>

	We wish this to be very carefully understood in view of the sequel,
	for it throws the disinterestedness of the motives of the British
	Indian community of Potchefstroom in high relief against the some-
	what gloomy background of Vigilance vindictiveness.</p>

In our issue of January 7th, we drew urgent attention to the action
of a fire-insurance agent in Potchefstroom in causing the can-
cellation, without notice, of certain policies that had been granted
to British Indian merchants, covering their premises against the
risks of fire, and that did not expire for several months to come. It
transpires that this gentleman represents one of the oldest
established fire-insu- rance companies in the world. At least six
important merchants are affected, and their premises are no longer
insured. We are told, upon the best authority, that this gentleman
has, if not actually joined the Anti-Asiatic Vigilance Association,
at least been adversely influenced by that body of terrorists. The
âfiery crossâ has gone forth, and the world now knows that the
white people of Potchefstroom have insti- tuted a system of boycott
that has, as one of its direct effects, the placing of the premises
of inoffensive citizens in jeopardy, and that creates a serious risk
to the Indian merchants of seeing the whole fruits of many years of
hard, irksome toil consumed before their very eyes. Malignancy could
go no further. With no fire-brigade at hand, these unfortunate people
are now helpless, and at the mercy of any stray spark that the winds
may carry along, or of any incendiary whose morbid Colour-madness may
induce him to bring fiery ruin upon the head of the wretched owner of
the first inviting store that may present itself.</p>

We do not speak wild words of hysteria, for the danger is a very real
one. The dastardly attempt at incendiarism in Potchefstroom, shortly
after the virulent anti-Indian epidemic reached a crisis there, will
still be fresh in the memories of our readers. We use the world
âincen-diarismâ, in this connexion, on the authority of the Chief
of Police himself, and we regret to think that this courteous officer
is not in a position to guard every store that is liable to attack 
in  this  cowardly way.</p>

From the point of view of the fire-insurance company itself, the
Indian stores in Potchefstroom should at least be a favourable a risk
as those of the European traders, for, from our own intimate
knowledge of them, the comparison between the stores of the two
sections of the community would not be unfavourable to the Indians.
Consequently, we are unable to find any grounds for the inexplicable
action of the company in cancelling the policies. There could surely
be no question of commercial integrity involved, or the traders
affected would never</p>

have been granted polices. Moreover, they are all well-known merch-
ants of established character, and even the most superficial
inquiries would have revealed the fact that there could be no
foundation for any imputation against their honour and
trustworthiness.</p>

The whole affair does not greatly redound to the credit of Pot-
chefstroom, and the scandal thus perpetrated places a stigma upon the
fire-insurance company concerned.</p>

It is our intention to call the immediate attention of the head-
quarters staff of the company to the matter. We are certain that its
British sense of justice and of fair play will induce it to make the
most stringent inquiries, and we have no doubt whatever but that an
intolerable situation will be terminated as speedily as is possible
in the circumstances.</p>

Every wise ruler is eager to know the real condition of his subjects,
their happiness and their misery, and so are, more or less, our
King-Emperor Edward and the Czar of Russia. Both of them have the
same desire, but employ different methods. Fortunately for us, the
officers in India are not so arrogant as those in Russia; nor have
they the same [wide] powers. That is to say, Indian officials have to
conf- orm to rules and cannot show the same arrogance and high-hande-
dness as their opposite numbers in Russia. So that, on the whole,
officials in India cannot, even if they would, tyrannize over the
people to the same extent as in Russia. Even so, some of the
sufferings of the Russian and Indian peoples are of the same kind,
even if those in India are comparatively less acute. But the people
India in do not look upon their hardships as normal-and this is but
natural. In Russia there is no difference of colour, creed, caste or
language between the offici- als and the subjects, while in India the
officials are in every way diff- erent from the people, and some
aloofness-though this is hardly nec- essary-is, therefore, always
felt. These grievances naturally cause the people some unhappiness.
There, then, exists, in both the countries, a certain coolness and
distance between the officials and the people and</p>

the latter smart under it. They believe that the relations between
the ruler and the ruled should be very close; that there should be
mutual trust, that they should share in the otherâs weal and woe
and treat one another with love and affection. In short, there should
an identity of interest between the king and his subjects, the former
being consid- ered happy only if the latter are so. The king no doubt
wields power, but if he abuses it, both he and his subjects will
suffer. Hence it is that wise rulers are always eager to know the
true condition of their subjects, their joy and their sorrow.</p>

The kingdoms of old were generally very small compared to those of
to-day, and the king could easily rule over his subjects him- self.
But, as the kingdoms grew in size, the need of employing offi- cials
arose, with the result that in all civilised communities kings have
been reduced to the status of figure-heads, and officials have become
indispensable and all-important. The officials know quite well that,
without them, there can be no king, and they naturally contrive in
all possible ways to ensure that their prestige and authority are
never det- racted from. Consequently, they begin to consider
self-interest more important than duty, and sufficient attention is
not paid to the welfare of the people. This leads to discontent and
as the officials do not have the patience to listen to the complaints
or criticism of the people, a cleavage between the two develops. This
leads to all possible efforts and plans by the subjects to break
official high-handedness and to protect their own rights. Instances
are few where the standard of adm- inistration is good; more often it
is inefficient or corrupt. There is a great deal of difference
between the policies of the Governments of Russia and India, and,
consequently, between the peopleâs condition and feelings in the
two countries. But the officials in both countries have more or less
excessive powers and, therefore, the relations bet- ween them and the
people are not what they should be. It must be clear from the
foregoing that the feelings and demands of the people are, in several
respects, the same in both countries, though the con- ditions differ.
This is due to the far too scanty contact between the ruler and the
ruled. As the causes are similar, so are the results.</p>

Wonderful are the ways of Nature. Last November, there was a public
discussion regarding the agenda for the Congress session at Bombay.
About the same time, the local assemblies in Russia, called Zemstvos,
declared their aspirations and demands. Whereas the reso- lutions to
be moved in the Congress session were first discussed in provincial
committees and subsequently published by the Congress</p>

The maternal uncle of the boy who died of plague had come here to see
him. He fled to Pretoria in fear, with the result that he got into
more trouble. He and his family were inoculated and kept under

here under the supervision of the authorities, he would have been
spared all this trouble.</p>

The condition of the Malay Location here has greatly deter- iorated
in some respects. People have huddled together and some of them pay
no heed whatever to any talk of sanitation. A committee has been
appointed, which goes out every night to inspect the houses; and it
has now been decided that, if the people do not listen to its instru-
ctions, the authorities should be informed. Indeed, it is better that
this should be so. If we keep our weaknesses hidden over a period of
time and plague subsequently breaks out there, the Malay Location,
too, will be wiped out like the Indian, and we shall have to wring
our hands in helplessness. It is, therefore, necessary to publish the
names of those who are willing to get out of the filth for that will
only be adminis- tering a bitter dose in their interests as well
those of others.</p>

We publish in another column a very important statement from our
correspondent at Potchefstroom. Two glaring mis-statements were made
at the Convention. The one was with reference to Pietersburg, and the
other, to Potchefstroom. With respect to both these towns, the
speakers boldly alleged that the Indians were swamping European
trade, and that their present strength was considerably in excess of
what it was before the war. As to Pietersburg, the fallacy has been
exp- loded. Mr. Kleinenberg has not yet shown that the statements,
made by Mr. Abdool Gani.  <i>Th</i><i>e</i><i> </i><i>Sta</i><i>r</i>,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>are
incorrect. Now we have a report from Potchefstroom, and, seeing that
our correspondent gives the names of the British Indian store-keepers
at present trading within the town limits, we think that this report
should be considered satisfactory by the public as it undoubtedly is
to us. Even were it true that there is now a greater number of Indian
store-keepers in Potchefstroom, or in any other place, that could
never be a reason for confiscation  of rights, but since sensational
statements have been made without any truth in them, it is as well
that the public should be placed in poss- ession of facts as they
are, and that the Indian said of the question should not be
prejudiced by exaggeration on the part of the anti- Indian party. The
most painful part, however, of this whole affair is that those who
pose as leaders have shown themselves utterly incom- petent even to
examine the truth of matters that have been placed before them. They
have, in their eagerness to make out an anti-Indian argument,
accepted any fiction that has been passed on to them.</p>

by the Health Officer for the Borough of Durban. We cannot but think
that this is an opportunity for the Indians to show their capabil-
ity, and it is for the leaders to come forward and appeal to the rank
and file with reference to strict observance of sanitary regulations.
The plague is undoubtedly the off-spring of poverty and filth. We
know that the poorer class of Indians are not in a position to do all
that may be necessary. They may not, for instance, be able to have
well-ven- tilated rooms or houses situated in healthy localities, but
when allow- ance has been made for all these things, there is
undoubtedly a great deal that can be done by proper co-operation and
gentle coaxing, and we hope that the community will rise to the
occasion and take the necessary precautions. We would, at the same
time, draw the attention of our esteemed Health Officer to the
condition of the Western Vlei<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>and the Eastern Vlei. These two spots require immediate
attention, and with them the Indians are unable to deal. It is for
the Town Council to take heroic measures, and either permanently mend
the two places or end them. They are, anyway, a reflection on the
premier borough in South Africa. The disquieting news from
Johannesburg, too, should place us on our guard, and we have no doubt
that the British Indians there will do their duty, and assist the
authorities in every possible manner to prevent a repetition of the
outbreak that took place last year. We are informed that the
attention of the authorities has been more than once drawn to the
state of the Malay Location, and, although it is kept by the
inhabitants in a very good condition, whilst the houses are well
built, the fact that practically the whole of the Indian population
of the burnt-down Location is now concentrated in the Malay Location
should not be lost sight of, and the Town Council of Johannesburg
will not be able to free itself from blame if the plague
unfortunately breaks out in the Location. It has, certainly,
hirtherto failed in its duty to provide permanent shelter for those
who were dis-possessed on the burning of the Indian Location, and, as
the custodian of the public health, it will have failed in its duty
still further if it neglects to remove the pressure on the Malay
Location.</p>

The Johannesburg Town Council has been for some time considering the
question of Native cyclists. The Works Committee brought out, last
week, a report, and advised that a bye-law should be passed whereby
âevery Native, holding a cycle permit and riding a cycle within the
municipal area, should wear on his left arm, in a cons- picuous
position, a numbered badge which shall be issued to him, tog- ether
with his permitâ. That, in a cosmopolitan town like Johannes- burg,
the Town Council should, by a large majority, have passed such  a
drastic bye-law is to us a matter of painful surprise,
notwithstanding the fact that colour prejudice is a strong ruling
sentiment in South Africa. Mr. Langermann was the champion supporter
of the bye-law against the mild protest from Messrs. Mackie Niven and
Quinn, and he justified it on the ground that they must make a
distinction between Native and white riders of bicycles. âThe
badge,â he said, âmust be in front. It was absolutely necessary
to distinguish the Native from the white men.â This remark
naturally excited some laughter, as, unlike Mr. Langermann, the other
members were evidently quite capable of distinguishing a Native from
a white man without a badge being necessary. Mr. Langermann, in our
opinion, proves the truth of the adage that those, who have suffered
persecution, instead of sympath- ising with the persecuted after they
have escaped from it themselves, delight in the persecution of
others. Mr. Langermann is never slow in protesting against the
persecution of his co-religionists in Russia. May not a Native ask
the question<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>has he no feelings?
However, we are more concerned with the general attitude of the Town
Council, as rep- resented by the majority of its members, than with
Mr. Langermannâs views. The tone of the speeches made at the
meeting was, we say with all deference to the Town Council, highly
discreditable, and reflects all the greater honour on the minority
consisting of Messrs.  Niven, Quinn, Rockey, and Pim, who had the
courage of their convictions, and did not hesitate to defend the
Native against unnecessary and wanton indignity. We are, as a rule,
very reluctant about expressing opinions on matters not specially
coming within the purview of this journal, but the proceedings of the
Town Council are, in our opinion, so scandalous, that we should be
failing in our duty if we did not, in</p>

The Hoondamal case has now entered upon the last stage, or, shall we
say, the first stage of a new phase. Hoondamal, the individual,
disappears from view, but the Indian trading community replaces him.
In the Test Case of <i>Hoondamal </i>v. <i>Rex</i>, the Supreme Court
has said the final word, and the Durban Town Council has won a
momentary triumph.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
We use the word âmomentaryâ deliberately. We cannot think that a
triumph of prejudice and injustice can ever be permanent. Such a
conclusion would be entirely opposed to all the teachings of history
and philosophy.</p>

Is there anyone who will dare say that the Town Council of Durban has
shown even the slightest desire or inclination to mete out justice to
this unfortunate man? Every means has been taken by it to bring about
his ruin, because, in the words of the Licensing Officer- which have
been officially disapproved of, but which, we have only too much
reason to believe, are privately endorsed by members of the Town
Council âfurther Asiatic licences should not be granted in West
Streetâ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.26cm; line-height: 95%">
There are times when what is nearest the heart is nearest the lips,
and we fear that, notwithstanding the official disclaimer of the Town
Council, the Licensing Officerâs opinion is emphatically held by
his employers, and the cat has, perhaps unwittingly, been let out of
the bag. The effect, then, of the Supreme Courtâs decision is to
make West Street a close preserve for white traders, and âno
Indians need applyâ for licences to trade in that select
thoroughfare.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
But, we ask, can the matter be allowed to remain where it is? Dare
such a condition of affairs be permitted to be continued? We think
not. We do not now deal with the legal merits of the case, but it
appears more than strange that the Supreme Court should have ruled
that a man, holding a trading licence, can have his, licence
nullified by mere removal from one place to another within the
boundaries of the same town. However that may be, the matter seems to
us to be sufficiently important to be taken to a higher tribunal. It
may well be that other arguments can be produced that will entail
some modi- fication of the present conditions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
Whilst the drama before the Supreme Court was in process of
enactment, a side issue was being considered within the Town Council
Chamber. The Durban Corporation has attacked the Hoondamal citadel in
West Street from all directions, and it would appear that the sapping
tactics have proved successful in undermining its foundations. By
these devious methods, the fortress has, seemingly, fallen, but the
defender has not been disgraced, for from the ashes of his defence
will arise a yet mightier champion, who will wrench justice from
relu- ctant hands, an compel circumstances to his needs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.29cm; line-height: 102%">
The side issue, to which we have made reference, was the appeal of
Mr. Hoondamal to the Town Council against the Licensing Offi- cerâs
decision to refuse a licence in respect of the premises in West
Street. In spite of the dignified protest of Mr. Burne, the Town
Coun- cil has upheld the Licensing Officerâs decision to refuse the
licence, and although dissociating itself publicly from the reason
given by the Licensing Officer, it has not substituted a reason of
its own for the one repudiated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.28cm; line-height: 102%">
But another astounding point arises in connection with this hearing.
The Mayor has laid down the extraordinary dictum that the Licensing
Officerâs discretion is arbitrary, and not, as contended by Mr.
Hoondamalâs counsel, to be exercised within the four corners of the
law. It is not within our province to comment upon the legal aspect
of this ruling; we merely place it on record. The struggle promises
to be a titanic one. Indeed, the Indian community must either take it
up or succumb. It is no mere question of the annihilation of Mr.
Hoon- damal. Whilst such a result would be deplorable, it would be
compara- tively insignificant. The matter is of far larger concern
than the con- servation of the privileges of an individual. The whole
Indian trading community is threatened with extinction. What has
happened to Mr. Hoondamal may happen to every single Indian trader.
So long as the newly-laid-down interpretation of the law holds good,
no Indianâs business is worth a dayâs takings.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 102%">
The net result of the decision of the Supreme Court is this. It is
known that the desire of the white population is to stamp out the
Indian traders piecemeal. It has been ruled that licences are granted
for particular premises only and are not transferable. A landlord
may, in consequence, rackrent a tenant trader to the top of his bent,
and the trader is abjectly helpless. He must either be ruined by the
landlord or</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
he must seek new premises. If he chooses the latter alternative, his
licence becomes invalid, and his trading privileges null and void. He
cannot obtain what will then be considered a new licence, for just as
it may be (unofficially) judged to be unnecessary to issue new
licences for Asiatics to trade in West Street, so every other trading

This is a matter, not for individual consideration, but for the
corporate deliberation of the whole Indian community all over South
Africa. The battle-ground has been temporarily removed from the
Transvaal to Natal. What applies to Durban applies to the whole Col-
ony, and what now applies to Natal may not improbably apply to South
Africa as a whole. Evil example is quickly followed.</p>

In past issues, we have devoted a considerable amount of space to the
discussion of Potchefstroomâs doings. We have done this, not so
much because of the importance of Potchefstroom as a centre of
opinion, as because we regard that town as typifying much that is
evil in South Africa in regard to the attitude adopted towards the
Indian community. English people are accustomed to view, with
unqualified abhorrence, the taking of the law into their own hands by
certain sections of the American people, when unfortunate negroes are
marty- rised under the unorthodox code known as âlynch lawâ.
Potchefst- room is evidently anxious to put itself beyond the pale of
British civilisation in like manner, for we read, with respect to the
building of a Mohamedan mosque in the town: âIf the Indians persist
in violating public feeling, there will probably be trouble over the
matter, as some strong expressions of opinion have been made use of.
What is legal is one thing, and what is likely to meet with
resentment is another.â Thus speaks our contemporary, the
<i>Potchefstroom Budget</i>. There can be no two readings of this
statement. It can only be regarded as a direct incitation to go
beyond what is permitted by the law. It has, we believe, been held
that the Potchefstroom Town Council is not legally empowered to
prevent the erection of the mosque. Can it be that our contemporary
has the rash courage to urge that the building of the mosque should
be prevented by other than legal means? That is not in</p>

almost inclined to wonder, despairingly, whether South Africans have
cast aside the foundation-principle of British national honour.</p>

We publish, in another column, a report from our Pietersburg
correspondent, together with correspondence that has passed between
the Employeesâ Association and the local British Indian Committee
on the question of early closing. It will be evident, from a perusal
of these documents, that there is a rather strong feeling existent in
Pie- tersburg on this subject. We have repeatedly pointed out that
invidious distinction is made between Asiatics and Europeans, in
matters of  trade especially, and again and again have we shown how
the white population has endeavoured to saddle the Indian community
with a share of responsibility and of penalty, whereas is has
carefully refrai- ned from granting them any measure of privilege.
Now it happens that human nature is so organised that deprivation of
privilege is not considered, by those who are deprived, as an
equivalent to equality of responsibility or imposition of burden and
it cannot be wondered at that, in such circumstances, the Indian
community has frequently refused to accept obligations thrust upon it
by the white inhabitants who persist in refusing equality of
opportunity. The Pietersburg Indian traders, as a matter of fact, did
fall in with the wishes and desi- res of their white fellow-traders,
so long as the latter imposed upon them no special disabilities. But
when the white traders commenced their methods of boycott and
ostracism, the Indian traders began to perceive that they must
consider themselves apart from the rest of the community. The sequel
is to be found in this  correspondence  to which we make reference.
The white traders must alter their mode of procedure if they wish the
Indian merchants to abide by the conven- tion they would set up.
There must be give and take on both sides.</p>

In another column of this issue will be found an extract from a
lengthy report, appearing in the <i>Johannesburg Star </i>of the 4th

Coloured subjects of the Crown in the Transvaal, when framing the
Constitution that is now in process of being. We can only say that
the Coloured community has our fullest sympathy in its endeavour to
escape from political oblivion. Time was when the late Mr. Rhodes
uttered his famous dictum that the franchise should be given to every
civilised man south of the Zambesi. That ideal seems, in these latter
days, to be rapidly falling into disrepute. It is unfashionable, now
a days, to be guilty of having on ideal, and a crime to be so
shameless as, having one, to act in accordance with it. We have seen
only recently how a Native Commission has issued an official report,
in which the recommendation is made that Coloured people, already
enfranchised, should retain their franchise rights only in State
elections, but should lose them in the event of elections for a
Federal Parliament. The manifest injustice of this needs no emphasis.
It is much at one with the general attitude adopted by the white
population of South Africa towards the non-white. In matters of
Colour prejudice, it is, unfortun- ately, almost impossible to
convince by logical argument. Where blind prejudice rules, of the
Transvaal will have to wait long before they succeed in securing the
recognition of what we conceive to be their just rights. We trust
that they will continue to protest against ill-consi- dered treatment
and to urge the inherent justice of their demands.</p>

The Johannesburg Town Council could not bear to see the Kaffirs
riding bicycles like the whites, and therefore passed, at its last
meeting, a resolution to the effect that a Kaffir who had a permit to
own a bicycle must wear on his left arm, while riding in the city, a
badge with the number on it, easily visible.</p>

The Transvaal administration is nowadays carried on in such a manner
that this resolution causes us no surprise. We write about it to- day
only to remind our Indian brethren<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>though
we do not think it quite necessary<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>that
present-day Johannesburg is far different from the Johannesburg of
pre-war days. Most of the people how now hold the reins of power were
known, before the outbreak of the war, as Uitl- anders, and were
always quick to raise an outcry demanding justice for themselves.
Foreign nationals called themselves British subjects and made all
possible efforts to secure for themselves the rights enjo- yed by the
British. In this, the English, the Russians, the Germans and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
others were all one and united. The Boers were then the rulers,
against whom these people used to complain vociferously that they did
not administer justice equitably. These were the very British
subjects, who first incited the Boer Government against Indians, and
later questioned its authority to legislate against them. It was
again these British sub- jects who at last got Lord Milner and Mr.
Chamberlain to go to war with the Boers. It was these self-same
British subjects who during the war went about trumpeting that, when
the war was over, true justice would be done, and all discrimination
based on race or colour would be eliminated from the Statute-book.
This was the first act of the dramas.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 86%">
In the second act, everything was forgotten, and these very British
subjects became engrossed in serving their own interests. Then
followed the third act, in which open enmity to the Indians began to
be manifested. And in the fourth act, which is being staged now, opp-
ressive laws are being passed and put into execution with the utmost
rigour.</p>

All this must redound to the credit of these very British subjects.
As on the Indians, so also on the Kaffirs and the Coloured people,
the attack is bound to come without fail. They should, therefore,
take heed that, if the one is attacked, the other, too, is bound,
sooner or later, to meet the same fate. It will not be very
surprising if the rule enacted today for the Kaffirs is applied
tomorrow to the Indians.</p>

The queer thing about it is that those who are clamouring for this
atrocious legislation have themselves been aliens who only a brief
while ago began to call themselves British subjects. Mr. Langermann<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>spoke at length on this resolution and, in the heat of
his eloquence, forgot even the colour of the Kaffir, sending the
house into fits of laughter. He argued that the badge should be worn
in front, so that the Kaffir might not pass for a white! It is given
to Mr. Langermann alone to express such thoughts; and we congratulate
him on the suggestion that, in the absence of the badge in front, the
Kaffirs might be mis- taken for whites! But, for a proper
appreciation of what Mr. Lange- rmann said, it would be useful to
know something about him. Mr. Langermann feels very deeply for his
Russian brethren and, therefore, criticises the Russian Government a
great deal. It is the law of nature that a man, brought up under
tyranny, forgets, on becoming free, his own miserable days, abuses
his newly acquired freedom and even becomes cruel. It is, therefore,
small wonder that the gentlemen who came from Poland and have
recently been converted into British subjects should lose their
balance.</p>

The only matter for satisfaction during the discussion on the
resolution was that Messers. Mackie Niven, Quinn, Rockey, and Pim did
not forget that the Kaffirs, too, were human being and raised their
voice [of protest] against their unwarranted humiliation. But theirs
was a cry in the wilderness. Nevertheless, they deserve our respect
for giving expression to their true thoughts unmindful of popular
senti- ment.</p>

The report by Inspector Keyne on the condition of the slaug-
hter-houses in the Cape Colony, just out, is worth perusal. He says
that, of the slaughter-houses inspected by him, one or two were
extremely dirty. On the main road in Meadland, he found entrails and
fat hung against the wall from a hook. Blood and offal had got stuck
to the wall to a height of four feet above the ground. He found that
the common practice of the place was to lime-wash the walls over the
accumulated layers of waste matter, and this had resulted in solid
accretions of lime and refuse on the walls. The men working there
were very slovenly, their clothes dirty and covered over with layers
of grease. These often came in contact with the meat.</p>

Needless to say, all this has been found in slaughter-houses run and
managed by the whites, too. The question arises how such offen- ces
have remained undetected all these days. Who can tell the number of
people who must have been taken ill by eating the meat produced in
such insanitary places? What would be the consequence if Indians were
responsible for such a state? The whites would have at once resorted
to lawlessness and demanded that not only the offenders, but the
entire Indian community should be banished or severe restrictions
imposed on it. But, fortunatley for us, such uncleanliness has been
found in shops belonging to the whites. Let us see how the
authorities deal with the matter.</p>

Sir Henry Cotton, who presided over the recent session of the Indian
National Congress, had requested H. E. the Viceroy for an appointment
to place before him personally all the resolutions passed at the
Congress session. But the Viceroy refused either to see Sir Henry as
the President of the Congress, or let him submit the resolu- tions.
However, to show that he meant no affront to Sir Henry perso- nally,
Lord Curzon agreed to see him as a private gentleman. This only means
that Lord Curzon feels no compunction in hurling an insult at the
Congress. It appears from <i>India </i>that the reason for his
refusing to see Sir Henry was that, if once the Viceroy saw him, he
would have to see his successors, too, in the future. Earlier Lord
Lans- downe<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>had also on similar grounds refused to see the
Presidents of the Congress. How, then, could Lord Curzon violate the
precedent already established? The thought never occurred to His
Excellency that, by his strict adherence to precedent, he was
offending the feel- ings of millions of people. Nevertheless, there
is no doubt that the Congress that has lived these twenty years will
live on and grow from day to day.</p>

The <i>Government Gazette </i>publishes the rules and regulations
framed by the Cape Town Municipality for barbers. Under the rules
every barberâs shop is liable a medical inspection. Every barber is
required to keep his shop tidy. The scissors, razors and other imple-
ments used for one customer must not be used for another without
being cleaned. Brushes, etc., should be properly washed and kept
clean. A fresh towel must be used for every customer. When a person
suffering from disease is given a shave or has his hair cut, the same
instruments should not be used again before being washed clean with
an antiseptic liquid. A defaulter is liable to a fine of up to Â£5.
Officials have been authorised to inspect and find out whether these
rules are properly observed or not. By themselves, the rules are

would be very difficult to enforce them. But now that the rules are
there, they are likely to exercise some check on the barbers. We see
such rules for the first time in the Cape Town Municipality; and they
are likely to be introduced in other places also. Indian barbers will
be well advised to heed the warning. There is not doubt that the
condit- ions in shops owned by Indian barbers needs to be improved.
The implements and towels are not too clean. It does take a little
time to attend to their cleanliness, but it does not involve any
expense. If the tools and implements are kept free of dirt and in
proper trim, they last longer, and clean towels, etc., promote
custom. Even many of the white barbers keep their instruments, etc.,
unclean; but we need not view with them in undesirable matters.</p>

We quote elsewhere from an editorial in the <i>Rand </i><i>Ratepayersâ

contemporary has hit the nail exactly on the head. The article is
written by a man who, unlike some petty politicians in South Africa,
can keep in mind the true proportion of things when dealing with this
matter. It is a momentous one, for, if South Africa endorse an
un-British anti-Asiatic policy, the consequences may be very grave.
But we cannot believe that our statesmen, in the consideration of
local affairs, will lose sight of Imperial interests. We ourselves
attach no more importance to the anti-Asiatic crusade than does our
contemporary; for one has only to look at the facts of the case to
see what little basis there is for agitation of this character. The
origin of the whole matter is trade jealousy. It is this petty motive
alone that animates the anti-Indian movement; and it is perfectly
apparent to all who are not blinded by colour prejudice. The <i>Review

European needs? Why, then, charge the Indian with this virtue as if
it were a crime? The fact of the matter is that the European detests
his Indian competitor because he himself is not permitted to gain
exorbitant profits by making the consumer pay inflated prices for his
com- modities. If the anti-Asiatics gain the victory, the person who
will suffer most is the white consumer. Let South Africans remember
that.</p>

Another argument used to bolster up the anti-Asiatic position is that
Indians are a danger to the public health. This may or may not be so;

Indians have everywhere in South Africa proved themselves specially
amenable to health regulations. This was shewn, beyond all
controversy, by the remarkable manner in which the whole commu- nity
submitted itself to the plague authorities during the recent outbr-
eak in Johannesburg.</p>

Another charge that has been brought against Indians is that they did
not fight for the Empire during the late South African war. The
ignorance of the framers of this charge is typical; for, with the
exception of themselves, the whole world knows that Indians were as
ready to fight and, if need be, to die for the Empire as any other of
its children, but were not permitted to do so. There are some people
who know that the Indians of Natal and the Transvaal again and again
petitioned the Natal Government to be allowed to go to the front âin
any capacityâ. And there are some also who know that, of all the
best of the British Army, the leaders of the Natal Indian Volunteer
Ambu- lance Corps<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1    </font></sup>were
the only ones who served and refused all  remu- neration.</p>

The fact is, there are men among the Indian community who are more
British than the majority of the anti-Asiatics and who have their
full share of that patriotic and public spirit which  has  made the
Empire what it is. It is absurd to suppose that men, aware of their
status as British subjects, will meekly allow themselves to be
relegated to âBazaarsâ or âLocationsâ nay, more, it is
criminal to attempt to destroy this patriotic spirit. And it is
equally foolish to expect them to be crushed by methods of
misrepresentation, injustice, and intimida- tion. The attitude of the
anti-Asiatics in South Africa can be summed up in one word: give a
dog a bad name and hang him.</p>

We regret that there are still Indian in Durban who do not yet know
the serious consequences of concealing infectious disease. On Monday
last, an Indian employed by the Durban Corporation was sentenced to
pay a fine of Â£ 20, or, in default, to three monthâs hard labour,
for concealing a case of plague. The sentence is exemplary, and
rightly so. The case was that of a girl, who was removed to an empty
house by her father, so soon as he found she was sick. The reason he
gave the Magistrate was that he did not want the European doctors to
take her away from him. That, perhaps, was very natural; but Indians
must learn that, in this matter, they are under the same law as
Europeans. Each case of infectious disease must be notified to the
authorities, whoever the sufferer may be; and everyone, whether he be
Indian or European, has to put his own private feelings into  his 
pocket, for the general good. It is too much to expect that every
Indian of the indentured class will look at the matter from this
point of view, but it is not too much to expect that Indians of the
higher class will assist Dr. Murison in dealing with disease. We
again call attention to the Health Officerâs letter in our issue of
Dec. 10th., and to our remarks thereon. Our Indian friends must
remember that every prosecution of this kind reflects, however
undeservedly, on the whole community. But the fault does not lie only
on the side of the Indians. We cannot agree with <i>The </i><i>Natal
Mercury </i>that âit is due to the action of certain Indians that
the plague is still with usâ. It is true that Indians are generally
the victims of this dread disease. But, as in answer to the question,
âWho breeds our plagues?â a correspondent very pertinently
replied in our columns last week, âWho puts the In- dian under such
circumstances as to make him a breeder of plagues?â</p>

There are âplague spotsâ in Durban under the direct control of
the Town Council: why, then, lay all the blame on the poor Indian,
if, as a natural consequence, plague is developed? The matter is,
indeed, too important to be lightly dismissed, and we propose to deal
fully with the whole question of municipal sanitation in a succeeding
issue.</p>

Sheth Hoondamalâs licence has been a subject of discussion for the
past several months. Our readers are aware that Sheth Hoondamal has
been carrying on trade in Durban for nearly ten years. At first he
opened a shop in West Street, one of the principal thoroughfares of
Durban. As the landlord wanted to get the building repaired, he had
the shop vacated. Not being able to get a place to his liking in West
Street, Sheth Hoodamal secured a good shop in nearby Grey Street and
started his business there. Some months later, on being required to
vacate the premises, he rented from an Indian landlord a better and
larger shop in West Street which had been recently vacated by an
Indian merchant, and began to trade there. Simultaneously, he applied
to the Licensing Officer to have his new address entered  on  his
licence. Not only did that Officer reject his application, but he
also charged Hoondamal with trading without a licence. Legal
proceedings were instituted against him in a Magistrateâs Court,
and Sheth Hoon- damal was fined. The latter thereupon appealed
against the Magis- trateâs judgment. Before this appeal could be
heard, the Town Council dragged Sheth Hoondamal to the Magistrateâs
Court twice or thrice, and each time the Magistrate fined him, and on
one occasion the Magistrate, Mr. Stuart, even exceeded his authority
and passed an illegal order, asking Sheth Hoondamal to close down his
shop. The latter, of course, disregarded the order as it was illegal;
and through his attorney, Mr. Wyllie, sent a strongly worded note to
the Magistrate and the police, saying that, if the order was
implemented, the exec- uting officials would be held responsible for
the consequences. The Magistrate was greatly enraged at this, but he
was helpless, the order not being lawful. The appeal was heard by the
Circuit Court when it sat in Durban, and Sheth Hoondamal was found
not guilty. Thereafter, the police brought another charge against
him, and the Magistrate found him guilty.</p>

The appeal against that judgment was heard by the Supreme Court this
month, and to the misfortune of the Indian traders, the jud- ges gave
their decision against Sheth Hoondamal. Sheth Hoondamal</p>

had applied last month for a licence for the current year, which the
Licensing Officer rejected. An appeal was then field before the Town
Council. Stating the reason for not granting Sheth Hoondamal a lice-
nce, the Licensing Officer said that it was not desirable to issue
more licences to Asiatics in West Street ! When this reason for
refusal was brought to the Knowledge of the Town Council by Sheth
Hoonda- malâs counsel, the Councillors naturally felt abashed, for
the Licen- sing Officer had also added that such was the desire of
the Councillors as well. On hearing this, Mr. Burne, who is a member
of the Council and also a renowned lawyer, immediately protested that
the Licensing Officer had no warrant to attribute such a desire to
the Town Council. At this the Officer got up and answered that he had
rejected applicat- ions on the same ground in the past, and that his
decision had always been endorsed by the Council; his claim could not
 be  proved incorrect. To prevent this dispute from developing
further, a Council- lor moved that the appeal be dismissed. Another
member seconded the resolution, introducing while doing so a further
legalistic argume- nt that under the law the discretion to grant or
refuse licences was ves- ted in the Licensing Officer. After hearing
this point of law, the appli- cantâs counsel answered that even
this discretion could only be exer- cised in accordance with the law,
and that it was no discretion which violated the law or transgressed
it. The Councillors did not relish this argument. Consequently, Sheth
Hoondamal was not granted a licence and has had to close down his
shop.</p>

There was submitted, at the ordinary monthly meeting of the Durban
Town Council, on the 7th inst., a Report by the Inspector of
Nuisances relative to the Eastern and Western Vleis. It is noteworthy
that this official makes reference to certain areas, the buildings on
which are variously described as dilapidated and imperfect as to
sani- tation and building characteristics, whilst the ground itself
is said to be undrained. These buildings, moreover, are declared to
be âused for habitable purposesâ, and also âunfit for human
habitationâ.</p>

We are forcibly reminded of a meeting held, under the auspices of the
Natal Indian Congress, in June of 1903, when emphasis was laid upon
an allegation made in the Minute, submitted by the Mayor to the Town
Council, concerning the insanitary habits of the Indian popula- tion,
and urging this as one of several reasons why Indians should be
relegated to Locations, or, as they have been euphemistically
designa- ted, âBazaarsâ.</p>

Lord Milner, it will be remembered, in his memorable Notice No. 356
of 1903, drew special attention to the exception that was to be made
in respect of Asiatics whose habits of life and social qualities were
not repugnant to European ideas or in conflict with sanitary laws. We
venture to suggest that any doctor or hospital nurse will confirm our
assertion that, even amongst higher-class Europeans, scientific
sanitation is not always favourably regarded. That, however, is by
the way. The real point is that it is not always just that the
<i>general </i><i>opinion </i>of Europeans, who are often most
ignorant of what they are most assured, and as often prejudiced
against conditions and circumstances that are strange to them, should
be taken as a reasonable criterion. The opinion of the man in the
street is, notoriously, vastly different from, and often opposed to,
the opinion of the man in the study, who has greater and more
frequent opportunity of collecting, sifting and judging the facts of
which he speaks.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 95%">
There are Indians and Indians; there are Indians who approach
absolutely to the scientific European standard of sanitation, and
there are Indians who have not yet adopted other modes of sanitation
than those to which they have been accustomed, almost from time
immem- orial, in the remote districts of India. Similar distinctions
may, indeed, be made amongst the inhabitants of civilised nations the
world over. There is always, and will be for long years to come, this
difference between the educated and the ill-instructed.</p>

When, then, we hear the charge so frequently levelled against the
Indian that he is insanitary, we are impelled to ask: âWhich Indian
do you mean? And do you refer to personal cleanliness or to domi-
ciliary sanitation?â For nothing is more important than that those
who bring a charge of this impalpable nature should be pinned down to
something more definite and less dangerously vague. It is a common
observation that a generalisation is often a successful catchword to
throw to an unthinking man, whereas a definite statement  of  fact
would crush him.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; line-height: 95%">
It is our experience that, generally speaking, the Indian is not
insanitary. It must be distinctly borne in mind that we do not assert
that no Indians are insanitary. We argue from a knowledge of the
national customs and traditions of the various Indian peoples, and
can confidently say that, be these Hindus or Mohamedans, their faith,
which is a living one to them, inculcates absolute principles of
perso- nal cleanliness and, as a corollary, domestic sanitation, even
amongst the lowest classes, and this may easily be confirmed by any
one who is at all conversant with the normal conditions of Indian
life.</p>

But what have we? We have the Eastern and the Western Vleis! We have

The question of sanitation as a whole, in so far as the Indian co-
mmunity is affected, has been already dealt with<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

disease that is claiming its unfor- tunate victims epidemically, and
to discuss the effect of that cause.</p>

In last Saturdayâs <i>Mercury</i>, there appeared a lengthy
paragraph dealing with the attitude said to be adopted by âthe
Indiansâ towards the authorities, especially in reference to the
concealment of plague- sickness. The writer made a number of
curiously inadequate stateme- nts, upon which he based several
somewhat querulous enquiries, and concluded by suggesting that
âpossibly this conduct (concealment of plague) has much to do with
the recrudescence of the disease occa- sionallyâ.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; line-height: 95%">
What are the plain facts? We have a community composed of whites and
Indians, the poor of the former section being, proportiona- tely,
fewer than those of the latter. It follows, then, that the poorer
folk amongst the Asiatic population are more liable, numerically, to
disease than are the poorer Europeans. Next, we have an assertion
made that âthe Indiansâ seriously hamper the authorities âby
refusing to give information and in every way endeavouring to conceal

abouts of any suffersâ. Again we ask, âWhat Indians?â Surely,
it is not intended to saddle the <i>whole </i>Indian community with
the fault of a few of its most ignorant section. Why are these
careless generalisations made? Is it not possible to impress upon the
intelligent public the fact that there are as many subtle
sub-divisions amongst Indians as amon- gst any other civilised
people? It is almost disheartening to observe how these
mis-statements continue to be made, with an utter irrespons- ibility
that makes one wonder whether the facts of history are ever conned
and become a part of our present-day philosophy.</p>

The higher-class Indians never cease, both by personal example and by
precept, to impress upon their less-favoured brethren the necessity
of co-operating with the authorities in order that the effort to
stamp out the fell disease, that is now rife amongst us, may not
prove abortive. Over and over again, we ourselves have, in our
leading columns, both in English and in the vernacular tongues, done
our best to point the moral that âCleanliness is next to
Godlinessâ. And yet we have foolish people asking why âthe
Indiansâ do not co-operate with the authorities !</p>

Moreover, if, class for class, a comparison be made between Europeans
and Indians, it will, we feel assured, be found that there is no
greater frequency of concealment, no greater reluctance to adver-
tise cases of plague, amongst the latter than amongst the former. We
do not lay special stress upon this fact, nor do we care to use the
<i>tu </i><i>quoque </i>argument. We are, however, compelled to do so
in self- defence, for it is distinctly unfair to suggest that such
conduct on the part of a few Indians, which no one deplores more than
we ourselves, âbadly prejudicesâ the Indian Community âin the
eyes of Euro- peansâ. There is, however, one important reason why
cases of con- cealment do occur. We are informed that, at the plague
hospital, no distinction is made between Indians and Kaffirs, all
being herded together indiscriminately. Anyone with even the
slightest knowledge of Indian habits and prejudices will at once see
how great a factor this negligence is in impending the good work
initiated by the authorities. We can only say that, so long as no
separate  accommodation  is allotted to Indians as such, and so long
as no differentiations of creed and caste are made amongst the
Indians themselves, with due regard to religious customs and
traditional beliefs, so long will the authorities cope in vain with
many of the difficulties that could, with a little foresight, be
easily avoided.</p>

We have already shown, in part, how and why insanitary con- ditions
are created for the poorer Indians. Plague has again broken out in
Durban. Who are the first victims? Indians. But, we ask, pertin-
ently, <i>what </i>Indians? Who are these Indians? None other than
those</p>

employed, housed, and âcared forâ by the Corporation of the
Borough that prides itself upon being the model borough of South
Africa! These Indians are employed by the Corporation to perform the
filthiest work. They are used to clean drains and sewers, and in
every possible unsavoury pursuit<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>and
are âhousedâ in âsanitaryâ quarters like the Eastern and the
Western Vleis. What wonder, then, that these unfortunates are liable
to contract this and every other dirt disease? The Sanitary
Commissionâs Report, to which fuller reference has been made
elsewhere, describes, realistically enough, the horrible surroundings
amidst which these wretched people are compelled to perpetuate a
degraded existence. And, when plague not unnaturally breaks out
amongst them, although complaint after complaint has been directed to
the authorities by the Indian community, and by the experts appointed
by those same authorities, the Indians, without distinction, are
blamed, for insanitary habits, and âthe coolieâ is incontinently
dubbed a breeder of disease. A man that is made to live in a pigsty
is not unlikely to become as filthy in his habits as is its rightful
denizen. Dr. Turner, the Medical Officer of Health for the Transvaal,
when speaking in the Legislative Council regarding the condition of
the Johannesburg Indian Location, remarked:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: -0.07cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 96%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The
coolie location at Johannesburg was in a disgraceful condition, and
why? Because those poor people were compelled to live in it, like
chickens in a coop, and it was left in a most insanitary condition by
the authorities. If Mr. Raitt (M.L.C.) had been compelled to live in
it, he would have been just as dirty.</font></font></p>

We are obliged to say, with regret, that the culprit, in the case of
insanitation, is the Corporation itself, upon which is the guilty
respons- ibility for the awful conditions that are known to exist
upon its own property and for the deaths that have taken place from
the plague. It is deliberately drawing a red herring across the
trail, in the light of these facts, to accuse the Indian community,
or even the wretched âcoolieâ, of insanitary habits and wilful
lack effort to co-operate with the powers that be to remedy the
evils.</p>

We have to express our acknowledgements to the plague experts that
have been employed by the Government and the Corporation. They have
done their best to have the evils remedied, and have offered
recommendations, but all to no purpose. It is quite useless seizing
upon an effect and regarding it as a cause. None the less, it remains
an effect, and the cause, being quite other than what it is reported
to be, is still to seek.</p>

We recommend that our readers carefully study the newspapers coming
these days from India, for that will convince them how our brethren
there are ready to rush to our succour. At the Congress session
recently held in Bombay, there was a very good discussion of the
disabilities and hardships we are experiencing here, and the spee-
ches made there by our representatives created such a strong impress-
ion upon that august body that the leaders have begun to realise the
gravity of our problem and to make efforts to improve our con-
dition. Even the Press has taken up our case with vigour. All this is
very satisfactory, and we should be thankful to God that the
represen- tatives of the Indian people themselves have turned their
attention to the redress of our grievances. We should, therefore, be
prepared to discharge our duties with greater enthusiasm. The
proverbs go, âGod helps those who help themselves,â and âYou
cannot go to heaven without dying yourselfâ. Likewise we needs must
do our duty and, if we do not, our subject will not be fulfilled. The
greater the help we receive from others, the greater should be the
intensity of our own efforts; for such help adds to our
responsibility. It is but natural that we should struggle to remove
our hardships. If we did not, we would be considered worse than
beasts. When there are people coming for- ward to help us, we must
also think of our duty towards them, and red- ouble our efforts and
work with greater ardour and enthusiasm, so that they may be
satisfied, encouraged and feel that we are not unworthy of their
goodness. By proving our worth, we shall add to their zeal, doing
ourselves a service in the process. Even an utterly worldly man will
realise the truth of this. More so, those who are religious-minded.</p>

It is, therefore, our earnest appeal to all our Indian brethren in
South Africa that they should ponder over what has been said above,
and be prepared to do their duty. When the Indian leaders are ready
to help us, it is our obvious duty to arm them with the means of
doing</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.27cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
so; for we must know that, if we do not do so, they will not be able
to render us the assistance they would like to. The following three
things are at present needed: (1) we should keep up our efforts; (2)
we should keep them informed of the true state of our affairs; and
(3) we should provide them with sufficient funds to defray the
expenses they might have to incur for carrying on any activities on
our behalf. All the three things are quite necessary. The first two
we are already doing to some extent; that is our own efforts are
continuing more or less; and we do publicise the true facts. As for
the third item, viz., the funds, we have not done anything so far. It
is, therefore, necessary to give full thought to this without delay.
Supplying the necessary funds is like arming them with a very potent
weapon. In the modern world, money is needed at every step; and if it
runs short, one has to face dis- appointment in the end, however
great and noble oneâs hopes and aspirations might be. Just as man
needs food, so does public work re- quire money. Those who would help
us would give their valuable time and gladly exert themselves, but if
we tighten our purse-strings when they need money, we would be
considered mean and contemptible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 95%">
We should consider how our leaders can help us; and with our
experience in this country, it should not be difficult to think of
the means. We have learnt, from experience, how to achieve our aims
under British rule. The Transvaalers, when they willed it, forced a
war; and now, when they so will it, they can cause us a lot of
harassment. How do they do this? They hold meetings at different
places to can- vass public support for their views; since it is not
always possible for the whole community to attend the meetings, they
launch newspapers and go on writing, day in and day out, whatever
they like; they also issue pamphlets and write open letters to the
Press, they draft petitions, get them printed and obtain a sufficient
number of signatures on them; and they send out telegrams to
publicise their activities. To do all this, money is essential, and
their leaders, therefore, do not hesitate to relieve their purses a
little. And though these people are powerful, intelligent and united
and wield great influence here as well as in England, they always go
on making efforts tactfully to gain their obj- ective avoiding
obstacles. It is such men we have to contend with. We are weak, less
intelligent, and unable to unite, not knowing the full significance
of unity. We have no influence with the Government and there is a
deplorable lack of thought and the enthusiasm necessary to show our
mettle. How, then, can we put up a fight? As against our
shortcomings, we have justice on our side; and justice can discomfit
the opponent. However, to gain the final victory, we must certainly
show our mettle and worth, for, in the absence of these qualities,
jus- tice itself gets weakened.</p>

Fortunatley for us, there are in India at the moment several men of
position and prestige from this country, through whom help should be
rendered to the Indian leaders. We should give all the monetary help
possible from every part of South Africa, particularly from Natal and
the Transvaal, and so back the Indian leaders that, in conformity
with British practice, they might ventilate the peopleâs feelings
in the matter and demand justice from the Government. Things do not
cost as much in India as they do here. The country being poor, a
little money would be enough. But the country is very large. Our
leaders here should therefore take all these facts into consideration
and do their obvious duty without delay. That is to say, they should
immedia- tely send respectable sums of money to India so that the
enthusiasm of the Indian leaders might not cool down, and they might
carry on ceaseless agitation throughout the country by issuing
pamphlets and holding meetings. This would also mean that the Indian

The Cape <i>Government Gazette </i>publishes the text of a Bill to
regulate the trade of a general dealer. We can understand the regula-
tion of dealersâ licences, but that the Law should regulate the
trade of the dealers also is an idea altogether novel. We reproduce
the opera- tive clauses of the Bill in another column. It contains in
all 35 sections, most of which could, more or less, have been
avoided; but we must, at the same time, confess that, though the Bill
is drastic enough, it shows on the part of the framers great regard
for the interests of the general dealers, and in that respect it is
undoubtedly less open to objection than the Natal Act. According to
the Bill, all the present licence-hold- ers are protected unless they
have committed breaches of the law reg- arding Sunday trading, the
selling of spirituous liquor, or sanitation, or unless the premises
have been allowed to become a nuisance to the neighbourhood by reason
of the habits of the dealerâs customers, his associates or himself.
With reference to the new licence, a Resident Magistrate may issue a
certificate enabling by the Licensing Court. Both the Magistrate and
the Licensing Court have the power to refuse the licence on grounds,
<i>inter alia</i>, of the character of the applicant, of his
inability to write in some European languages, or to keep intellig-
ible records of his transactions. There is, too, the power granted to
the</p>

licence-holder, in the event of his licence being cancelled, to
appeal to the Supreme Court, except when the cancellation has taken
place by reason of conviction under the Liquor Act. The most
objectionable clause throughout the Bill is with reference to the
European langu- ages. The habitual affront to the millions of British
Indians and their cultured languages that such a provision implies
renders it necessary for the British Indians at the Cape to oppose
the Bill, which otherwise they could have gladly assented to. The
importation of such vexatious provisions is not calculated to gain
the co-operation of the Indians. We cannot understand why a man, who
is a capable merchant, thoro- ughly honest, and able to keep his
books in the English lan-guage through outside assistance, should be
debarred from obtaining a lic- ence. We could point out scores of
miserable shanties, in every way a disgrace to any town of
importance, owned by those who have a knowledge of âsome European
languageâ. Why should they get a licence, and a well-behaved Indian
subject, having business premises in a perfectly sanitary condition,
and bearing an unexceptionable cha- racter, be insulated by having it
flung in his face that he is unfit be- cause he does not know a
European language? We trust that the Bri- tish Indians at the Cape
will co-operate in resisting this fresh attempt at imposing a burden
on them, and that the Government will see their way to expunge from
the Bill the objectionable clause, and thus secure the active
co-operation of a large body of the traders concerned.</p>

Supreme Court has done deliberate injustice; but we do believe that,
if an appeal is preferred to the Privy Council against the decision
of the Supreme Court, the result would, in all probability, be
favourable to the Indian traders. Had the intention of the
legislators been what the Supreme Court holds it to have been, the
question arises why the licence form originally required only the
name of the town and not the actual place or locality. The practice
of mentioning the locality was introduced subsequently, and that fact
is by itself  an answer to the decision of the Supreme Court. But it
is not necessary at present to go into legal niceties. It is,
however, necessary to realise that the licensing law is on the whole
disastrous to the Indian traders; and</p>

Let us now consider what should be done immediately. Perfectly
reliable information should be gathered from every place as  to
whether or not Indians received regular licences at the beginning of
the year; and this information should be made as widely known as
possible. The leaders of the community should ponder over this infor-
mation and take the necessary steps in regard to it. All facts should
be communicated to those working on our behalf in India and Great
Britain, so that, as our local efforts progress, parallel attempts to
stren- gthen our cause might also be made there. Unless and until
work pro- ceeds in this way, it is, in our opinion, futile to hope
for any improve- ment in the condition of our traders. We should
remember that it was as a result of similar efforts made by us in
1898 that the Colonial Secretary here, acting on Mr. Chamberlainâs
strong despatch, wrote confidentially in 1899 to all Municipalities
in Natal warning them that, if the Indian traders were harassed, the
law would have to be altered and the demand of the Indians for the
right of appeal to the Supreme Court conceded. Soon after, war broke
out and everything came to a stand still. Now that the mischief has
started again, there is the greatest need for us to be vigilant.
Bearing this incident in mind, we should do our work courageously. If
we go on doing our duty properly, we are sure to succeed in the end.</p>

Continuing, the lecturer described what was meant by the title
âHinduâ, referring it to the branch of the Aryan people that had
migrated to the trans-Indus districts of India, and had colonised
that vast country. As a matter of fact, Aryanism would have been a
better descriptive word than Hinduism, is explanation of the faith
accepted by so many millions of his countrymen.</p>

One of the most remarkable characteristics of the religion professed
by Hindus was self-abnegation, and this was obviously shown in the
name of the religion itself, for, unlike most of the great world
religions, it did not derive its name from any prophet or teacher,
although it counted some of the greatest within is fold. The lecturer
further instanced the historic siege of Arcot in support of this con-
tention, when the Indian soliders, at a time when starvation faced
the whole British Army, waived their claim to the rice rations in
favour of the British soldiers, they themselves being content to have
the water in which the rice had been boiled, although it was
customary to throw this water away; and also the case of Prabhu
Singh,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>an indentured British Indian, who was chosen for the
post of honour of warning the inhabitants of Ladysmith during the
siege, whenever a Boer shell was coming, by ringing a bell when
perched in a tree, at imminent risk to himself. This man was
mentioned several times in despatches by Sir George White.</p>

The Hindus themselves claimed that the date of their scriptures was
veiled in the mist of antiquity, the scriptures themselves being
God-given. As against that, some Europeans contended that the scrip-
tures were not more than 3,000 or 4,000 years old. Mr. Tilak, a well-
known Indian Sanskritist, has, however, calculated that, from certain
astronomical observations made in these works, they were at least
10,000 years old, although they were only committed to writing some
three hundred years after Christ. The <i>Vedas</i>, as these
scriptures were known, consisted of separate hymns, each being held
to cover a defi- nite period, and quite independent of each other.
And, typically, not one authorâs name had passed down to posterity!

Over two hundred millions of people professed Hinduism, and this
faith entered into their every act. The key-note of Hinduism on the
spiritual side was <i>moksha</i>, or salvation; that is, the final
absorption of the Soul in the Infinite Soul that pervades all things.
In regard to religion, pantheism was the chief characteristic,
whilst, on the ethical plane, self-abnegation was the most notable
quality, with its corollary, toleration. In social matters, the
characteristic of caste was predomin- ant, whilst the ceremonial
characteristic was the sacrificing of animals. At a time when the
faith of the Hindus had become more formal, Prince Gautama Buddha,
having learnt the spiritual worth of things during a prolonged period
of contemplation, commenced to teach that animal sacrifices were
despiritualising, and that the highest from of love was expressed by
extending that toleration, which was already a tenet of their faith,
in the direction of refraining from killing or otherwise detroying
living things. Hinduism had never, as a religion, been missionary, as
were Christianity and Mahomedanism, but, under King Ashoka, the
Buddhist priests were sent far and wide to propagate the new belief.
Buddhism had a reforming effect upon Hinduism, somewhat similar to
that of Protestantism upon Catholicism, but there was a great
difference in the spirit underlying that reform. No Hindu bore the
Buddhist any ill-will, a statement that could not be made in
reference to the Protestants and Catholics. Buddhism was sometimes
said to have declined in India. This was not really so. The Buddhist
priests had endeavoured to propagate their faith too zealously, and
had aroused the jealously, at the time, of the Hindu priesthood, who
had driven the Buddhists to the outskirts of the country, to Tibet,
China, Japan, Burma and Ceylon. But the spirit of the Buddhists rem-
ained in India, and actuated every principle professed by the Hindus.</p>

In this connection, the lecturer briefly referred to Jainism as a
most interesting form of faith. The Jains claimed that it was
altogether independent of Buddhism, not a growth from it. Unlike
others, they did not claim for the faith that it was of Divine
origin, recognising that its sacred writings were the results of
human workmanship. Jainism was, <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

The Medical Officer of Potchefstroom, at the instance of the Town
Council, has prepared a report on the condition of the Indian
quarters in that town. The circumstances under which it was prepared
are rather peculiar. As our readers are aware,  the  Potchefstroom,
people are very much exercised over the proposed erection of a mos-
que by the Indian Mahomedans. At the Town Council meeting where, in
spite of legal opinion to the contrary, the Councillors decided to
oppose the erection of the mosque, they also passed a resolution
instructing the Medical Officer to make an inspection of that part of</p>

the town and report at once to the Council. One would think there is
absolutely no connection between the erection of the mosque<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>which
is purely and simply a building devoted to religious worship and
which is never used as a dwelling place<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>and
the sanitary condition of the surrounding houses. However, the Town
Council of Potchefst- room, like the wolf in the fable, wanted some
charge to go on with. The Medical Officer, Dr. Friel<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>faithful
servant that he is to the Town Council<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>has
risen to the occasion and submitted a report, according to their
desire, which is a curious document. The Doctor says:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: -0.07cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">The
premises were on the whole fairly clean, but if any epidemic broke
out, it would be very difficult to disinfect them, as they largely
consist of a patch- work of shanties of all shapes and sizes.</font></font></p>

The question naturally arises: what has the Officer been doing all
this time? The plague has been in the Transvaal now for a year, and
these premises have not been found a source of danger. To-day, they
are found to be an urgent danger to the town, and must be dealt with
at once, not to prevent the plague, but<font face="Symbol, serif">â</font>the
building of a mosque! This would be ludicrous, were it not so openly
dishonest. The doctor says there were sanitary conveniences in each
of the premises; but as a statement of this description is very
damaging to the cause of the Town Council, he must, forsooth, add
that in most cases the bath water is thrown on the street. He does
not say how many of the European in Potchefstroom also throw their
bath water on the street, and on our own part we strongly suspect the
Indians who do so have no other course open to them. The Doctor,
however, still could not make out a transgression of the bye-laws,
and so he adds:</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Although
they may not actually transgress the bye-laws, still the minimum of
air space was closely approached in every case, and the rooms were
badly ventilated.</font></font></p>

We wonder whether the Potchefstroom Municipal bye-laws allow of bad
ventilation being tolerated. If so, why does not the Muni- cipality
ask for an amendment of the bye-laws, so that they might satisfy the
requirements of hygiene and sanitation? As a matter of fact, we
happen to know that the public health bye-laws framed by the
Government have been adopted by the Municipality of Potchefst- room,
and that they are stringent and exacting. The Doctor concludes the
medical portion of the report, by saying that, taken as a whole,
their manner of living is not up to the present-day standard, and
that houses and their residents in the centre of the town are a
continual source of danger to public health. We see nothing in the
report, which is so frankly contradictory, that would warrant the
opinion given by the Doctor. And, as if the medical report made by
him were not</p>

enough, he goes on to give a legal opinion, and suggests that the
Gov- ernment should be approached to compel all Asiatics other than
duly licensed traders to reside in the Bazaars.</p>

Although this report is in our opinion self-condemned, it might be
worth while producing an impartial opinion about the  very dwellings
on which Dr. Friel has given his verdict. We are, fortunately, in
possession of a report prepared at the instance of the Indians in
Potchefstroom by Dr. Thomas J. Dixon, the District Surgeon. He says:</p>

When we compare educated persons in India with those in other
countries, we are sadly disappointed. The formation of a new Liberal
Ministry in England is now under consideration. The ages of the
leaders of this group are very significant for us. Mr. Bryce and Mr.
John Morley are 67 years old, Lord Bracey and Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman are 69, Earl Spencer is 70, the Duke of Devonshire is 72
and Sir Henry Fowler, 75. Even Sir Charles Dilke, whose inclusion in
the Ministry is not very probable, is 60, and Lord Rosebery, 57. Some
at any rate of these gentlemen are bound to be in the new Ministry.</p>

Now, if we look round among Indians in any walk of life, we are
unlikely to come by many elderly persons who can boast of sound
health and vigour. One might attribute it to the Indian climate, but
this</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
can be valid only up to a point. Our men of earlier generations 
enjoyed long life, full of health and vigour. They were so tall and
well built that our contemporaries look dimunitive beside them. If
the Indian climate of old was so healthy and bracing, it cannot be
that it does not now favour a good physique. The real reason is that
we are unmindful of the maxims of good health. This attitude of
negligence, which begins at school or college, continues into
maturity. We remain engrossed in our work, in earning money and in
improving our lot. We then hardly stop to realise that it is only
natural for the body to wear down under severe strain. Most educated
Indians do not have the habit of regular physical exercise. They seem
quite innocent of the fact that the mind needs rest and recreation as
well. One might find stray clubs and societies [among Indians,] but
very few participate in their affairs actively. Some of them, who
have little to do at home, prefer low types of pleasure to a chat or
a game or two of billiards. Again, unlike Europeans who have an
intelligent appreciation of the importance of health and happiness,
they do not go to parties, balls, plays nor have they other pastimes.
Their lives are dull and mono- tonous, if we leave out of account the
variety of business that demands their attention. Such ways spell the
ruin of a whole people; but, unfor- tunately, no one can as yet
forsee their deleterious consequences. Not yet conscious of any
ill-health themselves free from disease. And because they can do
their work, digest their food and do not feel any manifest ailment,
they consider themselves healthy. All of a sudden, this sense of
well-being ceases; they find themselves in the grip of some serious
disease, and they despair. We must learn from the exam- ple of those
who have earlier fallen a prey to this habit, and beware. But then we
are too slow and careless to profit by such examples. That is why we
do not find among educated Indians persons of ripe old age. This
defect is by no means peculiar to any individual or family, rather
the entire Indian nation suffers from it. A countrywide effort is
most essential in order to save Indian youth from being blighted
prematurely.</p>

From the news received from the front, it appears that the battle now
being fought between Japan and Russia near Mukden bids fair to be
considered the greatest in all ancient or modern history. To call the
battle of Mukden, now in progress, the greatest may be dubbed an
exaggeration. It is natural that, as a result of the frequent
publication of sensational news in the papers, the people in general
develop a dislike for such reports and, consequently, calling the
battle of Muk- den the greatest might be considered an exaggeration.
Nevertheless, we must point out that tens of thousands of men are now
being annihilated on both sides in the battle. Japan has here
attacked Russia from east, west and south, that is, the attack is not
frontal, but on the flanks of the Russian army. If is possible that,
if the flanks succumb, the van also might give way.</p>

At the helm of all these manoeuvres of the army stands the heroic
figures of Marquis Oyama of Japan. The battle covers an area of a
hundred miles, and a million men have entered the field. The weapons
of destruction used range from the smallest rifles to the big- gest
guns. No effort possible for human talent has been spared to bring
about the quickest destruction of men. Courage and endurance have not
been found wanting under any test. A hundred thousand men have been
utterly destroyed. If Japan defeats Russia in this battle, there is
strong reason to believe that the end of the war is near at hand.
Having lost. Port Arthur,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 
</font></sup>Russia no more holds any sea power; and it is improbable
that she will send more men to Manchuria by land. The people in
Russia have already begun to detest the war; if, therefore, the army
at present in Manchuria sustains a defeat, it will not be necessary
for Japan to make any further sacrifices.</p>

ism was very largely addicted to idolatry. Several explanations were
offered in extenuation, but the lecturer could not deny the fact that
the Hindus seemingly worshipped stocks and stones. The Hindu phil-
osophers easily recognised and worshipped God as the purest spirit,
and Pantheism took them to the highest flight. It similarly brought
down the ignorant masses to the lowest depths. If the infant mind
could not realise God as a pure spirit, it had no difficulty in
worsh- ipping Him through His various manifestations. Many worship
Him through the sun, the moon and the stars, and many worship Him
through stocks and stones also, a mode of worship to which philo-
sophical Hinduism, with its tolerant spirit, had no difficulty in
recon- ciling itself. So the wheel of Hindu life went merrily on,
until there arose in the desert of Arabia a power that was destined
to revolutionise ideas and to leave a permanent impress. Mahomet,
whilst yet a boy, on seeing around him people given to idolatry, to
lustful indulgences, and to drunkenness, burned within himself with
rage. He saw also Judaism prostrate and Christianity debased. He
felt, even as did Moses and Christ, that he was a man with a mission.
He decided to deliver his mission to the world, and he chose the
members of his own family as the first recipients. The lecturer was
not one of these who believed that the religion of Islam was a
religion of the sword. Washington Irving, in his work on Islam, had
asked a pertinent question, namely,â Where had Islam, in its first
stage, found men to wield the sword?â He beli- eved that the
success of Mahomedanism was largely due to its simpli- city and to
its recognition of human weaknesses. He [the Prophet] taught that God
was One and only One, that he was His Messenger. He taught also that
prayer was absolutely necessary as an uplifting influ- ence, and in
order to bring together his followers, if only once in a year, he
instituted the pilgrimage to Mecca, for those  who  could  afford it,
and recognising that people would amass wealth, he enjoined upon his
followers that they set apart a certain portion of it religiously for
charitable purposes. The key-note of Islam was, however, its
levelling spirit. If offered equality to all that came within its
pale, in the manner that no other religion in the world did. When,
therefore, about 900 years after Christ, his followers descended upon
India, Hinduism stood dazed. It seemed to carry everything before it.
The doctrine of equality could not but appeal to the masses, who were</p>

caste-ridden. To this inherent strength was also added the power of
the sword. The fanatical raiders who, from time to time, found their
way into India, did not hesitate to convert by the sword if they
could not do so by persuasion. They more or less overran all parts of
India, breaking idols after idols, and although the Rajput valour was
at the disposal of Hinduism, it was powerless to afford protection
against the Mahomedan inroad. In keeping with the spirit of Hinduism,
an attempt was made at first to bring about reconciliation between
the two faiths, and in the city of Benares, there arose a holy man
about the 13th century, by name Kabir, who endeavoured, by keeping
intact the chief tenets of Hinduism and by borrowing somewhat from
Mahom- edanism, to bring about a fusion, but the attempt was not
quite suc- cessful. The Punjab, through which the Mahomedan
conquerors poured into India, and which bore the first brunt,
produced Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion who drew upon
Kabir of his doctrines and added to it militant Hinduism. He offered
the olive- branch by respecting the Moslem susceptibilities, but if
that were not accepted, he was equally ready to defend Hinduism from
the Moslem aggression, and thus Sikhism was a direct result of Islam.
It was well known how brave the Sikh was and what service he had
rendered to the British Government. The influence of Mahomedanism on
Hindu- ism was that it gave rise to Sikhism and it brought out one of
the chief characteristics of the religion, namely, toleration, in its
true light and fulness. When there were no political influences at
work, there was no difficulty about the Hindus and the Mahomedans
living side by side in perfect peace and amity, each respecting the
prejudices of the other, and each following his own faith without let
or hindrance. It was Hin- duism that gave Mahomedanism its Akbar,
who, with unerring insight, recognised the tolerant spirit and
adopted it himself in ruling India. Hinduism, moreover, showed its
elasticity in that, in spite of the fierce struggle, the classes as
well as large majority of the masses were left totally untouched, and
Hinduism arose out of the struggle braced, as we would rise out of a
cold bath, with warm glow. The first shock was, no doubt, severely
felt, but the Hindu religion soon asserted itself. The lecturer also
mentioned the Fakirs and the Yogis, and said that they lived almost
the same kind of life, although the former belonged to the Islamic
faith and the latter to the Hindu faith.</p>

My Association, therefore, respectfully ventures to submit that the
British Indian community at potchefstroom is entitled to a declar-
ation from the Government, disapproving of the manner in which the
anti-Asiatic agitation is being carried on a Potchefstroom and to an
assurance that their persons and property will be fully protected.
Probably the Government may be aware that the Potchefstroom Vigil-
ance Association, and such other bodies in the Colony, carry on the
agitation with a view, as they have stated, to strengthen the hands
of the Government, who, they say, are prepared to fall in with their
âDemandsâ and who are in their opinion at present engaged in
nego- tiations with the Home Government, having that end in view.</p>

		THE NATAL MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS BILL</h1>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.41cm; line-height: 95%">
We have before us the Natal <i>Government Gazette </i>of the 21st
February, 1905, containing a âBill to amend and consolidate the law
relating to the Municipal Corporationsâ. We give in another column
the clauses that bear directly or indirectly on the British Indian
question. This will be the second attempt of the Government to
introd- uce this Bill and pass it into law. The definitions given of
the terms âColoured personâ and âuncivilised racesâ are very
unsatisfactory, and are calculated to incorporate into the Bill the
mischief that has been already created by the definition of âColoured
personâ. Accor- ding to the Bill, the term includes, among others,
âany Hottentot, Coolie, Bushman or Lascarâ. Now the terms
âcoolieâ and âlascarâ themselves require difining, and it is
exceedingly dangerous to leave their interpretation to the
administrators of the measure, from the Attorney-General down to
Kaffir policemen. How, for instance, is a Kaffir policeman to know
who is a âcoolieâ and who a âlascarâ? Why, again, should the
term âcoolieâ be at all retained in the Bill, when it is well
known how offensive it has become?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 95%">
The definition of the term âuncivilised racesâ is an insult to
the Indians concerned, and more so to their descendants. An
infallible test of civilisation is that a man claiming to be
civilised should be an intel- ligent toiler, that he should
understand the dignity of labour, and that his work should be such as
to advance the interests of the community to which he belongs. Apply
this test to the lowest indentured Indian, and he will satisfy it.
Why, then, should he be called a member of an Indian labourer
uncivilised because he undertakes to serve the Colony under
indenture, why should the ban be placed upon his descendants? The
Higher Grade Indian School, about whose pupils the Governor and the
late Administrator have spoken in flattering and eloquent terms,
contains many children of Indians who have been under</p>

indenture. The children would do credit to any community. They are
intelligent and receive a liberal education. Is it right that they
should be labelled members of âuncivilised racesâ? The
distinction between such Indians and others would be based purely on
an accident, for we assure the framers of the Bill that there are
many identured Indians who are quite as good as some Indians who have
paid their own passa- ge and entered the Colony as free men. Indeed,
the indentured Indian deserves if anything, better treatment than the
free Indian, because the former has been invited and induced to come
to the Colony and has contributed not a little to its prosperity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.28cm; line-height: 95%">
Coming to clause 22 of the Bill, contrary to the declarations made by
the late Mr. Escombe and the late Sir John Robinson,-who, at the time
of introducing the political franchise Bill, commended it to the
Legislative Assembly on the ground that it left the municipal
franchise alone-we find the provisions of the Parliamentary Franchise
Act being applied to the municipal franchise, and if the Bill, as it
stands, become law; no person who is disqualified for the parliamen-
tary franchise by Act No. 8. of 1896, shall be eligible as a
municipal voter. That is to say, persons belonging to the races which
have not hitherto enjoyed representative institutions would be
disqualified from being voters at municipal elections, although they
may have enjoyed representative municipal institutions in their own
country. It is well known that India possesses elective
Municipalities in all the chief  cities, that there are hundreds of
such Municipalities and that there are thousands of Indian voters who
elect members to them. Why should they be disqualified? The framers
of the Bill have taken no note whatever of the great self-control
that the Indian community has exer- cised in connection with
municipal elections. They have refrained from having their names
placed on the burgess roll, and the clause in question is the one
offered to the community as a reward. We consider the clause to be a
deliberate insult, and we hope that the members of the Assembly will
not lend their support to the putting of such an affront upon the
Indian community.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
In clause 182, the Municipalities are to be given the power to frame
bye-laws regulating the use of pavements, foot-paths and ricks- haws
by Coloured persons. It is here that the interpretation of the terms
âcoolieâ an âlascarâ is necessary, and it is not difficult to
ima- gine what an engine of oppression the bye-laws are likely to be,
if the present definition is retained. This clause, evidently, is a
result of the agitation that is still going on in the Transvaal with
regard to the use of foot-paths by Coloured people, and of the
vacillating policy of the Government of that Crown Colony.</p>

Clause 200 makes provision for registration of persons belon- ging to
uncivilised races, resident and employed within the borough. One can
understand the necessity for registration of Kaffirs who will not
work; by why should registration be required for indentured Indians
who have become free, and for their descendants about whom the
general complaint is that they work too much? Is the son of an
indentured Indian, seeking employment as a clerk, to be registered?</p>

There are other objectionable clauses in the Bill, but we refrain,
for the present, from adverting to them in this brief notice of the
Bill. It is merely one of the many proofs of an attempt that is being
made all over South Africa to crush the Indian, because the whole of
the agitation that is at present going on, though nominally directed
agai- nst the Coloured man, is in reality directed against the
British Indian. The policy that is being followed is the policy that
was ascribed to the Boers by Lord Milner with reference to the
Uitlanders, in his famous Kimberley speech before the war. His
Lordship described it as a pin- prick policy; yet it will not be
doubted that the Uitlanders, in spite of the political disabilities
to which they were subject, were infinitely better off and better
able to put up with them than the Indians. If the treatment of the
Uitlanders be described as a policy of pin-prick, what shall we say
of the policy that is being followed in connection with British
Indians in South Africa? As a member of the Legislative Ass- embly of
Natal once said, the Colonial ideal should be to make the position of
the British Indians in South Africa as uncomfortable as possible, so
that their patience would be exhausted and they would leave the
country.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
What, now, is the duty of the British Indians under this trying
ordeal? The answer is simple. Patience is the badge of the Indians,
and they must not on any account forget that fact. It is a precious
heritage, and if they would only add to it a large fund of industry,
well-susta- ined and combined opposition to a usurpation of their
rights as subj- ects of the King-Emperor, they might still gain the
victory, even tho- ugh the odds may be against them. They must have
the faith of the undaunted prophet who, with the courage born of a
living confidence in his God, was wont to defy the hordes of the
enemy, and who, when reminded by his disciples that they were only
three against the enor- mous numbers of the latter, retorted that
they were not three but four, because the invisible presence of the
Almightly was with them.</p>

We are glad to see that the British Indians at the Cape have not
allowed the grass to grow under their feet with reference to the
Deal- ersâ Bill, which is to be introduced during the present
session of the Cape Parliament. An Indian deputation, headed by Sir
William Thorne and the Hon. Edmund Powell, has already waited on the
Hon. The Attorney-General. We must, however, confess to a feeling of
disap- pointment about the lame reply given by Mr. Sampson.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>It
is all very well for him to say that âa Resident Magistrate was not
bound to take into regard the question of keeping books in a European
language. The Bill said he might or might not.â We all know what
these discretionary powers mean. They have been abused before and
there is no guarantee that they will not be abused in future. We are
quite willing to accept the assurance that the Bill is ânot a  hit 
at  the  Indianâ, but so far as the latter is concerned, it would
amount to it, if it is capable of being so used. We make bold to say
that this is undoubtedly a Bill that will lend itself to a great deal
of persecution. Again, the Attorney-General totally missed the point
when he conten- ded it was a question of keeping books in a European
language. The Bill goes much further, and authorises a Licensing
Officer to refuse a licence on the ground of the applicantâs not
knowing a European language. We should have no objection to the books
being required to be kept in the English language, which could be
done by competent book-keepers, but it is a totally different
proposition to require the applicant to know some European language.
If the clause is meant to prevent fraud, we cannot understand why the
books should be kept in any other European languages than English.
Such an alteration, if confined to book-keeping and not extended to
the licence-holders, would take away from the clause the sting of
insult to the great Indian languages. The learned Attorney-General
then proceeds to read a lecture to the Indians, and says:</p>

Sunday trading law at the Cape? Could not illicit Sunday trading be
stopped with a heavy hand? And, if we may use the <i>tu </i><i>quoque
</i>argument, is illicit trading confined to Indians? Moreover, it is
painfully surpri-sing to see that the leader of the legal profession
at the Cape so far disregards the traditions if law as to bring in
support of his no bearing on it, for what possible connection can
there be between illicit Sunday trading and knowledge of a European
language on the part of an Indian trader? How would be prevent 
Sunday  trading by requiring of an applicant for a licence a
knowledge of a European language? The honourable gentleman proceeds:</p>

We have no hesitation in saying that, in making the statement, the
honourable gentleman was thinking of people other than Indians; for
we speak with knowledge when we say that there are very few Indians
whose wives assist at the sales. That the sons of the poorer
store-keepers may do so, we are not prepared to deny, but that would
be due more to jealousy regarding education of Indian children than
to anything else. It is hardly fair to place every obstacle in the
way of Indian education and then to say that the parents would not
educate their children. It this inequality, if such it be, to be
avoided by requ- iring knowledge of a European language by an Indian
store-keeper?</p>

It would have been far better, and more dignified, if Mr. Sam- pson
had effected a compromise and shewn some respect for Indian
sentiment. The principle of the Dealersâ Licenses Act is such as
would commend it to all right-thinking men under the present
circumstances of South Africa. The whole argument of the
Attorney-General, so far as it is applicable, goes to show that the
books of all store-keepers should be kept in English. If so, it
should be so stated in the clause. It would then disarm criticism,
and would considerably help the Law Department in enforcing the
provisions of the Bill, as they would then be accepted by a majority
of those whom it is likely to affect.</p>

The Incorporated Law Society at the Cape wishes to promote a Bill
whereby they intend to prevent any Coloured men being admitted to the
Cape Bar or the Side Bar. We are not aware of such legislation having
been undertaken in any of the British Dominions. The Cape has
hitherto enjoyed the distinction of being the most liberal among the
South African Colonies, and the freest from colour prejudice. That in
a Colony having such traditions there should be a body of men,
supposed to be the most intellectual portion of the community, who
wish to promote class legislation of the worst type is very
remarkable, for there appears to be absolutely no justification for a
step of that description. We wish to bring the proposed Bill to the
notice of the Inns of Court in London as also to the Incorporated Law
Society. We wonder what they will have to say in connection with this
most extra- ordinary proposal. It has been hitherto assumed that, to
a barrister passing out of one of the Inns of Court, the whole of the
British Dom- inions are open for practice. Is the Cape Colony, flying
the Union Jack, to set aside the rules framed by the Inns, and shut
out barristers from those Inns should they happen to wear a coloured
skin?</p>

A reactionary policy is being followed throughout South Africa
regarding the British Indians. I commend to your attention the cur-
rent numbers of <i>Indian Opinion </i>wherein you will find that at
the Cape they are trying to introduce a general Dealersâ Licenses
Bill which is calculated to do a great deal of harm to the British
Indians settled at the Cape. In Natal, as you will see, a Fire-arms
Bill has been published in the <i>Gazette </i>which needlessly 
insults  British  Indians. There is, too, a reproduction of the
Transvaal anti-Asiatic legislation in the district of Vryheid which
has been lately annexed to Natal and the Municipal Corporation Bill
contains clauses which are most objection- able. In the Orange River
Colony disabilities upon disabilities are being imposed upon Indians
through the instrumentality of bye-laws, and I venture to draw your
attention to the fact that, while a great deal has been done there
regarding the Transvaal legislation as also the Natal legislation, I
have not yet seen a question out in the House of Commons regarding
the Orange River Colony. I, therefore hope that this matter will also
be taken up. The current number of <i>Indian Opi</i>- <i>nion </i>deals
with the Natal Municipal Bill among other things and the next number
will deal with the other matters referred to in this letter.</p>

We have more than once drawn attention to the violently anti- Asiatic
policy of the Orange River Colony. In such policy, the late Boer
Government did not nearly approach the present Government, which, in
the name of the King-Emperor, is setting the seal of its app- roval
on the prevalent colour prejudice. We have waited in vain for the
fulfilment of Mr. Chamberlainâs promise that the anti-Asiatic laws
of the Orange River Colony would be remodelled in accordance with
British ideas. They are certainly being remodelled, but we have yet
to learn that the way in which they are being altered is consistent
with the traditions that have been always associated with the word
âBritishâ. The latest instance is to be found in the <i>Government
Gazette </i>of the Orange River Colony for the 10th inst. In the
regulations for the village of Odendaalsrust, which have received the
sanction of His Ex- cellency the Lieutenant-Governor and the
Executive Council, are contained some clauses regarding Natives with
reference to their living in Locations, the sale and manufacture of
Kaffir beer by them, the holding of dance parties in the Locations,
the keeping  of guests therein, the owning of dogs, etc., by them.
Now in the regulations, the term âNativeâ shall be interpreted
and taken to apply to and include  a man or men, as well as a woman
or women, above the age, or estima- ted age, of 16 years, of any
native tribe in South Africa, <i>and </i><i>also </i><i>all </i><i>Coloured
persons </i><i>and all </i><i>who, </i><i>in </i><i>accordance with
</i><i>law </i><i>or </i><i>custom, </i><i>are </i><i>called Coloured
persons </i><i>or </i><i>are </i><i>treated </i><i>as </i><i>such, </i><i>of
</i><i>what</i>[<i>ever</i>] <i>race </i><i>or </i><i>nationality
</i><i>they </i><i>may be</i>. In the clearest possible language,
therefore, the âMunicipalityâ of the village has been allowed to
include in the term âNativeâ the British Indians and other
Coloured people. If such a definition and such regulations were
passed in  the  Legislative Council of the Orange River Colony, they
would be subject to veto by the Home Government; but because a
village board passes them, and chooses to give an unwarranted
definition to the term âNativeâ, the Home Government is not to be
consulted, and the accommodating local Government has no hesitation
in countenancing wholesale restri- ctions of the character above
mentioned. Apparently, it  does not matter to that Government whether
such regulations offend the feel- ings of the Indian subjects of the
King-Emperor or not. We draw the attention of public men in England,
who cherish the proverbial sense of justice and fair play, to the
scandal revealed by the regulations in question which we reprint in
<i>extenso </i>in another column.</p>

In the <i>Government Gazette </i>of Natal for the 28th February, a
Bill is published regulating the use of fire-arms. Part 4 of the Bill
deals with the use of fire-arms by Natives Asiatics. We give all the
sections in another column. Evidently the framers of the Bill have
associated the Asiatics almost instinctively with the Natives, and it
is that attitude of mind against which we have always firmly and
respectfully protested. Since distinctions are made between one class
and another, justice will never be done to the Asiatic unless he is
treated as apart from the Natives. The Native question is a big
question in South Africa. The Native population is very large. The
Native civilisation is totally different from the Asiatic or the
European. The Native, being the son of the soil, has a right to fair
treatment, but being what he is, perhaps some legislation, which may
be of a restrictive character, in necessary. It can, therefore, never
apply to Asiatics. In this instance of the fire-arms, the Asiatic has
been most improperly bracketed with the Native. The British Indian
does not need any such restrictions as are imposed by the Bill on the
Native regarding the carrying of fire-arms. The predominant race can
remain so by preventing the Native from arming himself. Is there the
slightest vestige of justification for so preventing the British
Indian? It is a matter of common knowledge that the British Indian
who has settled in the Colony is not a military man. He is most
docile. Why should he, then, be insulted by being placed in the same
category with the Native? Would not a stranger, visiting Natal, and
coming across legislation of this kind, come to the conclusion that
the British Indians must be a very troublesome community? There are
occasions when British Indians, living in out- of-the-way places,
require to have a gun or a revolver. They are then, if the Bill
becomes law, to go not to the ordinary authorities, but to the
Secretary of Native Affairs, who has not connection with the British
Indians, and there beg for permission to own a revolver or a gun, as
if the Magistrates were incapable of using their discretion with
reference to the possession of fire-arms by British Indians. We do
not know that, in feeding anti-Indian prejudice in this wanton
manner, the Govern- ment are not unnecessarily exasperating the
British Indians. We hope that an amendment will be made in the Bill
when it comes up before the Natal Parliament.</p>

Some time elapses in merely thinking about a piece of work before it
is actually begun. Such time is known as stray moments. We carelessly
allow these bits time to pass. If we add up these stray mom- ents
which are thought to be of little account, they make no mean part of
our life; and not to make a proper use of them is to waste life
itself.</p>

Each one of us talks, more or less, about his education and imp-
rovement. We make plans of how best to use our spare time; but,
whenever we get a few stray minutes of leisure, we men and women-
particularly women-allow them thoughtlessly to pass away. We go on
cherishing dreams of the many things we would do, if and when we have
the time. The time we get is just a quarter or half hour or just a
few minutes. Then, we say to ourselves, âWell, it does not matter,
there isnât enough time nowâ. Thus we go on dreaming and the
golden opportunities slip away.</p>

What a fool we shall call the person who, needing Â£10, does not take
care of the few shillings he regularly gets! Nevertheless,  we 
behave just like him. We regret that we do not get time; and yet, we
idle away the stray minutes, which put together would make a whole
day, just as the stray shillings make a Bank-note.</p>

By making regular, daily use of such minutes, a young Euro- pean lady

When a man feels exhausted and is unable to carry on his work, the
best remedy is to lie down and sleep and, if possible, to remain in
bed for about a week. This is the best means to regain lost energy,
particularly mental energy, for during sleep the brain enjoys
complete rest, and the brain cells that are consumed during active
work are then restored through the supply of blood. Just as every
revolution of the wheel of an imposing streamer is the result of fuel
burning in the furnace of the boiler, so also every thought arising
in the brain is</p>

caused by the utilisation of its cells during the process of
thinking. The brain cells thus spent up can only be restored from the
life-giving substance in the blood, which is formed out of the food
we eat. The brain is so constituted that it can recover its used up
cells only in the quietude of rest or sleep. Intoxicating drinks or
drugs cannot give any nourishment to the brain. They only stimulate
it and force it to con- sume more of its cells; so much so that the
brain gets ultimately exh- austed, and has no strength left even to
take in the food needed by it, even as a man about to die of hunger
and thirst cannot swallow any food or drink.</p>

if you think that the Paper is deserving of support, I think it may
be possible to pay Â£10 towards it.</p>

Gandhiji said he had come to the conclusion that Theosophy was
Hinduism in theory, and that Hinduism was Theosophy in practice.</p>

There were many admirable works in Theosophical literature which one
might read with the greatest profit, but it appeared to him that too
much stress had been laid upon mental and intellectual studies, upon
argument, upon the development of occult powers, and that the central
idea of Theosophy, the brotherhood of mankind and the moral growth of
man, had been lost sight of in these. He did not wish to suggest that
such studies had no place in a manâs life, but he thought that they
should follow, not precede, the absolutely certain course which was
necessary for every life. There were certain maxims of life, which
they had not only to get an intellectual grasp of, but which they had
to weave into their very being, before they could at all follow the
great scriptures of the world.</p>

When a man desired to qualify in any science, he had first of all to
pass an entrance examination, but they seemed to think that when they
took up a religious book, no previous preparation in any other
direction was necessary, but that they could read these scriptures
untaught and interpret them for themselves; and that attitude of mind
was considered to be real independence of spirit. In his opinion it
was nothing but sheer licence taken with things of which they had not
the slightest knowledge. They were told in all the Hindu scriptures
that, before they could even handle these books, they must cultivate
absolutely pure and truthful lives, they must learn to control their
passions, which took them away from the central point.</p>

The mind had been likened to an intoxicated monkey, and so it was. If

He did not think it at all a part of their lives to extend their
scope, but thought it their duty to intensify it both with reference

make much better use of himself and of his opportunities than if he
divided his attention between this, that, and the next thing.</p>

Hindu sages told them that to live life, no matter how hampered it
might be, no matter with what limitations, was infinitely superior to
having a mental grasp of things divine. They had taught them that,
until, one by one and step by step, they had woven these things into
their lives, they would not be able to have a grasp of the whole of
the divine teaching; and so he urged them that, if they wanted to
live the real life, it was not to be lived in that hall, it was not
to be lived in Theosophical libraries, but it was to be lived in the
world around them, in the real practice of the little teaching that
they might have been able to grasp.</p>

There is an Act on the Statute-book of the Colony of Natal, No.28 of
1897 which is intended as a protection to Indian immi- grants who do
not come within the scope of the laws affecting inden- tured Indians.
When it was passed, the Indian community suggested that it was a law
which could be used as an engine of oppression. Its purpose was to
give those who would apply for it a certificate to the effect that
the holder was not an indentured Indian, so that he might not be
arrested on suspicion that he was under indenture and had left his
employer. It might well be that poor hawkers and such other Indians
would really, by taking out a certificate of this description, be
protected from molestation. But its effect has undoubtedly been to
cause a great deal of trouble and heart-burning; for although the Act
is simply permissive, it has been treated as if it were obligatory,
and many an Indian has been detained, and called upon to produce a
pass under that Act, or otherwise to show that he is not under
indenture.</p>

have entered the Colony in breach of the Immigration Restrictions
Act, from getting a pass from the Protector under the Act above
referred to, and thus defying the Immigration Act. But from reports
that we have received, the circular has caused a great deal of
mischief. It punishes a whole community in order that a few guilty
ones may be found out. It is also calculated to impose an unnecessary
fine of two shillings and six pence upon poor people. Those who need
a pass, under Act 28 of 1897, have first of all to arm themselves
with a certificate of domicile, for which a fee of 2/6 has to be
paid, and then, when such a certificate has been obtained, a shilling
has to be paid for a pass from the Protector.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now, as a matter of fact, such cumbersome formalities are totally
unnecessary. A pass, obtained under Act 28 of 1897, in no  way 
carried with it immunity from prosecution under the Immigration
Restrictions Act; and if a certificate of domicile be necessary, the
best thing to do is undoubtedly to repeal Act 28 of 1897, so that
those Indians who are in the Colony, and are entitled to remain in it
under the Immigration Restrictions Act, may take out a certificate of
domi- cile, should they be afraid of any molestation. To expect them
to go through the double procedure laid down by Mr. Bird is hardly
fair or just, and we question very much whether it is a proper thing,
by means of circulars such as the one to which we have drawn
attention, to interfere with the administration of law. There is
nothing in Act 28 of 1897 requiring production of a certificate of
domicile. We have no doubt that an Indian who insisted could, as a
matter of law, compel the granting of the pass by the Protector on
application. To require, then, the production of a certificate of
domicile is to make an unwarranted addition to the Act. We,
therefore, trust that either the circular in question will be
withdrawn, or that the Government will take an early opportunity of
repealing Act 28 of 1897.</p>

In the current number of <i>The Outlook</i>, the organ of the Johan-
nesburg Congregational Church, appears an article entitled âIn
Justice to the Indiansâ, an abstract of which appears in another
column. Our contemporary feels it time to protest against some
prevailing views affecting the Coloured sections of the community. It
confesses to a feeling of disgust at the sordid character of the
opposition to British Indians, and has read reports of anti-Asiatic
proceedings at various places âwith feelings of humiliation for
their unfairness of attitude and inaccuracy of statementâ. It
recongnises that some people really believe the presence of Asiatics
in South Africa to be detrimental to the public interest, and it
strikes the right note when it pleads for strict honestly when the
reason for objection is stated. It is not right to bring unfounded
charges against Indians when the objection is really based on colour
prejudice, or to find them to be a âdanger to the public healthâ,
when they are merely inconvenient competitors. The Indian fills his
own place in South Africa. The prosperity of Natal is very largely
dependent upon indentured labour, and, as <i>The Outlook </i>says, in
trades that he has made peculiarly his own, the Indian is indis-
pensable. His sobriety and respect for the law make him an excellent
citizen. We make bold to say that, could the people in this subcon-
tinent view the Asiatic question form outside, the attitude of the
Indian community under the most trying circumstances would provoke
only admiration. Their confidence in the British sense of Justice
remains unshaken, even in the face of harassing regulations such as
those to which we have recently drawn attention. Ultimately, Justice
will be done them. Indians have an ever increasing circle of friends
among the cultured Europeans of South Africa: some day their voice
will be heard. We thank our contemporary for this most timely
contribution; for, its evident sincerity, moderation and sanity will
commend it wher- ever <i>The Outlook </i>is read.</p>

time, queried the validity of Dr. Dixonâs report which we
published, showing that no such charge of insanitation could justly
be brought against the Indian community in Potchefstroom. We do not
quite know why facts are jeered at so frequently by our contemporary,
or why reputable statements are often misinterpreted or ignored. It
would appear that, it the King can do no wrong, the Indian can do no
right. No amount of proof that one can bring will convince those who
are obsessed by a contrary opinion, and, to us, it almost seems to be
flog- ging a dead horse to reply to such querulous comments as those
to which we draw attention. Our only reason for so doing is that
unpre- judiced readers may have food for reflection, and that they
may the more fairly judge of the rights and wrongs of the cause we
advocate. Dr. Dixon, at the beginning of October last, when the
anti-Indian feeling began to break its legitimate bounds, made his
examination at the request of the Indian community, he being
authorised to do so in his own time, at his own convenience, and in
any way that he thought fit. Therefore, there could be no possible
control over his actions on the part of the Indians concerned, nor
did the latter receive any  warning as to his visits. Moreover, the
District Surgeon made such enquiries, as is evidenced by the report
under review, as to disprove the allegation of overcrowding at night.
But the whole point of our argument seems to have been missed by the
<i>Budget</i>. We asserted that, notwithstanding the obvious
political animus underlying Dr. Frielâs report, even he was unable
to prove that the Indians had contravened the municipal regulations.
He said they were living in a manner which did not satisfy his own
standard. What that standard is no one knows but the Doctor himself.
And so far, the <i>Budget </i>has not replied to us. Meanwhile, we
understand that the Government has hinted pretty plainly that what
the Municipality would like to do is <i>ultra vires</i>.</p>

We congratulate our Indian brethren of the Cape on waking up betimes
and actively discharging their duty in regard to the new Bill. As
soon as the General Dealersâ Licences Bill was published in draft
form in the Cape <i>Government </i><i>Gazette</i>, the leaders sensed
its real purport. They held a big meeting in Cape Town<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, expressed their feel- ings about the Bill and passed
some resolutions, details of which have already been published
before<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. Alive to the gravity of the situation, they have not
remained content with just this. They waited in depu- tation upon the
Honourable the Attorney-General of the Cape Colony, presented these
resolutions and discussed them with him. In choosing the members of
the deputation, they showed tact, and included two respectable local
Members of Parliament<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>to lead them.</p>

The Attonery-General, Mr. Sampson, explained to them a number of
points about the draft Bill. Some of these explanations were all
right, but his answers, on the whole, cannot be said to have been
satisfactory. It is apparent that the Indian leaders will have to be
very much on their guard when the Bill comes up before Parliament.
The question of language, in particular, came in for much discussion
at this interview. An article in the Bill requires, of every
applicant for a licence, a knowledge of at least one European
language. On this point Mr. Sampson did some plain-speaking, but a
few other things he said showed that he was being shrewdly evasive.
The satisfying part of the interview was that he agreed to clarify,
in the provision relating to language, that only the account books
need be kept in a European</p>

language and that it was unnecessary [for the authorities] to ensure
whether or not the applicant knew the language. The Indians have no
objection to the books being required to be kept is a European
language; even so, the Attorney-General passed many strictures [on
Indian traders] with reference to this point. Although there was
little force in his arguments, Indians have to be cautious,
particularly about what he said on the subject of discretion being
vested in the Magis- trate. For any matter to be left to discretion
nowadays means uncer- tainly and endless delay. We have seen that,
all along, everywhere is South Africa, discretion has had only one
result, viz., it invairably goes against Indians. Mr. Sampson tried
to show that the Indians did not have much to fear but in doing so he
somewhat transgressed the limits of his own caution. Thus it was he
let the cat out of the bag when, in his final reply to Mr. Powell, he
said he had spoken vaguely in order to please. His reply sounds like
a joke. âIt is not at all necessary that the application to the
Magistrate should be in English,  though  it  should be intelligible
to him.â What does this mean?</p>

From Mr. Sampsonâs comments on the reasons  for  the proposed law,
it appears that he, too, is suspicious and not well  disposed towards
Indians. He does not appear to have taken the interview seriously;
and the illustrations he offered are in our opinion pointless. At one
point, he said that the Bill was not designed for Indians in
particular; and, at another, that such a law had  to  be enacted, as
the Chambers of Commerce and other mercantile bodies had been
bringing pressure [on the authorities], complaining that account
books of Indians were unsystematic, that he had, as a matter of
experience, found it the law courts to obtain the necessary
information form the books kept by Indians. The law he said, was
being enacted to protect European merchants, etc. Obviously, this
explanation appears to have been given without full consideration. He
then began to show that he was fair-minded and exhibit his knowledge
of Indians. While doing go, he referred to trading on Sundays and
asked if there were not instances of whole Indian families doing
business on Sundays. In this connection he mentioned a letter he had
received, which said that a certain entire Indian family, i.e.,
including the merchantâs wife and children, was doing business
illegally on Sundays. With such people the whites could not compete.
In this respect the Indians and the Greeks were equally blameworthy,
and all of them had to suffer for the sake of the few, etc. This drew

This, in brief, was what transpired at the interview. Now, the
question that occurs to us is: will a knowledge of English or some
other European language prevent these offences? We are much sur-
prised and grieved that the Attorney-General who is an able advocate
did not hesitate to argue as if it would. What relation can there be
between a manâs language and his character? Will the  complaints

Plague has wrought havoc in India. Its virulence this year has been
inordinate. The Government is helpless and the people despondent. In
the Punjab, the attack has been so fierce that trade has suffered
heavily. And even those with a high standard of living who were less
susceptible to its attack are no longer so. Nevertheless, the dread
epidemic is found spreading only among the indigenous popu- lation.
Many people think that this plague is the visitation of Godâs wrath
on us for our accumulated sins. A correspondent of <i>The Times of
India </i>has accordingly made a suggestion to the Government that
they should fix a day when all India might offer prayers to God to
eradicate the epidemic.</p>

<i>April 7, 1905 </i>That your petitioners hereby venture to approach
this Hon- ourable House in connexion with certain two Bills that will
be brought</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; line-height: 95%">

Your petitioners venture to think that the definition of the
expression âColoured personâ in the first Bill above mentioned is
very unsatisfactory, in that it means, among others, âany coolie or
lascarâ, which themselves require a definition; for, it will be
very difficult for a police constable to know whom he is to consider
a âcoolieâ or a âlascarâ, as the terms do not denote a
particular race, but are applied to mean unskilled labourers and
seamen respectively.</p>

In the humble opinion of your petitioners, the definition of the term
âuncivilised racesâ is also unsatisfactory, and the term itself
is offensive to those whom it is intended to include. Moreover, your
Petitioners fail to understand why the children of indentured Indians
should be classed among âuncivilised racesâ. Many of them have,
by industry, risen very high in education and culture, and occupy
impor- tant positions in the Colony, either as employees or
independent men.</p>

By sub-clause (c) in clause 22, persons who are disqualified for the

Your Petitioners have failed to see any justification for authority
to the Town Councils in the Colony to make by-laws with respect to
the use of pavements and foot-paths by âColoured personsâ, and
also the use of rickshaws by them, in so far as the term includes
Indians. It is thus in this connexion that the definition of the term
âColoured personâ comes into play, and is calculated to give rise
to a great deal of mischief.</p>

Your Petitioners also humbly protest against clause 200 of the said
Bill, in that it authorises the Council to frame by-laws establishing
a system of registration of Natives or persons belonging to âuncivi-
lised racesâ. In your petitionersâ opinion, registration of those
In- dians who are included in the term âuncivilised racesâ is
totally uncalled for, as Indians have never been found unwilling
workers. It will furthermore appear, from the clause under
discussion, that regis- tration would be required of even cultured
Indians.</p>

With regard to the second Bill, your Petitioners venture to submit
that it has very much grieved the British Indians residing in the
Colony. Sections 44 to 47 deal with the use of fire-arms by Natives
and Asiatics. Your Petitioners think that the Indians with the
Natives is hardly justified. The Indian is a very docile Colonist,
and has never given any trouble, and your Petitioners venture
respectfully to point out that to bracket Indians and Natives
together, and to compel the former to deal with the Native Department
before they can obtain a permit to own a fire-arm, which may be
required for self-protection, would be extremely degrading.</p>

From a cablegram in the local papers, we notice that Mr. Lyt- telton,
in reply to a question, has stated that the position of the British
Indians in the Transvaal has been bettered by the judgement<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>in  the Test Case of <i>Motan </i>v. <i>The
Government</i>. With all due respect, we venture to think that the
statement is not in accord with facts; and in any case, why should he
or the Government take the slightest credit for any relief in the
position because it was obtained in spite of the Government? Is it
not a fact that the Government opposed the appli- cation for a
licence made to the Supreme Court? They were repres- ented by three
eminent counsel, and they really drove the Indian com- munity to the
test case, because it was undertaken after even the old <i>bona-fide
</i>traders were refused licences to trade, on the ground that they
did not hold licences immediately before the outbreak of hosti-
lities. That they traded outside Locations before the war was not
held sufficient.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.25cm; line-height: 95%">
We are, indeed, strongly reminded of the pre-war days. Then, too,
there was a test case<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 
</font></sup>exactly similar to the one referred to by Mr. Lyttelton.
Then, the British Government assisted the Indians to fight the case.
They contended, with the Indians, that under Law 3 of 1885, Indian
trade outside Locations was not prohibited, but after the Transvaal
passed into British hands, a different tune was played. The same
British Government, in the test case of Motan, instructed Counsel to
oppose the Indian contention. It is strange that, having this know-
ledge, Mr. Lyttelton should appropriate credit for the decision of
the Supreme Court on the test case. But, as we have said, the
position of the Indians has not in any way become better than it was
during the Boer regime. It has certainly become better that it was
before the test case, but after the establishment of British
Government in the Trans- vaal, the decision of the Supreme Court
enables the Indians, <i>on </i><i>pay- </i><i>ment </i><i>of </i><i>licence
money</i>, to trade where they like. Before the war, under the
protection of the British Government, the Indians were able to trade
where they liked <i>without payment </i><i>of </i><i>any </i><i>licence

true that the Indians tendered the licence money, but the Boer Gove-
rnment declined to accept it, and were powerless, owing to British
opposition, to prosecute the Indians who, with their knowledge and
under notice to them, traded outside Locations. Thus, the position of
the British Indians, so far as regards trade, was better before the
war than it is to-day. In other respects, too, the position is bad
enough, and certainly no less gloomy than before the war, and it is
unexcusably painful, so far as Indian immigration into the country is

Transvaal, and that he has paid, before the war, the sum of Â£3 as
the price of permission to settle in the Colony, finds it
tremendously difficult to obtain a permit to enter the country; and a
British Indian, no matter what his qualifications or status may be,
if he be not a refugee, cannot possibly enter the coun- try. His
application receives scant treatment at the hands of the Gover-
nment; and this all but total prohibition of Indian immigration has
been brought about, not by fair and open means, but by pressing into
service a political ordinance passed, in the first instance, to
prevent the entry into the Transvaal of people who might be suspected
of having treasonable designs. That Ordinance is being now abused to
shut the Indian out of the country. The religious susceptibilities of
the Indians were hardly ever touched during the old regime, but now,
though it is true that one cannot say anything against the Government
on this point, the fact stands that there is an agitation to-day
going on in Potchefstroom against the erection of a mosque, not, as
has been  stated in a prominent place in the town, but in a by-lane.
We could go on recounting the troubles of the Indians, and could show
how, contrary to all expectations that were raised in the  minds of
the Indians by the conduct of the British Government,  and  by  the
speeches of British Ministers, the Indians now find themselves face
to face with a life-and-death struggle, and for Mr. Lyttelton to say
that the position of the British Indians in the Transvaal has been
bettered is, to say the least, extremely misleading. Not until the
Law 3 of 1885, and other laws dealing with the British Indians, have
been erased from the Statute-book of the Transvaal Colony, and
legislation passed in greater agreement with British ideas of
justice, will it be possible for the British Indian in the Transvaal
to say that he is once more a British subject, enjoying all the
rights that flow from such a status. To-day he is a step-child
seeking and yearning for protection on the part of his parents, which
protection he does not get.</p>

It is well known that Indians cannot hold land in their own names and
that some of them, therefore, purchase land in the names of the
whites. Mr. Syed Ismail, a resident of Johannesburg, possessed some
land which he held in the name of a white friend of his, Mr. Lucas.
When the Johannesburg Corporation acquired Locations, etc., this land
also was taken over by them, and a resolution to pay Mr. Lucas Â£2,000
as compensation was passed. Mr. Lucas died during the war, and his
estate was attached for insolvency. As his assets were not sufficient
to pay off his debtors, in trustees claimed the  compen- sation
payable towards the land held by him on behalf of Syed Ismail. Syed
Ismail thereupon filed a suit in the High Court claiming that this
sum of Â£ 2,000 should be paid to him. The creditors of Lucas raised
two issues: firstly that the amount claimed by Syed Ismail stood in
the name of Lucas, and secondly, that, since the land to which Syed
Ismail claimed a title was immovable property, he could not enjoy the
right of its ownership. The rejoinder to this, submitted on behalf of
Syed Ismail, was that, as the land was held on ninety-nine yearsâ
lease, it could not be regarded as immovable property and that,
therefore, there could be no objection to Indians owning such land.
And should the Court not hold this argument valid, there was the
alternative answer that the law, which prevented Indians from
ownership of immovable property, did not lay down that immovable
property could not be held by others, such as the whites, in their
own names on behalf of Indians. Giving the verdict in favour of Syed
Ismail, the honourable judge remarked, with regard to the second
issue, that land on a ninety nine yearsâ  lease  should<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>be
 considered  immovable  property,  and  such land, therefore, could
not stand in the name of an Indian. Granting Syed Ismailâs second
plea, however, the judge held that the whites could hold lands for
the benefit of Indians, and that the law would protect the rights of
an Indian owner if a white holding the propety intended to commit
fraud. This decision is very satisfactory; therefore, the Indians who
are hesitating to purchase land in the names of whites need have no
such fear any longer. It should, however, be borne in mind that the
white concerned must be a turstworthy person and a clear title-deed
should be obtained from him. It appears certain that</p>

A Reuter cable tells us that Lord Curzon made a forceful speech in
the Indian Legislature in support of our case. He said that the South
African Colonies would get no help from India, so long as they did
not guarantee that the rights of Indians would be fully safeguarded.
He added that it was the duty of the Government of India to protect
the Indians and that they would continue to discharge that duty.</p>

These words are bound to gladden us. They will certainly have a good
effect. The speech shows that our efforts here do not go in vain. It
behoves us to continue to make added effort and, as opportu- nity
presents itself, agitate for the redress of our grievances. We are
sure that, given unity and concerted effort, we shall succeed.</p>

unsatis- factory in every respect. Here is a charge of extreme
gravity made with the fullest deliberation before an audience of
cultured men, who enjoyed a most responsible position in the Colony.
Mr. Barnett was then speaking generally on education in Natal, and
the above charge is by no means an isolated passage in his address,
which is a serious indictment against the system of education
prevalent in Natal. To call for a report from the Protector of
Immigrants in a matter of this kind is very much like setting a man
to judge his own case. Mr. Barnettâs charge, we contend, includes
in its condemnation the whole of the Indian Immigration Department.
We do not say he is right, but we do say that the report drawn [up]
by a Department which is condemned contradicting the condemnation is
hardly the way to meet the indictment.</p>

think that the Government would be extremely ill-advised in not
probing the question to the bottom, and giving the fullest
satisfaction to the public. If the result of the independent inquiry
in any way supports Mr. Barnettâs charge, the sooner the blot is
removed the better for the Colony; and if the charge is proved to be
incorrect, Mr. Barnett sho- uld be called upon, as a past public
servant, to offer an explanation. We hope, therefore, that Mr.
Ancketill will continue to question the Colonial Secretary until what
is needful has been done.</p>

It is to be noticed, also, that Mr. Barnett delivered his attack
before an audience that included the ex-Prime Minister of Natal, Sir
Albert Hime, and many other Natal notabilities. Sir Albert Hime made
lengthy remarks after the lecturer had finished, and we do not see
anywhere a repudiation of the serious charge brought by Mr. Barnett.
Does the Colonial Secretary not find food for reflection here?</p>

When the Theosophical Society invited me to deliver these spe- eches,
I accepted the invitation on two considerations. It is now nearly
twelve years that I have been living in South Africa. Everyone is
aware of the hardships suffered by my compatriots in this land.
People view with contempt the colour of their skin. I believe all
this is due to a lack of proper understanding; and I have continued
to stay in South Africa with a view to helping as much as possible in
the removal of this misunderstanding. I, therefore, felt that it
would to some extent help me in the fulfilment of my duty if I
accepted the Societyâs invitation; and I shall regard myself very
fortunate if I am able, through these lectures, to give you a better
understanding of the Indians. I am to speak to you no doubt about the
[Hindus<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>]; but the ways and manners of the Hindus and other
Indians are all but identical. All Indians have similar virtues and
vices and are descended from the same stock. The other consideration
was that there was, among the objects of the Teo- sophical Society,
this one, viz., to compare the various religions, find out the truth
underlying these and show the people how those reli- gions were only
so many roads leading to the realisation of God, and how one ought to
hesitate to dub any of them false. I thought that this object, too,
would be realised to some extent if I said a few words on the Hindu
religion.</p>

Hindus are not considered to be the  original  inhabitants  of India.
According to Western scholars, the Hindus as well as most of the
European peoples lived at one time in Central Asia. Migrating from
there, some went to Europe, some to Iran, others moved south-
eastwards down into India through the Punjab, and there spread the
Aryan religion. The Hindu population in India exceeds two hundred
millions. They are called Hindus because they once lived beyond the
river Sindhu (Indus). The Vedas are their oldest scripture.  Very 
devout Hindus believe that the Vedas are of divine origin and without
beginning. Western scholars hold that these were composed before 2000
B.C. The famous Mr. Tilak of Poona has shown that the Vedas must be
at least 10,000 years old.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

The Hindu religion underwent its first trial on the advent of Lord
Buddha. The Buddha was himself the son of a [king<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>]. He is said to have been born before 600 B.C. At that
time the Hindus were under the glamour of the outward form of their
religion, and the Bra-hmins had, out of selfishness, abandoned their
true function of defen-ding the Hindu faith. Lord Buddha was moved to
pity when he saw his religion reduced to such a plight. He renounced
the world and started doing penance. He spent several years in devout
contemplation and ultimately suggested some reform in the Hindu
religion. His piety greatly affected the minds of the Brahmins, and
the killing of animals for sacrifice was stopped to a great extent.
It cannot, therefore, be said that the Buddha founded a new or
different religion. But those who came after him gave his teachings
the identity of a separate religion. King Ashoka the Great sent
missionaries to different lands for the propagation of Buddhism, and
spread that religion in Ceylon, China, Burma and other countries. A
distinctive beauty of Hinduism was rev- ealed during this process: no
one was converted to Buddhism by  force. Peopleâs minds were sought
to be influenced only by discus- sion and argument and mainly by the
very pure conduct of the prea- chers themselves. It may be said that,
in India at any rate, Hinduism and Buddhism were but one, and that
even today the fundamental pri- nciples of both are identical.</p>

We have seen that Buddhism had a salutary effect on Hinduism, that
the champions of the latter were aroused by its impact. A thou- sand
years ago, the Hindu religion came under another  influence more
profound. Hazrat Mahomed was born 1300 years ago. He saw moral
anarchy rampant in Arabia. Judaism was struggling for survival;
Christianity was not able to gain a foothold in the land; and the
people were given to licence and self-indulgence. Mahomed felt all
this to be improper. It caused him mental agony; and in the name of
God, he determined to make them realise their miserable condition.
His feeling was so intense that he was able immediately to impress
the people around him with his fervour, and Islam spread very
rapidly. Zeal or passion, then, is a great speciality, a mighty
force, of Islam. It has been the cause of many good deeds, and
sometimes of bad ones too. A thousand years ago the army of Ghazni
invaded India in order to</p>

spread Islam. Hindu idols were broken and the invasions advanced as
far as Somnath. While, on the one hand, violence was thus being used,
the Muslim saints were, on the other, unfolding the real merit of
Islam. The Islamic principle that all those who embraced Islam were
equals made such a favourable impression on the lower classes that
hundreds of thousands of Hindus accepted that faith, and there was
great commotion in the whole community.</p>

</font></sup>was born in Benares. He thought that, according to Hindu
philosophy, there could be no distinction betwen a Hindu and a
Muslim. Both of them, if they did good works, would find a place in
heaven. Idolatry was not an essential part of Hinduism. Reasoning
thus, he attempted to bring about a synthesis between Hinduism and
Islam; but it did not have much effect, and his became no more than a
distinct sect, and it exists even to-day. Some years later, Guru
Nanak was born in the Punjab; he accepted the reasoning of Kabir and
made a similar attempt to fuse the two religions. But while doing so,
he felt that Hinduism should be defended against Islam, if necessary
with the sword. This gave rise to Sikhism, and produced the Sikh
warriors. The result of all this is that, despite the prevalence of
Hinduism and Islam as the two principal religions of India to-day,
both the communities live together in peace and amity and are
considerate enough not to hurt one anotherâs feelings save for the
bitterness caused by political machinations and excitement. There is
very little difference between a Hindu <i>yogi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

While Islam and Hinduism were thus vying with each other, the
Christians landed at the port of Goa about 500 years ago, and set
about converting Hindus to Christianity. They also partly resorted to
force and [converted] partly through persuasion. Some of their
ministers were exceedingly tender-hearted and kind, rather one would
call them saintly. Like the <i>fakirs </i>they made a deep impression
on the lower classes of Hindu society. But later, when Christianity
and Wes- tern civilisation came to be associated, the Hindus began to
look upon the religion with disfavour. And today, we see few Hindus
embracing Christianity inspite of the fact that the Christians are
ruling over a vast kingdom. Nevertheless, Christianity has had a very
considerable influ- ence on Hinduism. Christian priests imparted

Thus, we have seen how there have been three assaults on Hinduism,
coming from Buddhism, Islam and then Christianity, but how on the
whole it came out of them unscathed. It has tried to imb- ibe
whatever was good in each of these religions. We should, however,
know what the followers of this religion, Hinduism, believe. This is
what they believe: God exists. He is without beginning, immaculate,
and without any attribute or form. He is omnipresent and omnip-
otent. His original form is <i>Brahman</i>. It neither does, nor
causes to be done. It does not govern. It is bliss incarnate, and by
it all this is susta- ined. The soul exists, and is distinct from the
body. It also is without a beginning, without birth. Between its
original form and the <i>Brahman</i>, there is no distinction. But it
takes on, from time to time, a body as a result of <i>karm</i><i>a</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">7
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>or
the power of <i>maya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">8</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, and goes on being born again and again into high or
low species in accordance with the good or bad deeds performed by it.
To be free from the cycle of birth and death and be merged in <i>Brahman
</i>is <i>moksha </i>or liberation. The way to achieve this <i>moksha
</i>is to do pure and good deeds; to have compas- sion for all living
beings, and to live in truth. Even after reaching this stage, one
does not attain liberation, for one has to enjoy embodied</p>

Action should be undertaken for its own sake, without an eye on the
fruit. In short, everything should be dedicated to God. We should not

anything. We should look upon all equally. These are the beliefs or

crossed your letter, under reply, would show you that I would even
decrease the Hindi columns if you have not enough support. The same
thing applies to Tamil. There is no prospect of my being able to go
there at present. I have already send Â£ 100. You should not sign the
notes in favour of M. C. Camroodeen three months hence. We should get
at least six months. You need not bother about Mr. Nazar giving you
any Gujarati. Can you definitely come in the beginning of May? If you
fix your date beforehand, I can arrange for your permit. If Appoo
wants you to send two copies, do so by all means, charging for one
only, and you should regularly send three copies to Mr. Rus- tomji at
Bombay. Can you not reduce the complimentary list for India and
London? What is the total of foreign complimentary copies, that is
outside British South Africa? I am studying Tamil very diligently
and, if all is well, I may be able to fairly understand the Tamil
articles within two months at the outside. I am rather anxious to get
the Tamil books. Please therefore try if you cannot get them. You
Understand, I suppose, what I want? You may go over to Mr. Mood-leyâs

the brink of bankruptcy that Indian immigration was thought of. Sir
James Hullett, only a few months ago, giving his evidence before the
Native Affairs Commission, said emphatically that Natal owed its pro-
sperity to the presence of the Indian immigrant, and that it could
not do without him. The greatest proof, however, in support of the
state- ment that Natal requires the Indian is given by Mr. Hills
himself. If the Indian population in Natal has doubled since 1896,
what is the cause? It is simply that more and more Indians are being
required in order to keep going the chief industries of Natal,
namely, sugar, tea and coal. It should be remembered that the Indian
of whom Mr. Hills is thinking is not an intruder, but that he is
actually invited to the Colony for its benefit. There are still
18,000 applications before the Indian Immigration Trust Board which
have to be dealt with. The demand for indentured Indian labour is
much greater than the supply. Verulam always had a large Indian
population. Mr. Hills, in regretting that it has become an Indian
township, forgets that it had either to become an Indian township or
cease to be a town at all. The north coast of Natal takes in the
largest Indian population. It has to be dev- eloped either by Indian
labour or not at all. The Natalians have thou- ght better, and have
not hesitated to cultivate the coast land through Indian labour, and
the palatial mansions which the white men occupy even on the north
coast, let it be remembered, are due entirely to the assistance of
the Indian immigrant, and are owned by the employers of Indian
labour, so that the example of Natal is all in favour of the Indian,
and the âeconomic considerationsâ on which Mr. Hills lays so much
stress have compelled the Natalians to resort to Indian assis- tance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Again, Mr. Hills makes a mistake when he states that âthe law,
under the late Government as interpreted for 15 years, confined Asia-
tics to Locationsâ. It is a well-known fact that, under the late
Govern- ment, the Indians lived outside Locations with absolute
impunity, and, it is because they were able to do so, that the
present Government find it difficult to oust them. It is true that,
as they had British protection then, it could hardly be withdrawn
now, and it should be again rem- embered that, during the Boer
regime, there was no restriction against Indian immigration, whereas,
today, as the Chief Secretary for Permits has shown, only those
Indians who were settled in the country before the war are allowed to
re-enter, and then, too, after much questioning and delay. Although
Mr. Hills talks about the white population in general and its good,
in applying his principles, he only takes notice of the Indian
licences to trade. Is it, then, that he objects only to the Indian
traders? Mr. Hills again makes the mistake of supposing that</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the South African Coloured people are refused licences, whilst the
Indians received them freely. Under the Supreme Courtâs ruling, the
Government dare not prevent any Coloured people, as such, from
getting licences, and if Mr. Hillsâ objection is, after all, as it
evidently seems to be, against the trade of the Colony falling
entirely or even largely into the hands of Indians, there is not much
difficulty in sympathising with him, nor has the Editor of <i>The
</i><i>Outlook </i>suggested that such competition should not be
regulated by a statute of general application. But to thus regulate
Indian trade, and to hound the Indian out of the Colony by all kinds
of vexatious legislation, are two dif- ferent things. With the one,
every sensible Colonist will be in perfect agreement, so long as
vested interests are not touched, and licences are not refused to
Indians as such. But it is scarcely in keeping with justice and fair
play, for instance, to prevent the Indian from walking on foot-paths,
from owning landed property, from living, subject to strict municipal
regulations, or from building a mosque, anywhere he likes. Such
restrictions are meaningless, if they do not proceed from colour
prejudice, and it is questionable whether those who fan the flame of
such prejudice would be doing any good to posterity. The facts must
be taken as they are. India is part of the British Empire, like the
Trans- vaal, and there ought to be a policy of give and take, whilst
there certainly should be nothing done to needlessly wound the
feelings of these men, who are, after all, subjects of the same King,
and are a people with remarkable traditions and a wonderful ancient
civilisation.</p>

Two simple bills are likely to solve the whole difficulty. One would
give to the Local bodies control of all trade licences, subject, in
exceptional cases, to review by the Supreme Court, and the other
would regulate immigration into the Colony after the manner of the
Cape Immigration Act.</p>

One more statement by Mr. Hills needs correction. After the
correspondence that appeared in <i>The Star</i>, challenging the
statement that there are 49 Indian, as against 13 white,
store-keepers in Pieters- burg, some caution, at least, is necessary.
The British Indian Associa- tion has stated<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>definitely that there are only 23 Indian stores in
that town. Mr. Kleinenberg, whom Mr. Hills has copied, has not been
able to refute that statement. It is, therefore, necessary for Mr.
Hills to ascertain from Mr. Kleinenberg whether the figures he gave

Association has had the</p>

Elsewhere will be found the letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup>of the energetic British Indian Association of
Johannesburg, addressed to the Colonial Secre-tary of the Orange
River Colony on its anti-Asiatic activity. We must congratulate the
Association on having made a move in this scanda- lous matter.
Hitherto we have had to draw attention to the township regulations.
Emboldened by the impunity with which these regulat- ions have passed
muster, the Municipality of Bloemfontein has now secured as Ordinance
giving it almost the same powers that have been arrogated by several
townships of the Orange River Colony through the regulations to which
attention has been drawn from time to time in this journal. The
passing of this Ordinance shows that the anti-Asiatic clauses thereof
have met with the approval of the Imperial Colonial Secretary. As the
Chairman of the British Indian Association states in his letter,
there is no doubt that such legislation is âdegrading, unjust and
insultingâ and that âsuch anti-Coloured activity in the Orange
River Colony is contrary to British traditions, as also to the
declara- tions made from time to time by Her late Majestyâs
Ministersâ.</p>

We notice that Sir Mancherjee<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>has been again questioning Mr. Lyttelton on Indian
matters in South Africa. We venture to think that, to his many
services to the British Indians in South Africa, he will add yet
another measure, if he will earnestly take up the question in the
Orange River Colony, though it does not actively interfere with the
British Indians at present. We do not despair of a time when a fair
proportion of Indians will be allowed to settle in that Colony; and
for that matter, even in the present day, there are probably no fewer
than 200 Indians earning their livelihood in one or other of the
towns in the Orange River Colony. We feel that even they, handful as
they are, require protection from the studied degradation to which
they are subjected by the laws of the State.</p>

ask whether it is politic or right that the natives of the soil
should be harassed by unnecessary restrictions. Under British rule,
no commu- nity is allowed to remain stagnant and unprogressive. The
Natives are being gradually educated. It would be a mistake to
suppose that they have no feelings or that they do not smart under a
curtailment of their natural liberty. We are not exaggerating when we
compare regulations of the control of Locations in the Orange River
Colony with those for the control of prisoners in a well-ordered
jail. If the inmates of the Orange River Colony Locations have a
little greater liberty, it is only a question of degree but not of
kind. The monster petition from the Na- tives in the Transvaal shews
that they are awakening to a sense of their rights under the British
flag. True statesmanship would consist in anti- cipating and
providing for their reasonable wants. In the Orange River Colony, the
Native is evidently not credited with having any feeling.</p>

We have received a letter from Ceylon requesting us to arrange a
meeting for the promotion of a memorial to the Registrar of Lon-don
University, praying that Tamil may be accepted as an optional
language in the curriculum of that University for the matriculation
and other examinations in arts. We invite the attention of the Tamil-
educated Indians to the matter which, in our opinion, deserves every
encouragement. There should be no difficulty about their holding a
meeting and adopting a simple memorial to the External Registrar of
the University of London. Tamil immigrants in other parts of the
world have already sent in their representations, and we do not see
why the same thing should not be done by those in South Africa. Tamil
is one of the greatest of the Dravidian languages and has a vast
literature. It is supposed to be the Italian of India, and is in
every way a language fit to be adopted by London University as an
optional subject. London University is recognised to be the most
liberal insti- tution in the world, and seeing that Tamil is spoken
by millions of the subjects of the King-Emperor, the University of
the Metropolis of the Empire will do well to grant the prayer of the
Tamil memorialists.</p>

M. M. Bhownaggreeâs question as to the treatment of Indians on the
mines. The reply is unsatisfactory in the extreme. Mr. Leyttelton
said he was not aware that anything warranted such an inquiry: but
when he receives the reports of the latest cases, he may alter his
opinion. The fact of these unsavoury cases continually cropping up is
quite sufficient warrant for a rigid and impartial enquiry. Mr.
Lyttelton added that there was a Protector of Indians in Natal,
thereby sugges- ting that he was the person to move in the matter.
But we have not heard that he has done so. Commenting on Mr.
Lytteltonâs reply, which it regards as unsatisfactory, <i>The Natal
Witness </i>reiterates the demand for an enquiry. With regard to the
Protector of Indians, the <i>Witness </i>says:</p>

our Government fails to recognise its duty in these matters, it is to
be hoped the question will not be lost sight of at home, and that

We hope these cases will be brought to the notice of the Government
of India, who, from past experience, will not be so easily satisfied
as Mr. Lyttelton. But the best thing of all would be for the Natal

contem-porary suggests, and probe the matter to the bottom without

Malaria has been raging in Durban with great virulence. There were
only 12 cases in last January, but the number of persons attacked

The incidence of malaria is greater among the whites than among the
Coloured people. Of the 612 cases mentioned above, 400 were whites,
185 Asiatics and 27 Kaffirs. This shows that some comm- unities are
more susceptible to certain diseases than others. While the Indians
are more liable to plague, the whites are particularly suscep- tible
to malaria. But if we consider the matter in this fashion, it would
be just like the pot calling the kettle black. Nevertheless, malaria
is not a deadly disease, while plague is a terrible killer. Through
proper investigation, the causes of both these diseases can be found
out. We must not fail in our duty to take all the necessary
precautions.</p>

from the Town Council for doing so. It is the duty of the Town Clerk
to issue passes to all those who ask for them. The Indians in general
refused to take out passes in this way. They carried on a fight for
about a year and a half and managed to carry on without the passes.
But when the Town Council took legal proceedings against them, the
Magistrate decided in its favour. The Indians preferred an appeal
against the decision on the plea that they were not âAsiaticsâ
but Aryans who had subsequently settled in India. We are constrained
to say that our brethren have wasted their money on the litigation,
and brought ridicule on themselves to boot. It is all very well to

We ought to have woken up when the East London law was enacted. It is
very difficult to get a law repealed once it has been passed. Our
advice now is that we should submit quietly to the law and take out
passes. Compared with other places like the Transvaal, the situation
in East London is still tolerable. While complying with the law, we
should, of course, continue the fight. But the struggle should be
carried on through Parliament. Our people in East London have the
power and the right to vote. It would yield good results if we
excercised them judiciously.</p>

The Government has already collected Â£ 28,290 from these people.
This is by no means a negligible sum when one comes to think of it.
It is a matter of great sorrow that such penalty is inflicted on
British subjects; but where there is no remedy, one has to reconcile
oneself to the situation. According to Lord Curzon, the average <i>per

The poet here tells us that the main reason for the rise of Eng- lish
is their sturdy physique. The Japanese have shown that not much
depends upon the phyisque of a man. The fact that the Russians,
though well set up and tall, have proved powerless before the short
and thin Japanese, has put the English officials in a quandary. They
gave thought to the matter and discovered that Europe was very much
behindhand in physical culture and knowledge of the laws governing
the body. The Japanese understand very well how the various joints
and bones of the (opponentâs) body can be controlled, and this has
made them invincible. Many of our readers must be aware of the effect
produced when a particular nerve of the neck or leg is pressed during
an exercise. This very science the Japanese have perfected. A</p>

Japanese coach has, therefore, been employed to train the English
army, and thousands have already been taught the art. And <i>jiu-jitsu
</i>is the Japanese name for it. The problem will now be to find
something else after all the nations have learnt <i>jiu-jitsu</i>.
This process is bound to go on endlessly.</p>

The Agricultural Council of Barberton had appointed Captain Madge to
investigate if the soil surrounding that place was suitable for
growing tobacco. He reported that the land could yield a very rich
crop of tobacco. Thereupon, the committee of the Council has pro-
posed that, since Indians are needed to assist in the cultivation of
toba- cco, they should be admitted to the areas around Barberton on
the same terms as in Natal. Thus, the whites have begun to feel the
need for Indian labour right from the beginning, for the Kaffirs are
of no use and all the available Chinese are absorbed in the mines.
Indian labour, is, therefore, in general demand.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Lord Curzon has declared in his speech<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that,
 as  long  as  the South African Colonies do not concede adequate
rights to the Indians, they will receive no help from India. If,
therefore, the Transvaal Government does really need Indians, Lord
Curzon will have a golden opportunity to exert pressure in order to
secure the rights of Indians. The Transvaal is not likely to achieve
prosperity so long as agriculture is not introduced there. And there
is little likelihood of agriculture being developed without Indians.</p>

âWhy do women live longer than men, and the Kaffirs, Hot- tentots
and Malayas longer than the whites?â asks <i>The Cape Times</i>.
The question arises from a perusal of the Census Report. There are
more women than men in the Cape. The number of men is 12,18,940,
while that of women is 12,90,864. Up to the age of sixty the number</p>

of men is greater, but among those aged seventy, there are 21,788 men
and 23,719 women; among those aged eighty-five, 2,355 men and 2,895
women; and among those aged ninety five, 88 men and 109 women. There
are 300 persons in the Cape who are over a hun- dred years; of these,
only 126 are men and the rest women. Similarly, the Coloured
population is found to be more long-lived than the white.</p>

The reason for this is clear enough. As the Europeans indulge in
sensual pleasures more than the Coloured peoples, their lives are
shorter. Again, the duration of life among men is shorter than among
women because the former suffer more worries than the latter. The
Indians stand lower in the scale than all the other for a variety of
weighty reasons. But the main reason is the very poor standard of
life that the Indians maintain in South Africa. In order to save
money, our people live together in large numbers in single rooms; and
for the same reason or from indolence, they take food which is either
insuf- ficient or inadequately nutritive. Many live on ill-baked
bread made of musty flour. Small wonder, then, that such food has
adverse effects.</p>

Yes, Â£ 5/1/6 are what I sent you when you became a fixture in the
Press. I transferred that amount on to the Press just in order to
enable me to see in the end how I myself come out of it. Of course,
that and the charge of Â£ 16 for Shah will not be included in the

as also the 5/- paid to him for his razor. Please let me know whether
the Gujarati matter sent this week is enough, or whether I should
send still more.</p>

This question is one of those about which there is unanimity of
Indian and Anglo-Indian opinion; and I venture to think that united
action on the part of the non-official members will do much for our
cause. There is very little doubt that the official sympathy would
also be with us, and under the strong and sympathetic Viceroy we have
in Lord Curzon, the great question which underlies our disabilities
(as put by the London <i>Times</i>: âMay the British Indians when
they leave India have the same status before the law as other British
subjects enjoy? May they or may they not go freely from one British
possession to another and claim the rights of British subjects in
allied states?â) cannot but be decided favourably if only it is
sufficiently brought to His Excellencyâs attention.</p>

The Transvaal Constitution has been on the lips of everybody in South
Africa ever since its publication. We cannot recall an instance when
the constitution of a British Colony has evoked so much interest as
the one given to the Transvaal. Every newspaper has published lea-
ding articles: every important person in South Africa has offered his
judgment on it; and the sum and substance of the great body of opi-
nion that has gathered round the Constitution appears to be praise
not unmixed with unfriendly criticism. In fact, Lord Milner, in his
valedi- ctory address at Johannesburg, anticipated such a result when
he said that the Constitution would probably fail to please anybody
wholly, but that it would be accepted by all fair-minded men as a
genuine attempt to bring nearer together the British and the Boers,
and to prepare the people in the near future for complete
self-government.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The objections that have been taken to the details are, in our
opinion, objections taken because of ignorance of the history regar-
ding Constitutions for the other self-governing Colonies. The point
is that, even wherein there has been strong agitation for the grant
of self- government, or other representative institutions, there has
never been such a close examination of the details before. People
have hitherto</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 5%"><br/>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
been satisfied with the granting of a principle, but to-day we find
them insisting on every detail being arranged according to their
notions. Hence it is that exceptions are seriously taken to the
reservations by the Crown regarding legislation, although, if trouble
were taken to examine even Constitutions for the self-governing
Colonies, it would be found that the power of veto has been always
retained, and occasi- onally even exercised. For instance, when the
Australian Common- wealth passed its anti-Asiatic legislation
excluding Asiatics as such, Mr. Chamberlain had no hesitation in
disallowing the Act; and simi- larly in Natal. The first action of
the responsible ministry in disfran- chising Indians as such was
promptly checked by Lord Ripon. It is conveniently forgotten that the
Constitution which the Transvaal has received is perhaps the most
liberal yet known of all the Constitutions granted preliminary to
responsible government. The other objection taken, that the Orange
River Colony has not received the same treat- ment as the Transvaal,
goes to the root of all government. So long as Britain remains the
predominant power, and so long as governments must ultimately depend
upon force, it is useless to express dissatis- faction with what is,
in the nature of things, unavoidable.</p>

Apart, however, from the intrinsic merit of the Constitution, Mr.
Lytteltonâs despatch, which served as preamble to the Constitution
itself, is the most important of all. It is a humane document worthy
of a British minister.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Coming to the purely Indian standpoint, it is difficult not to feel
that the British Indian, as also the British Coloured man, is only
the step-child, and has been left out in the cold. He has no voice in
the affairs of the Colony, and he is insulted by deliberate
exclusion. Mr. Lyttelton says:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">His
Majestyâs Government have been unable, having regard to the Terms

<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.41cm">And
here it may be noted that even Mr. Lyttelton has made the</p>

common mistake of including other people in the term âNativeâ.
The Terms of Peace mention only the natives of South Africa. Why
should other Coloured people, then, be included by inference? Mr.
Lyttelton proceeds:</p>

Speaking on education in the Natal Parliament, Mr. Wiltshire said
that the Government should provide greater facilities for the
education of Indians. He pointed out that Indians needed them and
that a special responsibility devolved on the Government for the
education of Natal born Indians. We should be thankful to the Hono-
urable Gentleman for his speech. Our condition is likely to improve
in every way with the increasing spread of education. The Government
will no doubt have ultimately to discharge their duty in the matter.
It appears that, in the absence of a separate school for Indians in
Lady- smith, the Government have permitted Indians with a high
standard of life to be admitted to the existing school.</p>

Speaking in the Orange River Colony, Mr. Argette, the late Sup-
erintendent of Education in the Transvaal and the Orange River
Colony, declared that he would make special efforts for the education
of the Kaffirs in Basutoland. He is sufficiently mindful of the need
for technical education. He was very sympathetic about the education
of Indians, and was always trying to start schools for them in the
Trans- vaal.</p>

His Excellency Lord Selborne will arrive shortly in Johannes- burg.
From the account of his career given by the well-known journ- alist,
Mr. Stead, in the April issue of the <i>Review of Reviews</i>, it
appears that, when His Excellency made the speech about the war on
Novem- ber 1, 1899, he was secretary to Mr. Chamberlain. While
recounting, in the course of that speech, the causes of the war, he
said that the British Government fought it not in order to deprive
the Boers of their rights, but to accord equal rights both to Boer
and Briton. The British Government was not actuated by self-interest
or monetary considera- tion, but they wanted to determine and uphold
the rights of other peoples. The British Government were the trustees
of the people of Canada and Australia, the Negroes in South Africa
and the Indian immigrants in the Transvaal. It was, therefore, their
duty to wage war for the protection of these peoples. Since it was
the duty of the British to keep the promises they had made, they were
bound to protect the rights of all these peoples. It was the duty of
the British Government to protect the rights of British subjects
wherever they were, whether white or Coloured. It was on these
grounds that His Excellency defended the war.</p>

Quoting the above speech of Lord Selborne, Mr. Stead remarks, âLet
us see how Lord Selborne stands by what he has saidâ. Let us hope
the noble lord will stick to his words and add luster to the name of
England by relieving the Indians of the hardships they are labouring
under.</p>

all the difficulties which presented themselves to the Government at
the present time, none was harder than that dealing with the status
of British Indians in this country. The Government realised the
conspicuous and sple- ndid services which had been rendered to the
Empire by them in India and in other parts. The Government
appreciated the value of those services fully. People in this
country, however, recognised that the conditions governing the
Indians were not the same as those existing in the land from which
the latter came. Here prejudices had arisen in the minds of the
people owing to past history with coloured classes, and the question
of the Indiansâ presence was looked at from an entirely different
standpoint. He was sure the Indians must recognise this. The
Government was called on to hold the scales of justice impartially,
and the question was still a matter of correspondence be- tween the
Home Government and the Colonial administration.</font></font></p>

Excellencyâs advice to Mr. Lyttelton that promises made to the
British Indians, having been made in ignorance, were better broken
than fulfilled. The British Indian Association has shewn conclusively
that promises were made to the Indians in the Transvaal with full
know- ledge of the circumstances and by no means in ignorance. We
fear that His Excellency has, shall we say with deference, committed
the same mistake in his remarks quoted above. Why should he mix up
the Indians with other Coloured classes? If a majority of the white
people in the Transvaal will not see a distinction, is it not the
duty of the Government to educate them up to a proper appreciation of
it? How can Indians be expected to recognise unreasonable prejudice
if it is meant thereby that they should bow to it? Recognition of
such prej- udice is undoubtedly necessary; but it is so only in order
that it may be removed by calm discussion, and by placing constantly
before the public the true facts. The Government âwould hold the
scales of justice impartiallyâ only when it boldly tackles the
question, and instead of indirectly encouraging the current
prejudice, endeavours to stem its tide by taking up a firm attitude.
As to the carrying on of a correspondence with the Home Government,
we have good reason to believe that this is meant to wring from the
latter a consent to the imposing of further disabilities on British
Indians. Has His Excellency studied carefully the very moderate
propositions made by the British Indians in the Transvaal? Has his
Government ever told the people of the Transvaal that the claims put
forward by the Indians are extremely reasonable, and that they have
shewn a laudable desire to meet the views of the white Colonists so
far as possible?</p>

There appears, in a recent issue of the Cape <i>Government </i><i>Gazette</i>,
an interesting Bill to be introduced by Mr. T. L. Schreiner, the
well- known member of the Cape House of Assembly. Mr. Schre-iner is
known to be a philanthropist and a moralist. The Bill we are alluding
to is called the âYouthsâ Smoking Prevention Billâ, and is
intended to prohibit smoking by youths of or under the age of 16
years, or appearing to be so. The manner in which the Honourable
Gentleman wishes to achieve his object is very simple. The Bill makes
it criminal for any tobacconist to sell tobacco, cigars, or
cigarettes to boys appearing to be of 16 years or under. It also
authorises the police to confiscate and destroy any tobacco, pipe,
cigar or cigarettes</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.18cm; line-height: 86%; page-break-before: always"><a name="213. EARTHQUAKE IN INDIA"></a>
found on the person of such youths and authorises the parents or
guardians of the latter to sue the seller of the offensive product
for a refund of the money paid to him, notwithstanding destruction of
the things sold, whilst it also enables teachers in Government
schools to punish smoking by boys as a school offence. It has been
often said that people cannot be made sober by an act of Parliament,
and the same may be equally applicable to Mr. Schreinerâs Bill; but
we are not prepared to concur in the view that temperance legislation
has not been productive of some good. We are inclined to think that
this Bill, if it meet with the approval of the Cape House, will be a
step in the right direction. Smoking, in any case, is neither a
desirable nor a clean habit, and whilst, under certain circumstances,
it may be of some use, and may also be a great soother of pain, the
habit of smoking amon- gst boys is undoubtedly harmful, and ought to
be checked by all legitimate means. The Bill is, perhaps, proof of
the existence of the evil to a large extent. Indeed, we see the habit
often indulged in by telegraph boys and messengers who are much below
16 years. The specious plea is often put forward, in defence of
juvenile smoking, that, if it is good for adults, it could not be bad
for  youths.  A momentâs thought, however, would convince the
casuists that what is good for the one is not necessarily good for
the other; and smoking is one of such things which may not be
indulged in by boys with impunity. It undermines their constitution
and weakens their mental capacity. We, therefore, hope that Mr.
Schreiner will be able to induce the Cape Parliament to accept the
Bill.</p>

News received by the latest mail from India gives full details of the
havoc wrought by the earthquake. The Divine wrath that has descended
on the people of Northern India is such that it will not be forgotten
for years. Many an old historical monument, numerous villages,
palatial buildings in large cities, the simple huts of the poor and
tented camps of the army have all been devastated. Several fami- lies
have been totally wiped out. The greatest damage has been done to
Dharmasala, the Kangra valley, Palampur and Mussoorie. The acco- unt
of the condition of the victims of the calamity is very pitiable ind-
eed. Men were rendered quire helpless and died for want of food and
water, as no news whatever of the peopleâs condition could be had
from certain parts due to a breakdown of telegraphic communica-
tions. The Government evinced great sympathy and ran special trains</p>

have been opened in India as well as in Great Britain, and large sums
have already been contributed. Our readers must already be aware that
we, too have started a fund in aid of those unfortunate
fellow-Indians who have been suddenly reduced to a state of penury.
We hope everyone will do his duty and contribute to the fund to the

	The Managers of the International Printing Press have sent me your
	letter to them regarding the reprint of your <i>Bhagawad Gita</i>.
	The responsibility for the advice, as to the reprint and inclusion
	of the por- trait, must rest entirely on my shoulders. I know that
	ordinarily it would not be considered a proper thing to reprint a
	book without the authorâs permission. A gentleman offered to have
	a translation of the <i>Bhagawad </i><i>Gita </i>printed for
	distribution among Hindu boys and other if the Managers printed it
	at cost price. He was also in a hurry. Reprint of your translation
	was suggested. The matter was referred to me and, after much careful
	thought, as there was no time left for reference to you, I advised
	that your translation might be reprinted for circulation in South
	Africa. I felt that the motive of the management was pure, and that
	when the circumstances, under which the edition was pub- lished,
	were brought to your notice, you would overlook any apparent
	impropriety. Simultaneously with the publication, a letter,
	explaining the whole of the circumstances, was sent to you over the
	signature of the Manager and Proprietor. It seems to have
	miscarried. We were all wondering why there was no letter from you,
	either of disapproval or approval. Your letter of the 27th March,
	however, explains the absence of any previous communication from
	you. As to the portrait, I can only say that, if a mistake has been
	committed, it has arisen from excessive reverence for yourself. When
	I suggested the inclusion of</p>

the portrait, I had in my mind the interpretation that was likely to
be placed upon the act by some people, but I again felt that you
would not resent the indiscretion, if such it was, when you came to
know that a large number of the copies went to the Indian youths.
Rightly or wrongly, as you are aware, publication or printing of such
portraits in scared works is not uncommon in India. Only 1,000 copies
were printed. Of these, there are perhaps not more than 200 left, and
these are being distributed or sold now probably at the rate of 5 per
month, and then only among real inquirers.</p>

I have now placed the whole position before you, and it remains for
me to express my deep regret for the offence done to  your  feelings
and to apologise for it. If you consider that any public state- ment
is necessary, or complete withdrawal of the book from further
circulation, or simple taking out of the portrait is necessary, your
wishes shall be carried out.</p>

	I am glad the Editor forwarded the above letter to me, and I am
	grateful to Mr. Vavda for having expressed his views. There was only
	one object before me in delivering these speeches, viz., to  serve
	Indians. I readily accepted the invitation to give an ideal of the
	Hindu religion in India and what it stood for. While doing so, I
	found it necessary to compare it with other religions. But in this,
	my one consi- deration was to point out, as far as possible, the
	special excellences of each religion and create a favourable
	impression on the minds of the whites. All the facts stated by me
	were drawn from history, which we have been learning at school since
	childhood. That Islam was spread by force is a historical fact. But
	along with it, I also pointed out that the potent cause of  the  
	spread  of  Islam   was  its  simplicity  and  its</p>

special virtue of regarding all as equals. That the majority of
converts to Islam were Hindus from the lower classes is also a fact
that can be proved; and I, for one, do not consider that to be in any
way derog- atory. To me personally, there is no distinction between a
Brahmin and a <i>bhangi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. And I consider it a merit of Islam that those who were
dissatisfied with the social distinctions in Hinduism were able to
better their condition by embracing Islam. Nor did I suggest that all
the converts to Islam came only from the lower classes of Hindu
society. And I have not the least idea that by the lower classes are
meant only the untouchable Dheds. While I admit that men from the 
higher classes such as Brahmins and Kshatriyas also became Muslims,
it is universally known that the bulk of converts was not  drawn 
from among them. However, the point I want to emphasise is that no
stigma attaches to Islam if the Hindus of the lower castes became
Muslims. On the contrary, it shows its excellence, of which the
Muslims should be proud.</p>

As for the fervour or passion of Islam, I do hold the view I have
already stated. Mr. Vavdaâs interpretation of the word fervour or
passion is quite mistaken. I have used it in a complimentary sense,
and have clearly pointed out that it is a strong point of Islam.
Nothing worth while can be accomplished without real fervour. The
Turks could resist Russia and Greece successfully only when they
fought desperately with real fervour, and now all are afraid of the
Turkish soldiers. None could lay hands on Rajputana while the Rajputs
fought with fervour. Japan has been able to take the fort of Port
Arthur<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>only
because she has been fighting with fervour. Fervour is as necessary
in other tasks as it is in war, and it is a positive virtue. Edison
is making inventions because of passion. It was the passion of Watt
which let to the invention of the steam engine and made travelling in
the world easy. And we shall be able to come together and succeed in
our fight for the redress of our grievances against the whites if we
have the same passion. This passion is the special merit of Islam. We
shall benefit immensely if this very passion is brought to bear on
other tasks.</p>

I have nothing more to add. I know that the question that arose in
the mind of Mr. Vavda has arisen in the minds of others as well. I
have said what I considered to be true. In doing so, I had no
intention of offending the feelings of even a single individual. To
my mind, there is no distinction between a Hindu and a Muslim or
Christian. I have frequently said so and, I believe, I have been
acting accordingly.  I maintain that Hindu religion teaches us to
look upon all with an equal eye without making distinctions between
Hindu and Muslim, Brahmin and <i>bhangi</i>, and that is the religion
I follow.</p>

recover the full amo- unt. I am however hoping that we will. Having
gone so far I feel that we ought to print the 12 numbers. You are now
printing the eleventh and there will only remain the twelfth to be
published. For the rest, if they want us to publish them, we will
require a guarantee. I am glad you have received the Gujarati letter
about my lectures. Print it in full in the next issue and print also 
my letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>. It
shows that the paper is being eagerly read, and that is what we want.
Misunderstandings will sometimes happen. That however need not make
us flinch from our duty. Let that letter be printed first and
underneath my explanation. There was some talk of the same nature
here also, and though I have been trying to explain it, the letter
you have send me enables me to give much fuller and more public
explanation. For the time being, you may expect 32 sides of the
scribbling paper in Gujarati per week from me. Why was a bill sent to
N. Sen? Was it upon advice from Madanjit? You should write to the
gentleman telling him that the account was sent because Madanjit
wrote, if that is a fact; otherwise tell him that it was sent in
inadvertence and that the management apolo- gise for it. I enclose
for your perusal as also of Kitchin, West and Bean, if they have seen
Mrs. Besantâs letter, copy of my letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

you may mention the fact to them and show the copy. Evidently, Bean

	There is another Bill published which makes occupation by Indians of

	tax of one halfpenny per annum on every acre of unoc- cupied rural

	is insulting and unjust. It is Indians who have made the cultivation

Under the circumstances and in view of the fact that there seems to
be no warrant for a forfeiture, apart from an action at law, I
venture to trust that you will be pleased to authorise the Principal
Immigration Restriction Officer to refund the amount of the deposit.
I have no desire to lay stress upon the legal point, but I feel

	His Excellency made a lengthy reference to the status of the British
	Indians in South Africa, and the British Indian settlers must feel
	deeply indebted to him for his strong advocacy. His Excellency
	devoted a considerable portion of his speech to the situation in

	work done by the delegates who proceeded to India some time ago on
	behalf of the Natal Government. Their object was to impose further
	restrictions on indentured Indians by making their return, at the
	end of their service, absolutely compulsory. Lord Curzon, we are
	glad to be able to say, repudiated any such suggestion, unless
	certain concessions were granted by the Natal Government in favour
	of non-indentured Indians settled in the Colony. His Lordship asked
	for the eventual abolition of the Â£3 tax, amendment of the Dealersâ
	Licenses Act, as also of the</p>

All this is extremely satisfactory, and it shews that the Indian
appeal to the Viceroy has received very full consideration. His
Excel- lency added that he was able to obtain one concession, namely,
that three yearsâ residence in the Colony was accepted by the Natal
Gove- rnment as freeing Indian residents from the prohibition under
the Immigration Restriction Act. This means that His Lordship has
been led to believe that it was a concession granted by the Natal
Govern- ment. If so, we are sorry, because it would be a misleading
statement. As a matter of fact, the Natal Government were bound to
lay down certain rules with reference to the interpretation of the
term âprevious domicileâ. The law, as it stood, stated that those
Indians who were previously domiciled in the Colony were free from
the educational prohibition. In practice, two yearsâ residence was
accepted by Mr. Smith, as a rule, as evidence of previous domicile;
and it was on Mr. Smithâs recommendation that the Government have
raised the period to three years and embodied it in the Act. Also, we
may inform His Excellency that three yearsâ residence is not
necessarily to be acce- pted as sufficient evidence of domicile. We
make bold to say that, but for the amendment of the Act, it would not
be possible, even for an Indian who had resided in the Colony for six
months, and could prove that he had changed his residence to Natal
and intended to be domiciled, to be refused exemption. What,
therefore, His Lordship considers is a concession, we are, with great
deference, obliged to say, is no concession at all. The question,
however, is whether His Excel- lency can safely stop where he has
left the question.  During  the  current year, the Natal Parliament
has been actively pursuing an anti- Indian policy. We have already
drawn attention to Bills containing anti-Indian clauses. The Dealersâ
Licenses Act is a thing of constant worry and irritation. Is it
right, then, that Natal should still continue to draw upon India for
the staple of her prosperity, and reject the advances of the Indian
Government on behalf of free British Indians? To say the least, it is
a one-sided bargain, in which Natal gets all without giving anything
in return.</p>

His Lordship dwelt on the position in the Transvaal. His statement is
a recapitulation of Mr. Lytteltonâs despatch, but it shews that he
is fully alive to the interests of his wards. We hope that his
watchful guardianship will, in the near future, cause the Indians to
be released from the galling restraints under which they labour in
that Crown Colony.</p>

In a recent number of the <i>Natal Government Gazette</i>, there are
three Bills published which shew how bad the financial position of
the Colony is. One of the Bill is intended to impose a poll-tax of Â£1
per head on every adult male of the age of 18 years or over. It
exempts from liability to pay the tax, poor or infirm persons, as
also inden- tured Indians whilst they are under indenture. The second
Bill im- poses a succession duty on the estates of deceased persons,
the mini- mum duty, in the case of lineal descendants or ascendants
bearing one per cent. The two measures are likely, if they are
accepted by the Parliament of Natal, to produce a fair amount of
revenue.</p>

It is, however, the third Bill with which we are more immediately
concerned, and which raises a very important question, affecting the
Indian community. The Bill is entitled âTo Impose a Tax upon Un-
occupied Rural Landsâ. It is sought thereby to impose a tax of a
half penny per acre on every piece of unoccupied rural land of an
extent of 250 acres or upwards. Clause 5 of the Bill states that</p>

Thus, any piece of rural land that may be occupied by Indians in the
Colony, other than the owners, would, if the Bill becomes law, be
considered as unoccupied for the purpose of imposing the halfpenny
tax. The Bill may affect Indian landlords in the coast districts,
where land is cultivated only by Indians.</p>

This policy of constantly insulting and irritating the Indians
without cause ought, in the interests of the Empire, to be checked by
Mr. Lyttelton. It is true that Natal enjoys complete self-government,
and it is therefore at liberty to make its own laws; but when liberty
becomes license, it is a question whether the authorities in Downing
Street, who are the custodians of the honourable traditions of the
Empire, should not check legislation which insults British subjects
not directly represented in the Legislature.</p>

The Report of the Immigration Officer of the Cape, Dr. Gre- gory, on
the working of the Immigration Law in that Colony, has been
published. We find therein that, of the persons seeking entry into
the Cape last month, 298 were not allowed to enter. Of these, 56 were
disallowed because they were not literate in English, 156 because
they were paupers and 74 because they were illiterate and poor;
twelve were not allowed to land because they were prostitutes. Dr.
Gregoryâs view is that, because of hard times, many who would have
otherwise come have not been able to do so, and that, therefore, it
is not possible to say what the real effect of this law has been. He
also believes that many Indians were put to difficulty in not being
able to land. And even if it is held that this law is good for
preventing the entry of Indians, it is questionable whether it is
just to prevent British Indian subjects from entering, when
Yiddish-speaking Hebrews who are actual beggars can do so by
borrowing money from their friends. It seems from the Report that Dr.
Gregory himself regards this law as unjust. The Cape Government have
promised Indians in the Cape that the provision in the law regarding
language would be so amended as to make the knowledge of an Indian
language acceptable. It is the duty of leading Indians in the Cape to
get that promise implemented. We are sure that, if they pursue the
matter energetically, the Government will make the necessary changes
in the Act. We hope that the Cape Indians will take up the matter
vigorously and see it through.</p>

No one has served Bombay as well as Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. He has
been a member of the Corporation for the last thirty years and
attended its meetings, forgoing important lucrative cases. He is,
therefore, regarded as the Father of the Corporation. There is talk
of offering him the presidentship of the Corporation this year in
view of the forthcoming visit to India of the Prince of Wales. Since
he already holds a knighthood, <i>The Times of India </i>suggests
that it would be only proper for the Government to confer on him the
title of Lord Mayor, when he assumes the office of President. If the
Presidents of the Corporations of Melbourne and Sydney can be Lord
Mayors, why not those of Calcutta and Bombay?</p>

I hope that the description is an unconscious mistake on the part of
the official who has issued the warning. I need hardly draw your
attention to the fact that the description is in the highest degree
offensive, and that it would be totally wrong to describe Messrs. M.
C. Camroodeen &amp; Co. as âcooliesâ. I may add, theirs is one of
the oldest established British Indian firms in South Africa</p>

have it translated in Tamil, Hindi and Urdu also. See that the
translation is accurate. Please print the whole [in] four languages

that the matter is of immediate importance, and seeing that it is a

pressure of work. Use decent paper. No proof is required, so that
there need be no delay. I send you the original in English also, in

Empire Dayâthe anniversary of the birth of the late Queen-
Empressâis a day set apart by universal consent in all parts of the
Empire outside Great Britain to commemorate the reign of its most
beloved Queen. It is but a deeper tribute to her memory that it is
becoming known as âEmpireâ rather than as âVictoriaâ Day; for
it is a recognition that no person has done more to draw together the
units of those vast Dominions of which she was the Queen-Empress. By
her large heart and wide sympathy; by her abilities and queenly
virtues; above all, by her personal goodness as a woman, she has for
ever enshrined herself in the hearts of every nation under the
British flag. The lesser persons who administered her power might
make mistakes; injustice even might be committed in her name; but the
people ever knew that the mistakes and the injustice came not from
Victoria the Good. As wife and as mother, she proved herself as
worthily as Queen; and knowing that domestic virtue alone makes a
household happy and prosperous, she was a firm believer in the scrip-
tural statement: Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is a
reproach to any people. She saw, before all others, that the British
Empire must</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
be founded on the rock of righteousnessâindividual and nationalâif
it were to have a permanent prosperity. Other nations and other
Empires the past has held; but all have been broken on this ârock
of offenseâ. From the first, when she spoke those simple words: âI
will be goodâ, she endeared herself to her subjects the world over.
It may be noted here that Victoria owed her greatness in very large
part, under Providence, to her own wise mother; and both before and
since, great men and women without number have dutifully acknowledged
the same. It is always true that a good mother makes a wise child. As
another instance of this, we have but to see the universal
satisfaction that is felt with the present occupant of the British
throne, who by his tack and wisdom has already done so much for the
Empire and the world. Of all contemporary monarchs, King Edward best
exhibits that peculiar genius which constitutes true kingship; and
this is due in most part to the influence of his august Mother.</p>

In every way, then, Victoria is a name worthy to be honoured when we
think of the Empire; and it is but fitting that the day set apart
should be the anniversary of the hour that brought her into the
world.</p>

To Indians especially, Victoria Day should be sacred. No other person
has done so much for the liberty of India as the late Queen- Empress.
That this was recognised by the millions of India was apparent by the
remarkable demonstrations of mourning that took place throughout
India on her decease. Speaking of her, the Viceroy said:</p>

hearts of all the Indian people had been drawn together by this
singular and beautiful combination of mother, woman and queen. It was
easy to say much about the mark which this marvelous reign had left
upon the history of India, and to indicate many points where the
sagacious hand and influence of the deceased Sovereign had been felt;
but were not all her reign and character summed up in the famous
Proclamation of 1858, the Magna Charta of India, and the golden guide
of our conduct and our aspirations? It might be said of her that she
turned Great Britain into a worldwide Empire, with India as its
corner- stone.</font></font></p>

Victoriaâs interest in India was always personal and profound. Not
only did she surround herself with Indian servants; not only did she
learn to speak and write Hindustani (no light task to one burdened
with the cares of State); but she made the Viceroy send an account of
the situation in India <i>by every mail</i>. And that her knowledge
of Indian affairs was intimate is shewn by the following extract from
one of her letters to Lord Northbrook.</p>

âThe same before Godâ âthat was the spirit which inspired the
great Proclamation; and of which the Empire has scarcely proved
itself worthy. It is with regret that we say it; and it is with

of the Supreme Court, and the parties were left to have an
adjudication as to their rights. The plaintiffs, therefore, sued the
defendant for a declaration of rights, and demanded that an order
should be issued to the Master for payment of the money to them. The
defence raised was, first, that the plaintiffs, being British
Indians, could not, in virtue of Law 3 of 1885, hold landed property,
and that, therefore, the agreement on the part of Lucas to hold it
for them was illegal and void, and, therefore, not capable of being
enforced at law. The second ground of defence was that, even if it
was competent for Lucas to enter into the agreement with the
plaintiffs, the latter had only a personal right against him, and
could thus only prove their claim as concurrent creditors, but could
not make good their claim to the money on the strength of a universal
right, in other words, as preferent creditors. Sir William Smith,
though not without some hesitation, decided the point in favour of
the plaintiffs, and gave judgement with costs. From this the
defendant appealed, and the Supreme Court has adjudged on the appeal
in favour of the defendant, holding, with him on the second defence
raised. The net result, however, of this important judgement seems to
be that the holding by Europeans of land for Indians is not illegal,
but that, in the event of the insolvency of such Europeans, the
Indians concerned must take the risk, unless their names are
registered on the title-deeds, as <i>cestuis </i><i>que </i><i>trustent</i>.
This case, therefore, takes the Indians a step further in their
fight, and renders Law 3 of 1885 still more ineffective as a weapon
to be used against them. It would be most interesting to test
whether, as a matter of fact, if an Indian insisted on his name being
registered as a <i>cestui </i><i>que </i><i>trust</i>, his name could
be so registered. In the event of the successful prosecution of such
a test case, Indians would practically be able to hold land in any
part of the Transvaal without the slightest risk; and looking at it
from a common sense standpoint, we are  inclined to think that if
follows as a corollary from the judgment of the Supreme Court. It
would certainly be equitable, seeing that it has now been decided
that Natives are free to hold landed property in any part of the
Transvaal, and to have it registered in their own names.</p>

It is with very great regret that we notice some correspondence in an
East London journal between a Mahomedan and a Hindu. We should have
thought that the palpable need for the utmost harmony between all
sections of the Indian community in South Africa would have prevented
amenities<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>of
this nature. We do not desire to go into the merits of the letters,
but merely to express out disapprobation of this kind of thing. We
trust the writers will have the good sense to join in our regret and
leave the correspondence where it stands. There are other and
weightier matters that can more usefully employ their attention. We
may perhaps be allowed to remind our readers that <i>Indian Opinion
</i>is a journal specially devoted to the discussion of all Indian
affairs in South Africa; and that, if unfortunately differences arise
between Indians, our columns are the natural and most fitting medium
for their ventilation.</p>

Sir Mancherji asked Mr. Lyttelton why Indians were excluded from the
right to vote in the Transvaal Constitution. He asked further whether
or not the Constitution would be amended in order to enfranchise
them. Mr. Lyttelton replied that the Boers interpreted the terms of
the Peace Treaty, signed on the cessation of hostilities, to mean
that no Coloured person would get the right to vote until the
Transvaal attained full self-government. In deference to this
interpre- tation, Mr. Lyttelton had excluded the Indians so as not to
give any ground to the Boers to doubt the honesty of the British
Government. The word used in the terms of the Treaty is âNativeâ
and not âColo- ured peopleâ. Now the word âNativeâ can in no
way be interpreted to mean âIndiansâ. That word is invariably
used in South Africa for the natives of this country. The practice of
including Indians and other Coloured people in the term âNativeâ
is of recent origin, and that too only when it is specifically so
laid down in a law. It  is surprising that Mr. Lytteltton should have
given the above expl- anation when the word is not normally so
interpreted even today. If Indians are thus included in the term
âNativeâ, great harm is likely to done to them.</p>

There is not the slightest likelihood of the Dutch or the British
granting the franchise to Indians on the attainment of self-govern-
ment. Sir George Farrar, a noted gentleman of the Transvaal, has

would not even dream of granting rights to an Indian, in preference
to a âNativeâ.</p>

Smallpox has made its appearance in Johannesburg. It is said to have
entered through passenger steamers. It started with the Malay
Location. The first case was a Malay one, followed by another of a
white. According to Dr. Porter, five Indians have also been affected.
Great strictness is being observed in the Malay Location; peopleâs
houses are being inspected morning and evening.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 102%">
Much inconvenience is likely to be caused if smallpox spreads
further. Compulsory inoculation has been introduced in the Malay
Location. But that is not all. Regulations have been framed by the
Town Council, and when they come into force, much difficulty is
likely to be felt.</p>

The remedy lies in the peopleâs own hands. To keep the tenements
clean, to bathe daily, to keep water, milk, etc., clean, to put on
clean clothes, and to let plenty of air and light into the house;
these are the preventive measures for smallpox or any other illness. 
If  anyone in the house catches the disease, the fact should
immediately be intimated to the authorities. The more the people
conceal such diseases out of fear, the greater will be their
hardships, the  more  widely will the disease spread, and the greater
will be the repression by the authorities. The patient is bound
eventually to be removed to hospital. If, therefore, we inform the
authorities of our own accord,</p>

if he is removed to hospital; on the contrary, he may recover the

	I must confess that your letter enclosing cheque staggers me because
	I venture to think that there is a principle at stake. The cheque
	was given to me ear-marked. You know the money belonged to me. It
	did not come out of anything I had for Said Ismail, and seeing that
	the property to buy which it was given was not purchased, I think I
	was entitled to a return of the full cheque. I know that I wonât
	come to grief with reference to the charges deducted by you, but, to
	my mind, it is hardly conducive to the growth of confidential
	relations which ought to exist between professional men. I hope you

In a recent number of <i>India</i>, Sir William Wedderburn, one of
Indiaâs truest friends, has contributed an appreciative article on
the affairs of Baroda, a State in the Presidency of Bombay with a
popu- lation of two millions, and with territories covering an area
of eight thousand square miles; in other words, a State a little
bigger than Wales. Sir William has based his appreciation on the
report of admin- istration issued by Mr. R. C. Dutt,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>at
one time Acting Commissioner of Orissa, now Finance Minister of
Baroda, and who is known to the literary world as a brilliant author.
The Maharaja Gaekwar himself, one of the most cultured Princes of
India, has surrounded himself with able councillors, of whom Mr. Dutt
is the brightest star. Mr. Dutt has written works expounding his view
as to the amelioration of the poverty of the masses in India. His
chief remedy is to make the revenue system as elastic as possible,
and as soon as he accepted office in Baroda, he was allowed to put
his views into force. Instead, now, of the cultivator having to pay a
fixed tax in coin, he has, under well- defined rules, the opportunity
of either paying in coin or in kind. This takes us back to the
pre-British period, when the ryot throughout India paid a certain
portion of his produce to the paramount lord. This was suited to the
genius of the people and most convenient to either party. The
paramount lord then shared the prosperity of the ryot and suffered
with him in adversity. The Maharajaâs councillor has also done away
with petty, vexatious cesses. Nor does Mr. Duttâs activity stop at
revenue reform. He holds decided views on education. An advanced
district of the State has been selected for an experiment in
compulsory education. According to Mr. Duttâs report, the follo-
wing is the position of education in Baroda as compared with British
India:</p>

none are the results more real and tangible. The percentage of the
State revenue spent on education is 6.5 in Baroda, as against 1.17 in
Bengal, 1.44 in Bombay, 1.33 in Madras, and about 1 per cent in all
British India. And the percentage of children under instruction to

Mr. Dutt, again, is very deeply interested in the problem of self
government, and reviving or keeping up the great village communities
of India, which have been so graphically described by the late Sir
Henry Maine as self-contained republics. Mr. Dutt has, therefore,
endowed the villages with control of their own management and has
given certain powers to the headman, revived the village school-
master, and upon the old system he has engrafted real elective repre-
sentation. The village Panchayat, instead of being hereditary, will
now be elected by the people. It is a bold experiment, and, if it
succeeds, it will form a landmark in the government of Indian States,
and as Sir William Wedderburn says, it may well be that the British
Indian Gov- ernment may have to copy Baroda; nor, adds Sir William,
need there be any hesitation or shame about it, as it should be a
matter of pride to the British Government, which has, after all,
given to India the present Maharaja of Baroda, and an administrator
of Mr. Duttâs remarkable capabilities. To our South African
readers, a State like Baroda ought to serve as a help to dispel
prejudices and illusions about India, for a country which has so much
that is good, so much that is progressive, cannot after all be termed
a country inhabited by savages or a semi- civilised, barbarous race.</p>

We have been receiving for some time past copies of a journal called
<i>The </i><i>Indian </i><i>Sociologist</i>, and âorgan of freedom,
and of  political, social and religious reformâ. It is edited by
Pandit Shyamaji Krishnavarma, M.A. (Oxon.), sometime lecturer at
Oxford, and is published in London. It is a journal fearlessly
edited, and the editor is imbued with the teaching of the late
Herbert Spencer. The journal is evidently inte-nded to model Indian
opinion in accordance with Spen- cerâs teachings. The Pandit is an
Indian scholar of distinction, and has a fair amount of capital at
his command. He has established several scholar-ships for Indian
students in order to enable them to carry on their post-graduate
studies in Europe and America. Each scholarship is worth 2,000 rupees
and is given to selected graduates from all parts of India, the chief
conditions being that the candidates must remain and study for at
least two years in Europe or America, and must not, on any account,
accept government service. The candidates are also expected to enter
into an agreement to refund the money thus</p>

advanced in easy instalments after the completion of study. As a
result of the first competition, the following five candidates have
already been selected: Abdullah Al-Mahmun Suhrawdy, M.A., Sarat
Chandra Mukerji, M.A., Parmeshwar Lall, M.A., Syud Abdul Majid, B.A.,
and Shaikh Abdul Aziz, B.A. The experiment is a very bold one. The
donorâs intentions are patriotic. Its success, however, will very
largely depend upon the manner in which the first scholars use their
oppor- tunity. Their scholastic qualifications certainly betoken a
happy aug- ury. We wish every success to Pandit Shyamaji Krishnavarma
in his enterprise. His example may well be copied by the Indian
merchants in South Africa and elsewhere.</p>

Mr. Samuel Smith says that, if this reform is introduced, it will
give Indians great satisfaction and facilitate good administration.
He further adds that the greatest malady India suffers from is
poverty. In order, therefore, to make the people happy and contented,
the land revenue should be settled permanently and should not be
excessive. If the Government would consider these suggestions of Mr.
Smith, it will surely yield good results.</p>

deputation to England was passed at the last Congress session with
this end in view. The journal, <i>India</i>, tells us that Sir
William Wedderburn, a staunch friend of India, has issued a circular
in this regard, requesting the members from all the big towns in
Britain to organise meetings to hear the tale of Indiaâs woes from
these representatives. Mr. Gokhale,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; line-height: 102%">
C.I.E. has been appointed the leader of this deputation. He is the
same Mr. Gokhale who served as professor at the Fergusson College,
Poona, taking a mere pittance to maintain himself. He is at present a
member of the Imperial Legislative Council, Calcutta; year after
year, he puts up a fight on behalf of India in that House.</p>

There occurred in India 65,780 cases of plague during the last week
of April, of which 57,702 proved fatal. There were 23,387 deaths in
the United Provinces,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>19,015 in the Punjab, 3,056 in the Bombay Presidency and
9,703 in Bengal. The <i>Liberty Review </i>has passed severe
strictures on the British Government whom it holds responsible for
the epidemic, and for this large number of deaths, for, it adds,
there is extreme starvation in the land. It has been estimated that
only three out of the thirty crores of the people get even one meal a
day. This much is certain, that if a man obliged to starve, his body
gradually gets weaker and at last becomes so reduced in resistance
that it becomes more easily susceptible to infection or an attack of
germs. Nevertheless, we must say that the criticism of the <i>Liberty
Review </i>is  to a certain extent unjustified. We can say from
experience that the pla- gue does not attack only the starving. We
see that even those with a high standard of living are victimised by
it. Moreover, we can add the following from experience:</p>

We can see from this that plague has not much to do with starvation.</p>

Doubtless the main thing to do in the case of plague is  to observe
cleanliness. Cleanliness does not mean merely bathing and washing. It
is well to maintain personal cleanliness. But in addition to it, the
house also should be kept clean; sufficient light and sunshine should
be let into it; latrines should be kept clean; and in a house which
is affected, things should be so arranged that the things used for
the patient are not used by others. How to deal with plague is a wide
subject, and we cannot say much about it here. However, our readers
should remember that there is no other disease so deadly  as  the
plague. Cholera has always been considered a deadly disease, but it
is nothing as compared to plague. Moreover, plague is increasing
daily in India and not on the decline. For, whereas there were
2,72,000 deaths in 1901, there were 5,00,000 in 1902 and 8,00,000 in
1903; and this year the attack has been so virulent that the number
might easily shoot up to a million. The average number of deaths per
month this year comes to about 1,20,000<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. If mortality continues at this rate and goes on
increasing from year to year, it will be little wonder if the whole
of India becomes depopulated within 15 years. Several villages have
already been laid waste. At many places in the Punjab, public works
have come to a stop. Men who have survived the plague have deserted
the villages. This should set every Indian thinking. Every Indian
should search his heart and realise what his duty is.</p>

They seem to have made preparations long ago, and to have faithfully
carried out the requirements of the private secretary to His Excel-
lency. Although the receptions given to Lord Selborne were non-
political, we notice that the Mayors both at Pretoria and
Johannesburg could not refrain from alluding to the Indian question.
Opinion would be divided as to the appropriateness of bringing the
question thus early to the notice of Lord Selborne. The Mayor of
Johannesburg, Mr. George Goch, who is otherwise a most liberal-minded
gentleman, and who has often taken up the cause of the Coloured races
in South Africa, allowed himself, in reply to the toast on his
health, to remark that the last despatch from Sir Arthur Lawley on
the British Indian question, addressed to Mr. Lyttelton, showed the
true position, and that the community owed him much</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: -0.07cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">for
lifting up that question on a plane which was far above that which
any of them could conceive, and has given a basis in that despatch
for the settlement of a most intricate and most difficult question in
the new legislature, which by and by they would have under his
guidance.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
Now we have shown, conclusively we think, how that despatch is full
of inaccuracies and sentiments hardly creditable to a British
statesman. We have a very high regard for Sir Arthur Lawley. We
believe him to be actuated by excellent motives; but we regret to
have to say that he has been entirely misled on this question, and
has been over-mastered by the prevailing prejudice to which he has
succumbed. He has not hesitated to advise the Colonial Secretary to
break the oft- repeated promises of the British Government, and has
no doubt unc- onsciously misquoted facts in support of such dangerous
advice. The strength of the British Government lies very largely in
its rectitude and in its scrupulous observance of promises. It is
true that, on many an occasion, there has been a departure from it,
and on each such occ- asion, British prestige has suffered. No
statesman recalls such depar- tures with pride, but either glosses
them over, or offers to explain them away, thus indirectly showing
the British statesmen do not intend to fall away from the high
standard. It is, therefore, a disquieting sign to find a gentleman of
Mr. George Gochâs standing ranging himself on the side of those who
favour a policy which is calculated to revolutio- nise British
methods. It nevertheless shows the temper of the Transvaal community
on the British Indian question, and practical politicians have to
take note of that feeling.</p>

A good deal of discussion is still going on in England regar- ding
the employment of the Chinese in the Johannesburg mines. To pacify
the minds of the people in the matter, Lord Milner had, before
leaving South Africa, sent some communication to England, which has
now been published. Lord Milner states therein that the <i>per </i><i>capita
</i>expenditure of recruiting and bringing the Kaffirs to
Johannesburg has been Â£10-15-0 during the last three years, while
the cost of getting the Chinese is Â£16-11-3 per head. From this,
Lord Milner wants to suggest that the miners do not stand to gain in
recruiting the Chinese. Moreover, the cost of maintaining the Chinese
in Johannesburg is greater than that of maintaining the Kaffirs. For,
while a Kaffir costs 5 <sup>3</sup> d. per day, a Chinese costs 11d.
Lord Milner, therefore, concludes</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
that, if the Kaffirs can be had in sufficient numbers, the miners
would leave the Chinese alone. But 30,980 Chinese have already
entered the Transvaal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.19cm; line-height: 95%"><a name="265. JAPAN AND RUSSIA"></a>
In all this computation, Lord Milner has overlooked one fact, viz.,
that, while the Kaffir hardly works for six months, the Chinese have
to do so continuously for three years. Moreover, the Chinese being
more active than the Kaffirs, much more work can be taken from them
than from the latter. This is a very important point, but His
Lordship utters not a word about it. Unless this is taken into
account, Lord Milnerâs figures are of no use whatever. Were it not
so, those who pay a higher salary to the more efficient make,
according to Lord Milner, a mistake. We, therefore, feel that Lord
Milnerâs communi- cation is not likely to have much effect in
England.</p>

Japanâs star seems to be in the ascendant. She stormed the Fort of
Port Arthur, captured Mukden and has done other deeds of valour. But
all these pale into insignificance before her latest exploit. Not
only did she defeat the great Russian fleet, but wounded its great
Admiral and did not leave intact a single Russian man-of-war. No one
ever imagined that Japan was capable of such bravery. Many had

Russian fleet reached Singapore. It was also known that the Japanese
Navy was not very strong, that is to say, it had fewer battleships
than Russia. But in scouting and watchfulness, Japan surpassed all 
the others. Admiral Togoâs spies were very accurate in their
intelligence, and he pounced upon the Russian fleet just when it was
most vulnerable. This was no ordinary deed of daring. Such courage is
incomparable; but we consider supreme the patience and the cool
composure shown by Admiral Togo in achieving his  objective.  Nothing
was done with a view to winning honours or showing off their bravery
to the world. Togo had only one objective, viz., to strike at Russia
at the opportune moment and at the strategic place. That he has done;
and Russia, which only two years ago was considered to be almost
invincible, has now very nearly fallen into the hands of Japan. It is
said that history has nothing which can bear comparison with this
naval battle. England won a great [naval] victory in the sixteenth
century. The âinvincibleâ Spanish Armada was then destroyed in
the English Channel, and the British Admiral was triumphant. That too
has been considered a very fierce battle; but the Heavens then came
to the succour of England. The Spanish Armada was very large, and the
Channel narrow. And just as the battle was raging, a strong  wind
began to blow, which the Armada could not withstand, while it proved
favourable to the English fleet.</p>

What, then, is the secret off this epic heroism? We  have repeatedly
to ask ourselves this question and find an answer for it. The answer
is: unity, patriotism and the resolve to do or die. All the Japa-
nese are animated by the same spirit. No one is considered greater
than the other, and there is no rift of any kind between them. They
think of nothing else but service to the nation. They have so
identified themselves with their motherland that they consider
themselves prosperous [only] if they bring prosperity to the country
in which they are born, bred, and destined to pass their lives; that,
if the country</p>

rose, they rose; if she enjoyed political power, they were partners
in that power. Such is their patriotism. This unity and patriotic
spirit together with a heroic indifference to life [or death] have
created an atmosphere in Japan the like of which is nowhere else to
be found in the world. Of death, they do not entertain any fear. To
die in the service of their country, they have always regarded as
wholly good. If, after all, one has to die some day, what does it
matter if one dies on the battle-field? There is no certainty that,
if one stays home and does not go to the front, one will live longer.
And even if one did live very long, what was the good of living as a
subjugated people? Reasoning along these lines, the Japanese have
become defiant of death. What wonder, then, that those, who thus
sacrifice their flesh, blood and bones, should prove invincible on
the battle-field?</p>

But how will these thoughts avail us? What have we to learn from
them? We do not find the requisite unity even in the minor struggle
we are carrying on in South Africa; splits occur every day. Instead
of patriotism, we see more of selfishness everywhere. âIf only I am
saved, it does not matter if the others perish,â is the  thought
constantly on our mind. Our life is so dear to us that we pass away
while we are still fondling it. If we do not achieve good in this
world, what hope is there of achieving it in the next? This is the
condition most of us are in. Our reading this account of the Japanese
War will have been fruitful only if we emulate to some extent at
least the example of Japan. We shall gain nothing by mere reading
just as parrots do not attain to Heaven by repeating the name of
Rama.</p>

Licence Case, as it is a very strong one; if we do not put up a
fight, we shall have to regret it later. We should also send money to
help Mr. Madanjit, who is carrying on a commendable agitation on our
behalf in India.</p>

It appears some people have misconstrued the speeches I delivered at
Johannesburg<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>.
I had no intention in those speeches to hurt the susceptibilities of
the Mahomedans. We should not discri- minate between Hindus and
Mahomedans. We know very well what the Japanese have been able to
achieve through unity and accord. Though we profess different
religions, we should regard ourselves as one in the matter of public
work.</p>

Dr. Turner of Bombay has addressed a long letter to the Gover- nment
of that Presidency, stating that plague was on the increase from year
to year and that the only way to eradicate it was for the people to
have themselves inoculated. The Doctor believes that those who are
inoculated rarely suffer an attack of the plague. But the great
problem is how to persuade people to get themselves inoculated. Dr.
Turner says that it is not possible to compel people to do so. It
would be indeed very good, if the employers compelled their workers,
but that takes time, so that will not do either. Finally Dr. Turner
suggests that the Government should insure the life of the inoculated
person, and endorse a document to the effect that, if the person dies
within a year of the inoculation, they would pay his relatives Rs.
100. The Doctor hopes that this will induce many persons to undergo
inoculation. Another doctor suggests instituting a lottery for those
who get them- selves inoculated. Chits bearing the names of the
inoculated should be prepared, lots drawn, and prizes awarded to
winners. Thus are these good men struggling in vain to eradicate the
plague.</p>

It is possible that some men may be able to save themselves through
inoculation. But we see no advantage in this. This remedy of
inoculation is just like the means adopted by men, given to the
pursuit of pleasure, to escape the consequences of their indulgence.
Inocula- tion does not extirpate the causes of the plague and unless
these are removed, no real benefit can accrue. If, by chance, one
does get rid of plague, another disease will appear in its place.
Just as a tree is not destroyed unless its roots are pulled out, so
also the plague will not disappear unless its causes are removed. It
is necessary to bring about</p>

an improvement in the sanitary habits, morality and the economic
condition of the people. I believe that we commit sin by not
observing the rules of sanitation. Our moral standard is low, for we
neglect our duties. Added to this, there is poverty which brings many
miseries in its train. He will be considered a true alleviator of
Indiaâs ills, who can think out a remedy for this, and, having
discovered it, puts it into practice. Only after these essential
remedial steps have been taken will it be proper for us to take other
measures to supplement them.</p>

From the figures published in the journal, <i>India</i>, relating to
the military aid England receives from India, we learn that a troop
of 8,215 soldiers had come to South Africa in 1899; a platoon of
14,371 men was sent out to China, when the Boxer Rebellion broke out
in that country; and 3,376 Indian soldiers were sent to Somaliland.
These figures are exclusive of those who are stationed in Tibet as

	I went to your firm when I visited Durban last week. Omar Sheth,

	I see that Mr. Loveday has again repeated his statement about the
	influx of Indians into the Colony, in total disregard  of the
	evidence that he admits having seen after he first gave currency to
	those statements. Mr. Loveday thinks that the Permit Department does
	not keep out British Indians, and that non-refugees have been
	entering the Colony. In the face of the report of the Chief
	Secretary for Per- mits, one can only come to the conclusion that
	Mr. Loveday declines to believe the report. I can only say that even
	the British Indian refu- gees find it extremely hard to enter the
	Colony. I have before me a letter, addressed from the Permit Office
	to a British Indian, who  applied some seven months ago for a permit
	asking him whether he still requires a permit. The poor refugee
	being friendless, after having waited months for making good his
	right as a refugee to enter the Transvaal, has gone back to India,
	and the letter has been sent to me by the gentleman whose address he
	gave. Nor is this a solitary ins- tance. Whereas Europeans, whether
	they are refugees or not, obtain their permits for the asking, the
	Indian refugees, many of whom have paid the sum of Â£ 3 as the price
	of being allowed to remain in the country during the old regime,
	have to wait at least two months before they are admitted, and then,
	too, each applicant has to go through a number of formalities and a
	good deal of expense before he can enter the Colony. He must call at
	the Permit Offices in the coast towns for an application form. He
	has to get it filled in, for which, as a rule, he pays a fee. On
	receipt by the Permit Office in Johannesburg, letters are sent down
	to those whose names have been given as references. These letters
	have to make affidavits on which a half-crown stamp has to be
	affixed. If the evidence produced as to previous residence is
	considered satisfactory, a notification is sent to the applicant
	authori- sing him to enter the Colony. Nor is this all. He must then

examination, and if he satisfies the examining officer, he receives a
permanent authority to stay in the Colony. I know cases in which many
have been sent back because they were not able to satisfy the
examining officer that they were refugees. If, therefore, any one
could possibly complain against the Permit Department, it would be
the British Indians; and they do not belong to the criminal  class
mentioned by Mr. Hosken. Mr. Loveday has once again brought up the
statistics published by the Mayor of Pietersburg,  and  yet  the
Mayor of Pieters-burg has not taken up the challenge of the British
Indian Association, although it was he who provoked it. I venture to
quote from the letter addressed to you by the Chairman of the British

The names of all these store-keepers have been given in the same
letter. This statement has never been disproved, but Mr. Loveday says
the Asiatic Tradersâ Commission report that there was only one
Indian trader in Pietersburg without a licence before war. This is
misleading. I have before me the full report of the Asiatic Tradersâ
Commission. In the first place, it is an interim report. In the
second place, the Com-missioners do not pretend to have ascertained
the number of Indians who were trading without licences. All that the
Commissioners have done is to mention the respective claims placed
before them, and they state that there was only one British Indian
claim for Pietersburg. They had in all only 233 claims presented to
them. That surely does not exhaust the list of Asiatic traders before
war. The newspapers also published the information that the British
Indian claims were all with-drawn after the ruling that the
Commissioners gave as to their autho-rity, and that the British
Indians ceased to participate in their delibera- tions. The
Commissioners add that their work was interrupted by the decision of
the Supreme Court in the now famous test case about the right of a
British Indian to trade freely in the Colony. Knowing, as he must
have done, all these facts in connection with the report, it is
stra-nge that a responsible politician like Mr. Loveday should allow
him-self thus to mislead the public by making a statement which
cannot be proved. I admit that the Indian population in the Location
at Pretoria has increased. Probably, it has increased also in
Pietersburg and Potchefstroom. Will he also take note of the fact
that the Location in Johannesburg has been wiped out;</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always"><a name="275. LETTER TO DADABHAI NAOROJI"></a>
that there are not at present half the number of the British Indians
who used to occupy the old Location; and that, during the last  three
months, not less than 300 Indians have left Johannesburg? According
to the statistics placed before Mr. Conyngham Greene, there were in
the Transvaal before the war 15,000 Indians. Not more than 12,000
permits have been issued to them by the Permit Department, and as the
number of Indians leaving the Colony is greater than the number that
is allowed to enter the Colony, I venture to submit that there are at
present in the Colony less than 12,000 Indians. Mr. Loveday adds that
indentured Indians of Natal, who have just become free, have gone to
Potchefstroom and established themselves, a fact which is resented by
the Indians them-selves in Potchefstroom. Will the honourable
gentleman condescend to give the names of the Indians who have thus
entered the Colony? He would certainly then be rendering a great
service to his consti-tuents, the anti-Asiatic vigilants. Will he
also be pleased to give the names of the Indians who have stated that
they are being inundated by Indians from Natal, and if he cannot,
will he have the grace to with-draw the serious statements he has
made?</p>

	I send herewith copy of <i>Indian Opinion</i>. The leading article
	shows to what extent it has now become possible under Law 3 of 1885
	for the Indians to own land. The Supreme Court decision practically
	leaves them free, so long as they can get a European friend to
	become  a trustee, to own fixed property. I draw your attention to
	the fact so that, in any legislation that may be drafted there, it
	may not be taken for granted that, under Law 3 of 1885, it is
	impossible for the Indians to own property.</p>

	From what has been going on here, it appears that the new

	of the Government here to give any greater rights that [those]

All this legislation is unnecessary and insulting. I, therefore,
venture to think that, as stated by Lord Curzon in his Budget speech,
it is time that the next step was taken, namely, to suspend
indentured Indian immigration to Natal, unless the Natal Government
would cease their anti-Indian activity and amend, at any rate, the
Dealersâ Licenses Act so as to give the aggrieved party the right
to appeal to the Sup- reme Court.</p>

It is true that patriotic fervour surges in everyoneâs breast du-
ring times of war. This fervour is very beneficial. Many a patriot
has, under the stimulus of zeal, performed, with only a small army,
feats that have astounded the world. While, on the one hand, some
people abound with such enthusiasm, hundreds, thousands, nay, lakhs,
of lives have, on the other, been lost, ruined or reduced to a state
of depen- dence, through the doings of some selfish people who took
adv-  antage of the inability of officials to exercise sufficient
control during war. Taking advantage of the chaos, normal persons
have added to the prevailing disorder by committing, during war,
misdeeds which they will not think of at other times. It seems that
the rules of honesty and good conduct are entirely forgotten during
times of war. The viola-</p>

tion of these rules is more in evidence during a bigger war than a
sma- ller one. For it is said that it is during a crisis that a manâs
character is put to the test. It cannot be claimed that he has been
put to the test until he has had the chance successfully of
committing a crime but remains steadfast in spite of the opportunity.
Such steadfastness at a critical time may be found in a handful of
men. It is indeed all too rare.</p>

The bigger the war, the bigger the extent of chaos. The fraud and
trickery, that were exposed during the Crimean War<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, and other sundry happenings that have later come to
light, are most distressing. During that war, a large stock of boots
was purchased and despatched to the front for the use of soldiers,
but they all were found to be for the left foot! A large quantity of
foodstuff for the army was sent from England; but when it was
consumed, instead of helping to feed the army, it proved deleterious
being very rotten meat. It was not only merchants who wanted to
become millionaires, but even the generals on the front, the
politicians who were out to sacrifice a large number of precious
lives, and leaders who called themselves benefactors of the state,
committed fraud. Large stock of useful medicines sent out for
soldiers and officers on their deathbed disappeared mysteriously
before reaching the hospitals for which they were bound, and not a
trace of them was found. Merchants, the so-called patriotic generals
and high Government officials thus went on misappropriating hun-
dreds of useful and valuable articles to fill their pockets at the
expense of hundreds of poor soldiers who had gone to the front to
fight for their country, leaving their homes and hearths. When a news
corres- pondent sent a full account of this, describing the condition
of the army encamped at Sebastapol, the whole nation was so enraged
that the ministry in power had to resign. In addition to this, there
was a long list of oppressive tyrannies. But all these are
insignificant inci- dents compared to those of the last Boer War. A
scrutiny of how con- tracts, for the supply of provisions, uniforms,
etc., to the army, were given and executed during that was has
revealed how public money was utterly wasted. This was due solely to
the misconduct of the auto- cratic officials. Contracts were blindly
given by the departments conc- erned to contractors who were their
favourites or were known to them and who made a profit of 50 to 500
per cent on some of the goods</p>

supplied. Such corruption was not confined to Great Britain alone.
The defeat France sustained in 1879 was due to its officers who had
become slaves of mammon. For, at the time of that war, the French
Government had kept every necessary article ready. Millions and bil-
lions had been spent on these arrangements at the very start, but all
that expenditure was incurred secretly. All these things was
purchased and storedâon paper only. Although money was spent like
water, articles of even ordinary military use ran short at the very
outset of the war. The reports of the present Russo-Japanese War,
too, are astoun- ding. Last April, a million roubles were given to
Duke of Sergius to be spent on feeding and clothing the army in
Manchuria. This stock was despatched to Manchuria in the month of
May; but, instead of reac- hing there, it got transported directly
from Moscow to Danzig, and from thence, goods worth thousands of
pounds were sold for a song in Germany. Large sums of money were
raised through subscriptions for the benefit of the widows of men and
officers killed in the war; but not a farthing of that money reached
the poor widows. The bags of suger despatched to the battle-field
were found to contain sand instead of sugar! No trace could be found
of millions of roubles that disap- peared during the construction of
the Trans-Siberian Railway. But this is not all. Innumerable examples
have been recorded of the corru- ption and bribery practised in
Russia.</p>

The conduct of the Japanese affords a marked contrast to all this. No
merchant or officer in Japan has entertained any thought of
exploiting the war situation, with the result that the Japanese army
can secure its needs at a very small cost. The report of the Butler
Commis- sion on the war in South Africa, which has been published,
tells us that the irregularities and corruption that prevailed during
that war were in no way less [considerable] than in Russia. The way
public money has been spent is very much to be deplored. A major part
of this waste was due to incompetent officers, who were inexperienced
and untrained. The Commission recommends that the officers deserve to
be censured for such serious lapses. The countryâs wealth that was
collected thro- ugh heavy taxation was abused without limit, and the
officers suppo- sed to be responsible for it connived at it. This has
cast a slur on the British administration, which has so for enjoyed a
reputation for jus- tice and integrity in public affairs. There was
no limit to the chaos, corruption and dishonesty rampant at the time.

By this time you must be deeply engaged in your mission in England. I
have no doubt that you will have a corner in your heart for the
British Indians in South Africa. Is it possible for you, on your
return to India, to pass through South Africa? If you could do so,
and if you would kindly let me have previous notice, suitable
arrange- ments would be made for your stay in the different parts of
the country. I suggest your giving one month to South Africa. If you
could come, the expenses of your tour in South Africa would be borne
by the community. You could land in Cape Town, pass through
Kimberley, Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and Pretoria; go to Natal and
see Durban, Pietermaritzburg, thence to Delagoa Bay, and  thence
either by the East Coast visiting Mosambique, Zanzibar, Lamu and
Mombasa, or go via Ceylon and take in Mauritius on your way.</p>

	There is a complaint against you both that you spend most of your
	time on Sundays playing cards, that you are not courteous to your
	customers and do not take sufficient care of your masterâs
	business. I do not believe much of this. If you are fond of playing
	cards, I personally do not wish to prohibit you. I believe you do

	convey to you what has come to my ears rather than keep it to

	do so for a short while only. You know Rustomjee Shethâs nature.

	I trush you will allow me to trespass on your courtesy to enable me
	to reply to certain statements made by your correspondent at Potc-
	hefstroom with reference to a letter I wrote to you on Mr. Lovedayâs
	statements at the Inter-Colonial Council meeting. Your correspondent
	states that I âregretted the continued stream of Indians,
	particularly those of the lower classâ. I am not aware of having
	ever expressed any such regret for the simple reason that I have
	never believed in a continued stream of Indians pouring into
	Potchefstroom or elsewhere.  I speak with certain knowledge when I
	deny any such influx at all. That there has been some increase in
	the number of Indian traders in Potchefstroom, as well as in other
	places, is not to be denied, but the increase in the number of white
	traders is out of all proportion to the increase in the number of
	Indian traders. In your leaderette on the Krugersdrop meeting, you
	say that âPietersburg has  undoubtedly been one of the favourite
	places to which the Asiatic traders have gravitated of lateâ. This
	has been shown to be wrong. The fact is that</p>

but there has been no great influx since.</p>

In this connection, may I say that the British Indian community in
the Transvaal has never received sufficient credit for the spirit of
conciliation and compromise it has throughout shown. Whilst all kinds
of impossible remedies are being suggested, the only two infallible
tests proposed by the British Indian Association still remain
untried. In order to prevent any possibility of the Indians
âinvadingâ the cou- ntry, an Immigration Restrictions Act on the
Cape model has been suggested. The Act has been tried not only there,
but in Australia, Natal and elsewhere, and has not been found
wanting. It is useless to say that there cannot be strict watch on
the border. Natal has suc- ceeded in keeping that watch. Many an
Indian has found out to his cost that he cannot enter Natal
territories through Charlestown or any other inland stations, unless
he can prove that he is entitled to enter the Colony under the
Immigration Act. To prove that the Indians do not in any way mean to
usurp the European trade, they accept municipal control over the
licences, in such a manner that any Municipality will have the power
either to refuse or to grant a licence to trade, subject in extreme
cases to revision by the Supreme Court. It is true that such
legislation will not be class legislation, and will be of general
appli- cation. Does it, however, matter? It can be passed without any
bother, if all parties agree upon the main principles, and it will
set at rest the unhealthy agitation against the Asiatics that springs
up in the Colony from time to time, and settle the minds of the
Indians. There is no finality to any legislation under a progressive
Government. If, there- fore, the two measures above mentioned are, in
practice, found not to answer, it will be time to consider what more
is necessary.`</p>

The Indians need not accept any such compromise, especially in view
of Mr. Lytteltonâs emphatic declaration that nothing that they
enjoyed before the war would be taken away from them. They certa-
inly enjoyed the rights of free immigration and free trading, and it
is exactly [on] these two points that they have offered the above
compr- omise; if only the very un-British Law 3 of 1885, and other
harsh and needless regulations, which have nothing to do with the
economic conditions, be removed from the Statute-book. Mr. Brodrick
has only lately stated that British trade with India is greater than
that with Aust- ralia, Canada and South Africa put together, and
that, therefore, Impe- rially considered, India occupies a place
second only to Great Britain. Will the Colonists continue to subject
the inhabitants of that country to constant pin-pricks?</p>

of retaliation. It is not possible, then, to realise what India could
do if retaliation were seriously taken up? China and America are not
under the same flag, whereas South Africa and India are. Would it not
be a calamity if there arise permanent estrangement between the local
Governments in South Africa and the Indian Government, and if Lord
Curzon carries out his threat deliberately uttered in the Imperial
Legislative Council at Calcutta? Some such thing is inevitable unless
the Colonists see the sweet reasonableness of the compromise above
offered.</p>

Perhaps you will allow me to make a few remarks on your lead- ing
article in the <i>Daily Mail </i>of the 26th instant anent the
Krugersdorp anti-Asiatic meeting.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.28cm; line-height: 95%">
After admitting that pledges were given before the war by the Home
Government regarding the British Indians, you go on to advise them
that âthey must admit that their competition has driven out many
white tradersâ. With all due respect, I venture to think that you
are advising the Indian community to admit what does  not  exist.
There has not yet been given, at any of these meetings, one authentic
instance of the white trader having been driven out by Indian compet-
ition. This can only be proved by the appointment of a commission to
investigate the charge. In the meanwhile, the presumption is wholly
in favour of the Indian contention that Indian competition has not 
âruined white tradeâ, or âdriven outâ any such traders. In
the Trans- vaal itself, as well before the war as now, the white
traders have held their own. At the Cape, in spite of the greatest
freedom of trade gran- ted to Asiatics, the white trader is largely
predominant. In Natal, where there is the largest Indian population,
Sir James Hullett only the other day said, in his evidence on oath,
that the Indian traders had not serio- usly affected the white
traders. I submit that this competition has been quite healthy, in
that it has kept down the prices of the necessaries of</p>

life. I am free to admit that the Indian scores by his simplicity of
life, but this is more than counterbalanced by the white traderâs
knowledge of the English language his superior organising ability,
and better facilities for making connections with wholesale houses in
Europe.</p>

But, Sir, the Indians are prepared to concede all that can reason-
ably be expected of them, without having to make the admission you
advise them to make. They are prepared, in place of Law 3 of 1885 and
other unnecessarily stringent regulations, to accept municipal
control over the licences in general, whereby the local bodies will
have the right either to grant or to refuse licences, subject, in
special cases, to revision by the Supreme Court.</p>

Their trading rights are the greatest cause of irritation, and this
can be allayed without the slightest difficulty, and without loss of
time, by accepting the compromise above suggested.</p>

You seem to think that the Indians now here âhave  certain moral
claims which will have to be dealt with by fresh legislationâ. This
is not in accord with facts. They have a moral claim, certainly, to
be placed on an equality with the Europeans, so far as the rights of
trade, ownership of property and locomotion are concerned, but they
have, today, a legal right to trade and live where they like, as has
been laid down by the Supreme Court, and it is not capable of being
restric- tively dealt with by fresh legislation, as has been said,
both by Mr. Lyttelton and Mr. Brodrick; and yet, in order to
conciliate public opinion, the Indian community is prepared to accept
a restriction on trade, on general and non-racial lines, under the
proviso above men- tioned.</p>

The other claims have not yet been received. Suramsamyâs Power of
Attorney I have not yet been able to trace, nor Verasamyâs. Vandi-
thumuâs Power of Attorney has been sent to the Commission, but they
are not able to trace this claim. Can you say how much the man rec-

I notice in the Natal <i>Government Gazette </i>received to-day a
Bill to amend the Immigration Act of 1903. This ought to appear in
this weekâs <i>Opinion, </i>but I am afraid that it will not. I
think that it is your clear duty to see the <i>Gazette </i>the day it
is received by you, and send anything that may be therein of
importance to Phoenix. It does not look at all nice that Natal
matters should appear a fortnight after they happen. Have you also
borne it in mind that we have to send a mem- orial to the [Colonial<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>] Secretary as soon as the several Bills, about which we
[have] petitioned, become Acts, or are accepted in their final
[stages by] the Legislative Council? For that infor[mation I must
rely] upon you entirely.</p>

objectionable. The first is to amend the laws relating to liquor
licences and other licences in their application to the province of
Zulu land. In this Bill, which is very largely aimed at British
Indians, a hawker is to be called upon to take out a licence from
month to month, and this applies even to hawkers in goods not
imported, although for the latter</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
there is no licensing fee required. The fee for a hawkerâs licence
to trade in imported goods is to be Â£l per month. Moreover, licences
under Act 18 of 1897 are not to be granted unless with the approval
of the Colonial Secretary, whose decision is to be absolutely final,
and âfrom whose decision there shall be no appeal to any court of
law or authorityâ.</p>

Another Bill dealing with British Indians is the one to impose a tax
upon unoccupied rural lands. This is a reproduction of the Bill with
which we have already dealt<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and in which land is to be deemed unoccupied unless the
owner or some European has continuously resided thereon for at least
nine of the twelve months reckoned from January to December in each
year.</p>

The third Bill is the one to provide for the licensing of private
Locations. A private Location is defined therein to  mean  âany
number of huts or dwellings occupied by Natives or Asiatics on any
private lands or any piece of Crown land in process of alienationâ.
Thus, by a stroke of the pen, every piece of ground which may be
occupied by Indians is to be turned into a private Location, and the
landlord of the place on which the private Location is established is
to take out a licence in respect of which he has to pay 10/-<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>per year per hut or dwelling. Licence fee is not to be
paid in respect of any huts occupied by Asiatics or Native employees.
The net result of this would be that every room occupied by an
Indian, unless he is the owner or in the employ of the owner, shall
be liable to an annual tax of 10/-, to say nothing of the insult
which is implied in calling the Asiaticsâ habitations âLocationsâ.</p>

The fourth Bill is to impose a tax on occupied dwelling-houses. This
is of general application, and probably the framers of the Bill had
not in their minds British Indians at all; but in the end the Bill
will tell far more heavily against Indians than any other class of
the community. The Bill contemplates the levy of a tax of Â£1-10 on
every house valued at under Â£750. The tax rises to Â£20 for a
dwelling-house</p>

exceeding Â£4,000 in value, and the word âdwelling-houseâ means a
house or a part of a house used as a dwelling and including
domesticservantsâ quarters, stables, out-buildings and other
buildings forming the adjuncts of a dwelling-house, in so far as they
serve the residential purposes of the house, and this tax has to be
paid not by the owners, but by the occupier. Therefore, every
occupier of a room even if it is worth only Â£50 will have to pay an
annual tax of Â£ l-10. There are many rooms which are made of wood
and iron for which, probably, only five shillings per month is paid.
The Government proposes to add a monthly half-a-crown to such rental.
To say the least of it, there should have been some free limit under
which the tax should not be levied. As it is, the Bill is open to
very serious objection. These Bills are a sample of the activity of
the new ministry.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>We
feel constrained to say that the stamp of inexperience is to be seen
on every one of them. Every true citizen must sympathise with the
Government in their efforts to bring the Colony out of its difficult
pecuniary position; but the means adopted by them to raise revenue
are almost without precedent in modern times, except during war time,
and are opposed to sound economic principles. We hope that, for the
sake of the fair name and fame of the Colony, these Bills will
receive short shrift at the hands of the Assembly and the Council.</p>

Sir Mancherji<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3 </font></sup>has
drawn from Mr. Brodrick an important reply on the status of British
Indians in the Transvaal. The member for Bethnal Green pressed for
some solution of the Indian question, and Mr. Brodrick has stated
emphatically that nothing of what the Indians enjoyed before the war
would be taken away from them; that every pressure that could be
brought to bear on the Transvaal was being brought, but that it was
difficult to interfere with a self-governing Colony dealing with the
immigration of such people as it may consider to be undesirable. The

can only mean that it is the intention of the Imperial Government to
see that Indians are not deprived of such rights as they may have
enjoyed during the Boer regime. Such intention is not at present
being carried out. To take only one instance: there was no
restriction on the immigration of British Indians. At present, as
these columns have shown repeatedly, no new Indians are being allowed
to enter Transvaal territory, and the old residents are only allowed
to enter in small numbers, and after they have undergone tedious,
inconvenient and expensive formalities. That pressure is being
brought by the Imperial we know and appreciate. We question, however,
whether the pressure  is commensurate with the gravity of the
situation. For the third statement made by the Right Honourable
Gentleman gives rise to many a misgiving. It betrays a feeling of
helplessness. The Transvaal is not yet a self-governing Colony,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>but, by implication, Mr. Brodrick has considered it as
such. Mr. Brodrick does not deny the promises referred to by Sir
Mancherji; nor can it be denied that, when the promises were made,
the responsible ministers knew what was coming. They knew that there
was to be only one conclusion to the war, and that after the
declaration of peace self-government was  bound  to come. It,
therefore, means that the Home Government are now prepared, in their
eagerness to conciliate the Transvaal European opinion, even to
recede from their promises. It is apposite here to inquire why, so
soon as peace was declared, the promises made to the Indians were not
immediately fulfilled; also, why, even now, as suggested by Sir
William Wedderburn<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>,
so long as the Transvaal has not received actual self-government, the
Home Government do not repeal the old restrictions on the British
Indians, and thus throw on the Council that would be elected, under
complete self-government, the onus of repealing such legislation and
proving the necessity for it.</p>

About the same time that Mr. Brodrick made the above statement, in a
different place, but still as Secretary of State for India, he
informed his audience that India had the first claim on their
consideration, next only to Great Britain itself, in that the trade
of Great Britain with India was larger than that done with Canada,

Indians in the Transvaal been considered in such a spirit on the
conclusion of war, when Lord Milner<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>put his pen through scores of old Transvaal Ordinances
which were not consistent with British principles, he would not have
hesitated to do likewise in connection with the anti-Indian
legislation. Nor was it a matter of oversight; for immediately the
country was opened up, British Indians approached Lord Milner for a
cancellation of the anti-Indian laws. If that step had been taken,
nothing would have been heard, probably, of anti Indian agitation
to-day; nor, in our opinion, is it yet too late to put into practice
the theory propounded by Mr. Brodrick.</p>

In view of what we have already said with reference to Mr. Brodrickâs
statement,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3 </font></sup>it
is interesting to examine the definition of self-government given by
Lord Selborne to a deputation that waited on him last week in the
Orange River Colony, in order to request the grant of self-government
to that Colony. His Excellency has thus defined that</p>

the British Empire responsible government means, in strictly local
affairs, absolute independence; it means absolute local independence
so long as that independence does not encroach on the general harmony
of the British Empire, or infringe any of those principles on which
it is founded, or any of those imperial considerations which bind it
together.</font></font></p>

the King Emperor, and it is in accord with the professions repeatedly
made by the Imperial Colonial Secretaries. The question, then, is
whether the disabilities which British Indians suffer in the
Transvaal do not encroach on the general harmony of the British
Empire, or infringe any of those Imperial considerations which bind
it together. The question is self answered. Let us hope that His
Excellency, when he is called upon to deal with the Indian question,
will apply the definition given by him, and remove the present
anomaly.</p>

Lord Curzon<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>has
frequently declared that, in making public appointments, he made no
discrimination between the white and the Coloured. On one occasion,
he burst out with vehemence saying that Indians had no reason to
complain in the matter of appointments. Moreover, he published a
statement with figures to prove that quite a number of appointments
were given to Indians. But the statement was misleading, for he had
cleverly included in it many Indians drawing a salary of Rs. 75. The
Hon. Mr. Gokhale<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>has
exposed this hollow pretence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3

almost all Europeans and that all the newly created posts have gone
to them.</p>

A comparison can be made, up to a point, between the people of Russia
and our own. Just as we are poor, the Russian people are also poor.
We have no voice in conducting the affairs of State and have to pay
taxes without demur; the same is true of the Russians also. Seeing
such oppression, some Russians do come out bravely against it from
time to time. Some time ago, there was a rebellion in Russia and one
of the chief participants was Maxim Gorky. This man was brought up in
extreme poverty. At first he served as an apprentice to a shoe-
maker, who discharged him. Afterwards he served as a soldier for some
time. While in the army, he evinced a desire for education, but being
poor could not get himself admitted to any good school. He then
served under a lawyer and finally worked as a hawker at  a  bakerâs.
All this time he continued educating himself through his own efforts.
The very first book he wrote in 1892 was so excellent that he soon
became famous. Thereafter, he wrote many things, all of them with a
single purpose, viz., to stir up the people against the tyrannies
they were labouring under, to warn the authorities and  to  render
public service, in so far as this was possible. Without caring to

Singapore can be said to be as near to the Chinese as it is to us. In
that Colony an Indian has all the facilities a Chinese has. Despite
this, our people there cannot hold their own against the  Chinese. 
Many Chinese are in Government service, in the Public Works
Department or are contractors, and are all very well off. Some even
own motor cars. The number of Chinese who entered Singapore territory
was 200,947 in 1900, 178,778 in 1901, 207,l56 in 1902 and 220,321 in
1903; while the number of Indians who migrated there was 21,000 a
year, most of them from Madras. This shows how much is yet to be
achieved by our people in the matter of emigration to, and settling
in, foreign territories. It is a shame that we cannot keep abreast of
the Chinese.</p>

sanctioned by His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony,
regarding Coloured persons. My Association ventures to draw His
Excellencyâs attention to the fact that no fresh legislation has
been asked for in my letter. In the humble opinion of my Association,
the powers already possessed by the Lieutenant-Governor enable him to
veto bye-laws which are contrary to British traditions and  to  the
Letters Patent. My Association is informed that such legislation as
the municipalities have been allowed to pass would have to be
reserved for His Majestyâs assent, if it were passed by the
Legislative Council. My Association also ventures to think that the
last paragraph of the letter, written by the Acting Colonial
Secretary, is a complete justification for the complaint made by my
Association, for, if the question raised is of no practical
importance as there are so few British Indians, it cannot be of
practical importance to pass legislation of the character referred to
in my communication. While it is of no use in the Colony, it  wounds,
unnecessarily, the feelings of the British Indian community in South
Africa, and my Association, therefore, ventures to trust that His
Excellency will be graciously pleased to inquire into the bye-laws
that have been passed and sanctioned for the various municipalities
in the Orange River Colony, and grant the necessary relief.</p>

	We publish two important communications in this issue on the status
	of British Indians in the Orange River Colony. The one is a short
	and belated reply from the Colonial Secretary of that Colony to the
	protest of the British Indian Association at Johannesburg, against
	the anti-Asiatic municipal legislation that has been sanctioned by
	the Lieutenant-Governor from time to time by the municipalities of
	the Orange River Colony. The second letter is from Mr H. R.
	Fox-Bourne the Secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society,
	addressed to Mr. Lyttelton.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
	</font></sup>The two communications are a contrast The Colonial
	Secretary writes saying that the Government are not contemplating
	any legislation with a view to restricting the powers of  local
	government at present enjoyed by municipalities in the Orange River
	Colony. This , in our opinion, is purely begging the question. The
	British Indian Association has never asked for any  legislation  to
	restrict the powers, because the veto is already [vested] in the
	Lieutenant-Governor. No bye-laws are of any force unless sanctioned
	by the Lieutenant-Governor, and we know of no statute, even for the
	Orange River Colony, which compels the Lieutenant-Governor to
	sanction any bye-laws that the municipalities may pass. On  the
	contrary, the instructions issued to His Excellency are that he is
	not tosanction any colour legislation; and one would suppose that,
	if he may not do that in respect of laws applying to the whole of
	the  Colony, he cannot also do so in respect of laws  applying  to 
	a particular municipality in that Colony. The reason given by the
	Colonial Secretary is sarcastic. He says: âAs there are so few
	British Indians in the Colony, I think you will agree that the
	question raised by you is not of great <i>practical </i>importanceâ.
	The word practical is underlined in the letter. What is the meaning?

gates of the Orange River Colony are for ever to  remain barred
against the British Indian, and also that, if he ever entered the
Colony, he would do so in the face of all the restrictive powers, and
if he protests, he would be told that such laws could not be
repealed. âToo lateâ will be flung in his face. May we not ask
the Colonial Secretary why, as there are so few British Indians in
the Orange River Colony, the wanton insult is offered at all? Is it
practical statesmanship to wound the feelings of a whole nation, even
when there is not an iota of justification for it? Surely the
municipalities of the Orange River Colony could not be so
unreasonable as not to listen to expostulations from the
Lieutenant-Governor on a matter which, on the Colonial Secretaryâs
own showing, is of no importance to them, unless they delight in
heaping unnecessary insults on a community which has never done them
any harm. But we would not pursue the examination of the letter any
further. We are glad that the-British Indian Association has already
moved in the matter, and  approached  the High Commissioner.</p>

In pleasant contrast to the letter we find Mr. Fox-Bourneâs
communication to the Colonial Secretary. We invite the attention of
all South African Imperialists to this important communication, which
we have copied from our contemporary, <i>India. </i>Much has been
often said in South Africa against the Aborigines Protection Society.
We hope, however, that the South African Press and South African
readers will treat each act on its own merits, and not condemn, by
reason of pre- conceived prejudice, anything that may emanate from
the Aborigines Protection Society, which, after all, counts among its
members some of the noblest of Britons. Mr. Fox-Bourne has also
assurances to be fulfilled in this matter. He has reminded the
Colonial Secretary that, before the war, in reply to his Societyâs
representations, certain promises were given. He, therefore,
âventures to hope that no time will be lost in fulfilling those
assurancesâ, and he is âencouraged in the hope, at any rate as
regarding Coloured persons who are British subjects and not
uncivilised, by remarks made by Lord Milnerâ. The Imperial
Government have a hard nut to crack. They have either to adopt the
advice of Sir Arthur Lawley<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and boldly commit a breach of their promises, or to
fulfil them in accordance with British traditions.</p>

A deputation on behalf of whites from the Transvaal mines waited upon
Lord Selborne on July l, and prayed for protection for the whites
against Chinese labourers. It stated that the whites did not behave
badly towards the Chinese; that, since thirty or forty Chinese worked
under a white supervisor, it was not difficult for the Chinese to
take his life in the event of a riot; that the Chinese frequently
insulted their white boss by using foul language and making indecent
gestures; and that the language they used was so foul that it was
impossible for the deputation to reproduce it. They said that a white
man would not take such an insult lying down. In his reply, Lord
Selborne said that there had been only twenty cases of assault by the
Chinese until then, though the Chinese labour numbered 40,000; that
their complaint about the language was without substance, for the
white himself used abusive language and set a bad example. It was
harmful to the whites themselves to indulge in drink and indecent
behaviour in the presence of the Chinese. If one uses abusive words
while addressing persons utterly ignorant of the language, they pick
them up parrot-like, and it is then very difficult to mend matters.
Moreover, he said, the whiteness of the whites should not be limited
to their skin only but should permeate within also, that is, they
should have the art of inducing respect, obedience and awe in others
by their own exemplary conduct. Then only could they be called white
in reality. In brief, he held the whites themselves responsible for
the ugly behaviour of the Chinese, and indicated the need of winning
the Chinese over by their own good behaviour. Several other
difficulties also were placed by the deputationists before Lord
Selborne, who promised to give adequate attention to them.</p>

The tax levied on salt in India has always been a subject of
criticism. This time it has been criticised by the well-known Dr.
Hutchinson, who says that it is a great shame for the British
Government in India to continue it, while a similar tax previously in
force in Japan has been abolished. The tax should be immediately</p>

abolished. Salt is an essential article in our dietary. It could be
said that to a certain extent, the increasing incidence of leprosy in
India was due to the salt tax. Dr. Hutchinson considers the salt tax
a barbarous practice, which ill becomes the British Government.</p>

	On behalf of my Association, I am respectfully to protest against
	clause 3 of the draft Ordinance to âgenerally amend the Municipal
	statutesâ of the Colony, as published in a supplement to the
	<i>Government Gazette </i>dated the 7th inst.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.31cm; line-height: 102%">
	My Association ventures to submit that the giving of the control of
	Asiatic Bazaars to the Town Councils is premature and calculated to
	prejudice the status of British Indians in the Colony in view of the
	fact that the whole question of anti-Asiatic legislation is now
	under consideration by the local Government as also by the Imperial
	Government. Law 3 of l885 contemplates government control, and
	seeing that the municipalities in the Transvaal are swayed very
	largely by colour prejudice, my Association humbly thinks that it
	would be an injustice to British Indians to give over control of
	Asiatic Bazaars to the municipalities or local boards.</p>

	My Association, therefore, trusts that the Government will be
	pleased to withdraw the clause in question, and allow the matter to
	remain in abeyance until the whole question of the status of British</p>

I regret that I have only just broken the back of the document left
by you with me for translation. There are still 24 closely written
sides to be translated. I need hardly say that this will be a most
expensive translation. The amount of work already put in is over Â£2,
and by the time I have finished, it will be quite Â£l2. However, from
what I have already read, it appears that my agents at Porbandar had
to go by a most circuitous route to get a certified copy, the reason
being the changes of the law which prevent any but the interested
parties within the jurisdiction of the court getting certified
copies. However, if you wish me to continue the translation, I will
do so, and it will take me quite a week before I can let you have the
whole of it, as under my present engagements it would not be possible
for me to devote two full days to it, which is the necessary time for
the work. I am in a position to devote only a little time from day to
day.</p>

	travelling on the new tram-cars, my client will refrain from testing
	his right in a law court, but if it cannot, it appears very
	advisable that the issue should be definitely decided now. My
	personal experience has been that, where an absence of certain
	rights has been assumed without reason, rearrangement has, as a
	rule, proceeded upon such assumption, and what was once an open
	question has upon rearrangement been  definitely decided against the
	granting of such right or rights. I venture, therefore, to think
	that the proposal above made is quite reasonable.</p>

We publish in another column the text of a letter received by the
Chairman of the British Indian League at Cape Town from the Colonial
Secretaryâs Office, in reply to representations of the League on
the working of the Cape Immigration Act. The Colonial Secretary
brushes asidein a single sentence the request made by the League as
to the recognition of the Indian languages. We hope that the British
Indian League will not leave the question at that. With reference to
the interpretation of the term âdomicileâ, the reply is most
unsatisfactory. It is not every Indian who can show possession of
immovable property, or presence of wife and children in the Colony.
If such an interpretation is insisted upon, it cannot but cause
unnecessary hardship, in spite of the intention of the Colonial
Secretary not to do so. A man may leave his business at the Cape, pay
 a temporary visit to India, and find himself for ever shut out of
the Cape, because his wife and children are not in the Colony, or he
does not own immovable property. It would then simply mean ruin to
the poor store-keeper who, under a false sense of security, may have
gone to India, leaving his business in temporary charge of his
manager. Nor is this illustration an imaginary one, for we understand
that cases of such Indians having been refused re-entrance have
actually happened. The least, therefore, that Colonel Crewe<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>could do to satisfy the requirements of justice is to
recognise the rights of those who may have left business or
employment in the country to re-enter. It will then be possible for
them to talk of an exercise of leniency, for, in the definition given
by him, so far there has been no leniency but a very strict
application of the law; and then only will it be possible for the
British Indian League to recognise the reasonable attitude of the
Government. For the present, we think, with the greatest deference,
that it is unjust, unreasonable and calculated to impose very serious
hardship on the British Indians residing in the Cape Colony.</p>

Mr. Wacha, the genial Joint Secretary of the National Congress, has
written to us a letter which is full of encouragement, hope and
suggestion. We reproduce the main portion of it in another column. He
has given a parallel case which is of some importance in the
controversy that is going on in South Africa over the status of
British Indians. âThe settlers,â says Mr. Wacha,</p>

your side, seem to have forgotten how merchants and traders
themselves used to complain in the bitterest terms of the East India
Co., which, up till the Act of 1833, interdicted them from trading in
India. Those who came were styled âinterlopersâ, but the
interlopers were persevering and earnest,</font></font></p>

and we know that they succeeded. Earnestness and perseverance are
also the keynote to the situation in South Africa. We have far
greater justice on our side than they of 1833. British Indians have a
threefold right to have their status made good in South Africa. The
Proclamation of 1858, no matter what may be said to the contrary,
guarantees them full British subject rights. They have shown
themselves to be industrious, sober, law-abiding and honest in South
Africa, and, as has been often admitted, they have been very useful
in developing its resources. They have also had promises of fair and
equal treatment, especially regarding their civil rights in South
Africa, from responsible ministers.</p>

Popular feeling is growing against the House Tax Bill published in
the Natal <i>Government Gazette. </i>A public meeting was held on the
night of the 10th instant in Maritzburg to consider the Bill, and a
meeting was also held in Durban on Thursday evening. A large  number

objectionable even if passed as a temporary measure. If introduced,
this tax would be regarded more equitable than the poll-tax as a
permanent levy. The poll-tax cannot be tolerated for ever, though it
is true that it is levied in some countries. In view of the public
feeling against the house tax, it should either be modified or
droppedaltogether, so that the feeling against the poll-tax may not
be intensified.</p>

The Japanese have captured the Southelian Island from the Russians
and landed their troops there. This island is 670 miles long, and 20
to 150 miles broad. Its area is 24,550 square miles, that is, more
extensive than that of Kathiawad. The southern part of the island was
in the possession of Japan till the year l875, but was later passed
on to Russia in exchange for the Kuril Islands.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>In that island, there are many kerosene wells, and coal
also is found in abundance. The negotiations for peace now in
progress have been very greatly influenced by the capture of such a
big island by Japan. The Times says that no other event during the
war has hit the  Russians  so severely. This event has proved that
Russia is quite incapable of defending her boundaries. It is not yet
fifty years  since  this islandcame into the hands of the Russians.
She had taken possession of it through political machinations and
Japan had to suffer a lot on that account. But for this great war,
the island would have continued to be in Russian hands. Japan had had
her eye on the island for a long time, and it is believed that this
timely victory will strengthen the Japanese position in the peace
negotiations at Washington. By the time the Peace Committee is in
session, we might possibly hear of Marshal Oyama having dealt a
severe blow to the Russian General, Linewich. The Japanese army
declines to suspend hostilities for a short spell of truce, but
intends to wage furious war and force Russia  into concluding a
lasting peace. And they will show that there is no</p>

	Sheth Haji Ismail<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>.
	I do not at all like the way he has written them. I can see from it

	consider what is to be done about it.</p>

I have received a letter from Omar Sheth in which he says that this
expenditure is too much. I have also read your last two letters. I
think they lack in the requisite courtesy. Omar Sheth is your uncle;
therefore the letters from your end should be full of courtesy as
only befits your noble family.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 95%"><a name="313. LETTER TO âTHE DAILY EXPRESSâ"></a>
What Omar Sheth says about expenses deserves to be carefully
considered. There is a world of difference between the time when Omar
Sheth visited England and the present. The rents have gone down by
half and will go down still further. The expenses here are met from
the rents received, so that the time has come when you have to live
on capital. I think your estate is such that it should never be
necessary for you to live on your capital. Even millionaires who fell
back on their capital have run through it. My earnest advice to you,
therefore, is that you should be very careful in spending money on
your household. I believe some of the expenditure can be reduced.
Please take good care of your health. Exercise and regulated diet are
the essential things.</p>

Indians through your columns in your issue of the 17th instant. There
is a homely Indian saying that you can take a horse to a watercourse
but cannot compel him to drink the water. So also those who shut
their eyes to facts placed before them are not to be disabused of
their misconceptions. Your correspondent, I very much fear, belongs
to that category. For his information, however, I ask again the
question, if there were only thirteen Indian (not âcoolieâ, as
your correspondent would have it) âstore-keepers, traders and
hawkersâ before the war, how is it that the challenge issued by the
Chairman of the British Indian Association has not been taken up by
Mr. Kleinenberg<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>?
Remember that the names of these store-keepers have been supplied to
the Press. I note that your correspondent has gone one better, in
that he makes bold to say that the number thirteen includes
store-keepers, traders and hawkers. Unfortunately for him, he has
chosen a fatal number, and I am prepared to deposit with you the sum
of Â£100 to be forfeited to any anti-Indian Association your
correspondent may name if I fail to prove to the satisfaction of two
arbitrators, one to be chosen by him and the other by me, with power
to them to appoint an umpire, that there were more than twice the
number of store-keepers, traders and hawkers mentioned by your
correspondent prior to the war in the town of Pietersburg; provided
that he forfeits to the British Indian Association an equal sum in
the event of the award being in my favour. So much for Sinkramsamâs
figures.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.39cm">As
to the  charge   that   the   Native  is  being  fleeced  by British</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
Indians, I can only refer your correspondent to Sir James Hulettâs
testimony<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>bet
fore the Native Affairs Commission as to which is the greater
evil-doer, the European or the Indian. With reference to the other
charges made by your correspondent, and based on âinformationâ
supplied to him, I can only say that sensible people will rate them
at their true value. If there is any nefarious trade done by Indians,
and he has received the information, surely the remedy is in his own
hands, and if the question of trading licences is not yet settled
once and for all, it is because Sinkramsam and his coadjutors would
not accept the very reasonable compromise  suggested  by British
Indians, whereby the control of new licences would be handed to the
Town Councillors to be elected largely by Sinkramsam and his friends.
You, Sir, have some experience of the British Indian question as it
was prior to the war. You have experience of British Indians also.
You have adopted an independent attitude in journalism. I am sure</p>

Your letter to hand. In my opinion, we are all bound to honour and
welcome any learned Indian who happens to come here. We have nothing
to do with his religious preaching. Both Hindus and Mahomedans should
join in honouring him. I, therefore, regard it our duty to honour
Prof. Parmanand<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
As to his religious teachings, thosewho are his associates in those
teachings might do whatever they like later on. I, therefore, think
that you should not refrain from honouring him. I have not given my
consent to the collection of subscriptions, etc., nor do I intend to
do so.</p>

Hindu teaching, and a complaint has been forwarded to me from the
latter. We owe respect to any cultured Indian who may arrive from
India, and I would rather you gave a suitable reception from Indians

There are features in the Budget statement made by  the Secretary of
State for India to the House of Commons on the motion that the House
should go into committee on the East India Revenue accounts. It is a
happy augury that Mr. Brodrick has presented his statement almost for
the first time, within recent times, during the middle of the session
instead of, as usual, at the end, when the Indian Secretary goes
through the farce of addressing empty benches. The departure, too,
has been deliberate. âDiscussion,â said Mr. Brodrick, âat this
earlier period is more likely to lead to useful criticism and
efficient administrationâ. He hoped, too, that the precedent would
be followed, whether in future he was the holder of the high office
or an honourable member from the Opposition benches. Mr. Brodrick
took occasion to show most clearly the extent of the services
rendered to the Empire by much-maligned India, and both the services
he laid so much stress upon are such as to command attention and
appreciation in South Africa.</p>

seventy-five thousand British troops and a breeding ground for one
hundred and forty thousand British Indian troops which are held at
the disposal of the Empire in any emergency. The whole cost is borne
by India, representing an expense of twenty-and-a-half millions out
of a revenue of eighty-two millions. Distinguished generals from Lord
Roberts downwards have testified to the efficacy of the services of
the Indian Army. Sir George White and his army gave a striking
illustration of this preparedness during the Boer War. These are all
facts pregnant with meaning. They ought to be studied and pondered by
South African politicians; and, after they have done so, we
respectfully suggest to them that they should ask themselves the
question whether it would pay, even from a purely selfish standpoint,
to continuously treat the inhabitants of India as complete aliens
undeserving of any consideration whatsoever at their hands.</p>

in protesting against the contemplated transfer of the control of the
Bazaars to the municipalities.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>The objections to such transference are, in our opinion,
unanswerable. The whole of the Asiatic question is still pending, and
is the subject of correspondence between the Imperial Government and
the local Government. Law 3 of 1885, as both the Parties have stated,
is only a stopgap to be swept away as soon as possible. Any
legislation, therefore, based on that law and amplifying the
restrictions is inconsistent with the attitude of openness which the
local Governments are bound to maintain. If not, what becomes of Mr.
Lytteltonâs statement that at least the <i>status  </i><i>quo  </i><i>ante</i><i>
</i><i>bellum </i>would be kept up? Moreover, the prejudices of the
town councils and local boards of the Transvaal are very strong on
the colour question. They do not hesitate to proclaim them from
house-tops, and some of the councils and boards would even go so far
as to use violence, if they could. Under the circumstances, whilst
there is a position of uncertainty as to the future, it seems strange
that the Transvaal Government should bring in legislation as if Law 3
of 1885 were never to be erased from the Statute-book.</p>

Our contemporary, the <i>Transvaal Leader, </i>publishes a message
from its Pretoria Correspondent to the effect that His Excellency Sir
Arthur Lawley granted a private interview to the leaders of the
anti-Asiatic Convention, among whom were present Messrs Loveday and
Bourke. The <i>Leaderâs </i>correspondent also states that the
interview was prolonged and that the interviewers left Sir Arthur
with complete satisfaction. The curtain is then drawn over what
actually took place. Lord Selborne, when he met the Boer leaders and
members of the Responsible Association, adopted a different attitude.
He invited the Press, and saw to it that the proceedings were made
public. Why, then, should there be so much secrecy about Asiatic
affairs? If the interviewers sought it does it mean that they are
afraid of broad daylight being shed upon their doings and their
statements; and if Sir Arthur courted privacy, we respectfully ask
what was the motive? Was</p>

it that he anticipated the wildest statements from Mr. Loveday and
was anxious to hide his shame? British Indians court fullest
publicity as to whatever may have to be said against them or for
them. They have nothing to fear, exaggerating nothing and minimising
nothing, and having absolute justice on their side. Let us,
therefore, hope that there may yet be an opportunity given to British
Indians in the Transvaal of at any rate, examining statements made by
the interviewers to His Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor behind
their backs.</p>

The Town Council of Krugersdorp has received the doctorâs report
after the meeting about Indians was held there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>The doctor says that the houses Of Indians are found to
be mostly unclean; that they spit all around; that their lavatories
are very dirty and water collects on the floor and never dries; and
that they sit and sleep on the counters, etc. We know that much of
this is untrue, and it is now up to the Indians in Krugersdorp to
obtain another report to counter all this. Nevertheless, we will have
to assent to these accusations  to  some extent. Nobody can deny that
we spit any and everywhere and allow the lavatories to remain dirty.
Our people are generally disinclined to cleaning lavatories
themselves. We feel it necessary to overcome this. It is an
established fact that many diseases spread through lavatories. It is
very easy to keep them clean. One should spread dry dust or ashes
into the bucket every time after use, wash the wooden planks with a
disinfectant liquid and wipe them clean. If done regularly, this does
not take much time and the cause for this antipathy disappears.</p>

The matter of spiting also needs to be thought about. Everything
considered, it is very necessary to cultivate the habit of spitting
into a handkerchief or a spittoon, instead of all over the house or
shop.</p>

No laws have so far been enacted in respect of Indian hotels in the
Transvaal. Licences are taken out for Kaffir eating-houses and
European hotels. Chinese hotels came to be opened when the number of
Chinese increased in the Transvaal. No licences are necessary for
them. But the Chinese, apprehending trouble in the future, applied of
their own accord to the Government for licences. The latter replied
that no licences were necessary. The Chinese believed that no hotel
could be opened without a licence, and, therefore, applied to the
Government saying that a licensing law should be enacted. A Bill on
the subject has now been published in the <i>Government Gazette,
</i>which shows how one has to suffer the results of oneâs
actions.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>The
Indian hotel-keepers will now have to take out licences. It is not
even possible to oppose the Bill. All Indian innkeepers in the
Transvaal should, therefore, take heed. We believe that licences will
be granted only if the premises are quite clean.</p>

Italy as a nation came into existence recently. Before 1870 Italy
comprised a number of small principalities, each with its petty
chief. Before 1870, she was like the India or Kathiawad of today.
Though the people spoke the same language and had the same character,
they all owed allegiance to different petty states. Today Italy is an
independent European country and her people are regarded as a
distinct nation. All this can be said to be the achievement of one
man. And his nameâJoseph Mazzini. Joseph Mazzini was born in Genoa
on June 22, 1805. He was a man of such sterling character, so
good-natured and so patriotic, that great preparations are being made
throughout Europe to commemorate the centenary of his birth. For,
although he dedicated his whole life to the service of Italy, he was
so broadminded that he could be regarded a citizen of every country.
It was his constant yearning that every nation should become great
and live in unity.</p>

Even at the early age of thirteen, Mazzini showed great intelligence
In spite of great scholarship that he evidenced, he gave up his books
out of patriotism and undertook the study of law, and began using his
legal knowledge gratuitously to help the poor. Then he joined a
secret organization which was working for the unification of Italy.
When the Italian chiefs learnt of this, they put him into prison.
While still in prison, he continued to advance his plans for freeing
his country. At last he had to leave Italy. He went to Marseilles and
lived there. The Italian princes, however, using their influence, had
him banished from that city. Though obliged to fly from place to
place, he did not lose heart and kept on sending his writings
secretly to Italy, which gradually influenced the minds of the
people. He suffered a lot in the process. He had to run about in
disguise to evade spies. Even his life was frequently in danger, but
he did not care.  At last he went  to England in 1837. He did not
suffer so much there but had to live in extreme poverty. In England
he came into contact with the great leaders of that country and
sought their aid.</p>

In 1848 Mazzini returned with Garibaldi to Italy, and set up the
self-governing State of Italy. But it did not last long, thanks to
the activities of crafty persons and though Mazzini had to flee the
country once again, his influence did not fade. The seed of unity
that he had sown endured and, though Mazzini remained in banishment,
Italy became a single united kingdom in 1870. Victor Emmanuel became
its king. Mazzini was gratified to see his country thus united. But
as he was not permitted to enter the country, he used to go there in
disguise. Once when the police went to arrest him, he opened the door
for them as if he were an usher and gave them the slip.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
This great man died on March, 1873. His foes had now become his
friends. People had come to recognise his true worth. Eighty thousand
people joined his funeral procession. He was buried at the highest
spot in Genoa. Today Italy and the whole of Europe worship this man.
In Italy he is considered one of the greatest of men. He was  a pious
and religious man, ever free from selfishness and  pride. Poverty was
for him an ornament. The sufferings of  others  he  regarded as his
own. There are very few instances in the world where a single man has
brought about the uplift of his country by his strength of mind and
his extreme devotion during his own lifetime. Such was the unique
Mazzini.</p>

Indians are now-a-days being subjected to very great severity in the
matter of permits in the Transvaal. Many persons  who  were  staying
on false permits have been deported. Some, whose permits did not bear
their thumb-impressions, have been sentenced  to imprisonment for six
weeks. It is probable that many more personswill be subjected to
hardships.It is also believed that Permit Officers will visit
different villages for investigation. It is therefore necessary that
those who hold false permits should immediately leave the Transvaal.
They should not under any circumstances make use of false permits;
otherwise they will have to suffer imprisonment.</p>

So far boys under sixteen and women were allowed to enter without a
permit; but since the scrutiny of permits started, greater strictness
is being exercised on the border. Boys under sixteen not accompanied
by their fathers and women not accompanied by their husbands are
being detained for want of permits.  A  woman proceeding to the
Transvaal was made to detrain at Volksrust as she was not accompanied
by her husband. Indians entering the Transvaal should therefore bear
the following things in mind:</p>

	The Krugersdorp Town Council has sent a representation to the
	Government that a law should be enacted for the compulsory removal
	of Indians to Locations. The Transvaal Government have replied
	saying that nothing can be done at present as the matter was still
	the subject of correspondence between them and the Imperial
	Government. It appears from this that the controversy between Mr.
	Lyttelton and Sir Arthur Lawley is still going on. Sir Arthur wants
	laws enacted that would apply to Indians alone. The outcome is not
	likely to be known before the next year. Meanwhile, we hope Indians
	in Krugersdorp will keep their houses clean and tidy.</p>

Admiral Rozhdzhestvenskyâs<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>letter addressed  to  the  Czar setting forth all Acts
about the defeat sustained by the Baltic Fleet makes sad reading.
Though the letter is written by a defeated Admiral, no one will take
the reasons he has mentioned therein as excuses to explain his
defeat. The secret facts, now revealed, clearly show that the
crushing defeat sustained by the Fleet was only to be expected. The
ablest of the worldâs naval officers used to say that the Baltic
Fleet would teach the Japanese the lesson of their lives. They made
this forecast because the men-of-war in the Fleet were gigantic, they
were very well equipped with armaments, and could move very  swiftly.
They carried the best artillery of the latest type, and their
admirals were considered very capable. But, as Admiral
Rozhdzhestvensky says, the greatness of the Fleet existed on paper
only. In his letter to the Czar, he says that, thanks to the
corruption in the administration, not only was the building of the
ships disgraceful, but they were not in fact properly equipped with
the necessary armaments, etc. The guns were incapable of discharging
shots as desired; enough coal could not be stored in the hulk; the
speed of the ships was falsely praised; the engines always made a
creaking noise as if in a ramshackle condition; two-thirds of the
sailors were unfit for their jobs; the gunners had no sense of duty;
and the worst of it all was that, after leaving</p>

Madagascar, all the men on board became rebellious. When such a fleet
joins battle, defeat can be the only result. The letter gives a
graphic account of what happened after they left Formosa. The Admiral
was already aware of this condition of his Fleet; and the fact that
he undertook to fight under these circumstances and showed such
bravery is sufficient testimony to his loyalty.</p>

Mr. James A. Polkinghorne has issued his yearly report ending 31st
December last. As a contemporary states, the report is belated, as
are most of the Government reports in Natal; consequently, there is
no doubt there is not the same interest taken in them that would be
if they were issued promptly. The present report is a document of
more than ordinary interest in that it throws a good deal of light on
the working of the Immigration Law as to re-indenture and poll-tax.
It gives also a more accurate census of the indentured Indian
population than hitherto. The information given by the Protector is
an âeye-openerâ. The Indian population has increased very
considerably during the past three years. Between 1876 and 1896, it
was 31,712, in 1902, it was 78,004, at the end of 1904, it was
87,980, showing an increase in two years of nearly 10,000; and yet
the Protector states in another place that he has not been able to
supply the full number applied for in 1902, namely, 19,000. The
demand for such labour is so great that it has been necessary to
refuse fresh applications altogether.  The  reason for this large
increase is obvious. This class of labour is very popular and is
daily growing in popularity in the Colony. The men who come out give
great satisfaction, and the bread and butter of thousands of Colonist
depends very largely upon a steady inflow of indentured labour from
India. The moral, too, is obvious. The noise that we find here about
the Indian being an undesirable citizen is largely hypocritical or
selfish. We had a striking corroboration of the deduction to be made
from the above figures in the observation- srecently made by His
Excellency the Governor of Natal at the time of the opening of the

much evaded, and that it has failed in inducing  the  time-expired
Indian to return to India. Many of those who have remained have
succeeded in escaping the poll-tax. Last year, 888 men and  345 women
completed their indenture under the new Law. Out of this number, only
137 men and 32 women offered themselves for re-indenture. 201 men and
58 women returned to India, 375 men and 146 women paid the tax, and
170 men and 105 women were at the time of drawing up the report
unaccounted for. Nor is this to be wondered at. The poll-tax is never
at any time a satisfactory mode of raising revenue. It has not been a
deterrent to settlement in the Colony. The framers of the act never
expected any such result. It constitutes a source of irritation to
the indentured Indian. It levies from them unjustifiable contribution
and constitutes a blot on the fair name of Natal. What is more, it is
imposed on men whose services are considered, as has been already
shown, to be indispensable to the welfare of the Colony.</p>

The reply given by Baron Komura to a question from the Press
representatives in New York wanting to know the cause of Japanâs
victory deserves to be inscribed in oneâs mind. One reason he gave
was that Japanâs demand was just; the second was that she was
united; there was no corruption either among the officers or the
people; every one did his duty; the Japanese were not indolent; they
did not shirk work; and they lived in great simplicity. Thanks to
this simplicity, they were able to hold their own against the
Russians. As their needs by way of clothing and food were few, these
could be transported to the soldiers in fewer vehicles. Consequently,
it was not very difficult for the Japanese to transport large numbers
of men over long distances.</p>

I venture to submit that in all such cases the issuing of a duplicate
permit or some certificate is necessary in order to enable the
registered residents to return without difficulty. My client is about
to proceed to India, and I shall, therefore, be obliged if you will

shown me the guarantee  taken  by  the bank. I think it is totally
uncalled for. In my opinion the deed of dissolution does not in the
slightest degree affect the bankâs security. I do not understand
the reason for altering the bond. However, seeing that all the
transfers have to be newly made, it does not much matter. I hope you
will hurry the matter forward. There should be no difficulty about
taking out Mr. Mahomed Ebrahimâs name, because even if he does not
consent, the order of court will be quite enough.  I understand that
it is the desire of all parties to advertise the dissolution in the

advertisement<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
If you approve of it, it can be signed by all the five partners and
advertised in the <i>Gazette </i>there, the <i>Gazette </i>here, and

I was pleased beyond measure at the extreme prudence and calmness
with which you approached the conferences we had there, and it is my
earnest hope and prayer that both the businesses may flourish and
that all of you may remain in perfect harmony. I would also ask you

long run the future of South Africa is assured. We will have to go

best in the end. I have no doubt that there is a great deal of
business to be done, but a very large measure of circumspection is

	In this matter the case was heard this morning. Two witnesses gave
	evidence to the effect that 1 lb. of butter was asked for and a pat,
	like the one shown by Mr. Levy to me, was given to the inspector,
	and after the money had passed, the inspector weighed the pat, and
	while he was weighing, the accused pointed to the inscription on the
	pat. This was clearly an offence under the law, but the Magistrate
	held that the accused was quite innocent in the matter and,
	therefore, imposed a penalty of Â£1 only. This was the best I could
	do under the circumstances. It seems that there was a similar case
	last week in Court. It also came out in the evidence that the
	inscription on the pat sold was very illegible. Unless, therefore,
	there is a very  much  bolder inscription written on all sides of
	the label, I am afraid that the retailers would run the risk of
	being fined and fined very heavily because the ordinary penalty is
	Â£20 for selling pats of the above description to a customer to a
	demand for l lb. weight. I, therefore, [think that there] should be
	better inscription, or that all your customers should be told that
	each time they sell these pats, they should say that the weight is
	not guaranteed in any way.</p>

	Thanks to the action of the Rand Pioneers, the Church Council of

Excellency the desirability of not tampering with the rights of the
Natives as they existed before the war. The Attorney-General of the
Transvaal has shown how the Native was free to own land in the
Transvaal before the war. He was able even to cite an instance when
the late President Kruger<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>informed certain petitioners, who wanted to curtail the
rights of the Natives regarding land, that he could not comply with
their request. It is true that the Natives were not, in practice,
allowed to have their titles registered in their own names, but as
the Attorney-General has clearly shown, the registration of a Native
title in the name of the Commissioner for Native Affairs did not
clothe that official with any discretionary power. He was bound to
take transfer in his name in trust for a Native and was equally bound
to take in any other Native as a <i>cestui </i><i>que </i><i>trust </i>at
the instance of the original holder. In reply to the clamour of the
anti-Native agitators led by Sir George Farrar,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>Sir Richard Solomon has, much against his own
inclinations, promised to introduce legislation to legalise the
practice of registration of Native titles in favour of the
Commissioner for Native Affairs. Against this, the Rand Pioneers have
again commenced an agitation. They insist on the Native Commissioner
having  the  power to refuse to act as trustee. If the request were
granted, it would undoubtedly take away from the right of the Native
to hold land as it existed before the war.</p>

It is against agitation of this nature that the Church Council has
raised its voice. The deputation led by Mr. Hosken made it clear to
Lord Selborne that the treatment the Coloured races have been
receiving in the Transvaal since British occupation is worse than 
before. He and his fellow-members also showed that the war was
justified in the opinion of many because they considered it a war of
emancipation. The Rev. Mr. Philips said that he went at his own
expense to England to preach the crusade because he could not bear
the hardships that were inflicted under the Boer regime on the
Coloured races. But the reverend gentleman now found that these races
were no better off under the British rule.</p>

sufficiently studied the question. He could not, therefore, pronounce
an opinion. But His Excellency added:</p>

them. And the policy laid down by Lord Selborne is the policy

The proposal of the Natal Parliament to enact laws on Locations and
the levy of a tax on land has miscarried owing to the rejection by
the Legislative Council of both these Bills, along with the Bill to
levy a tax on the Kaffirs. Therefore, for the time being at least,
our apprehensions about Locations have been allayed. Though we cannot
say that these Bills have been thrown out because of our petition,
there is no doubt that it has had some effect. The lesson we have to
learn from this is that any efforts that we might make are bound to
bring some measure of success.</p>

The Supreme Court of the Transvaal has always given the benefit of
the law to Coloured persons that is, it metes out even-handed justice
without fear of the whites, regarding them and Coloured persons equal
in the eyes of the law. There is in Roodepoort  a church belonging to
the Kaffirs. In deciding an application  to transfer it to the names
of its trustees, the High Court<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

the name of a Native; the law does not prohibit such transfer of
land. It appears from this case that the mosques situated in

As the time for reviewing the treaty between England and Japan draws
near, it is being discussed in English political circles. A peace
treaty, to hold good for five years, was signed between the two
countries on January 30, 1902. But, if by the end of the fourth year,
no notice to terminate the treaty was given by either party, the
treaty would continue to be in force even beyond the five years, and
thereafter the party desiring to end the treaty would have to give a
yearâs notice. Moreover, if at the end of the treaty period either
of the parties was engaged in war, the treaty would remain effective
till peace was restored.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Moreover, if either party had to go to war against a third power, the
other contracting party should strive to prevent any other power from
joining it. And if any such power rendered help to the party opposing
either of the signatories to the treaty, the other signatory should
rush to the help of the former.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
If, therefore, a notice in accordance with the above terms to end the
treaty is not served by either party by January 30, next year, it
will remain operative beyond five years. If on the contrary such a
notice is served in the meanwhile and Japanâs war with Russia
continues, the treaty would remain in force till the end of the war,
even if the period of the treaty as originally stipulated had come to
an end.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
This treaty has proved very advantageous to both England and Japan.
As a matter of fact, the whole world can be said to have benefited
from it. For, if a third power had entered the war to help Russia,
England would have been obliged to go to the aid of Japan, and this
would have obviously disturbed world peace. There is, therefore,
every reason to hope that this treaty will continue further.</p>

I am in receipt of your letter. It is no longer possible to write to
the High Commissioner. The only thing that remains to be done is to
proceed to England. Or it may be possible if some trouble occurs here
again. Please meet the Mayor of your place and find out what he has
to say in the matter. I cannot advise you to write to England
immediately; for, if Tayob Sheth comes here, the real fight will have
to be put up here. With each passing day, it will become more and
more difficult. It will be better if you send a cable as follows:</p>

Lord Curzon has long been considering the partitioning of Bengal into
two parts and merging one of them in Assam. In justification of the
proposed measure, it is argued that Bengal is too large for one
Governor to administer. As against this, it is pointed out that Assam
is a small province with a very small population and, that it adjoins
Bengal. It is therefore the intention of His Excellency the
Governor-General to merge a part of Bengal in Assam. On the other</p>

side, the people of Bengal argue that the Bengalis are quite distinct
from the Assamese; they are highly educated, and they have been
living together for generations. It would therefore be an act of
grave injustice to separate and thus weaken them and tag large
numbers of them on to Assam. A lot of discussion has already taken
place over this matter, and a few days ago Mr. Brodrick declared that
he had approved Lord Curzonâs proposal. Since this news reached
India, meetings have been held in almost every village of Bengal.
People of all communities have been participating in them. Even
Chinese merchants seem to have taken part. These meetings are said to
have been so impressive that long telegraphic reports have reached
far-off South Africa. Resolutions challenging the Government were,
for the first time it would appear, moved at these meetings. It
appears to have been suggested in the course of the speeches that, if
the Government did not take heed, Indian merchants should stop all
trade with Great Britain. We must admit that our people have learnt
these tactics from China. But if the people really act  accordingly, 
there  would  be nothing surprising if our troubles came to a speedy
end. For, if this is done, Great Britain will be put to great loss;
and the Government can have no means of dealing with it. They cannot
compel the people to carry on trade. The method is very straight and
simple. But will our people in Bengal maintain the requisite unity?
Will the merchants suffer for the good of the country? If we can
answer both these questions in the affirmative, India can be said to
have truly woken up.</p>

Last year, the Legislative Council passed a resolution requesting Mr.
Lyttelton to appoint a commission to go into the grievances of the
Indians in the Transvaal. Sir Mancherji had written saying that he
approved of the idea of appointing a commission. A question was again
asked about this [in Parliament] by that honourable gentleman, to
which Mr. Lyttelton replied that the matter was still  under
discussion. From this it appears that the Transvaal Government is
still carrying on a controversy with Mr. Lyttelton and that there is
no agreement between them. Mr. Lyttelton wants that immigration laws
should be enacted on the lines of those in Natal while Sir Arthur
Lawley wants those laws which would apply to Indians alone.</p>

There are many reasons why the British should be ruling over us and
why we are in such a deplorable condition. One of the reasons is that
in modern times the British seem to have produced a larger  number
than we of brave and pious men and women of high principles.
Nevertheless we believe that we are bound to benefit from a knowledge
and constant contemplation of the lives of such devout men and women,
and we therefore propose to give the stories of their lives from time
to time. We hope that the readers of this journal will read their
lives and follow them in practice and thus encourage us. We have
suggested earlier that each one of our subscribers  should maintain a
file of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion. </i>We remind them of it on this
occasion.</p>

Mrs. Elizabeth Fry lived in England a century ago. She was a very
religious-minded lady and it was her constant concern to help
mitigate the sufferings of man. Though herself a chronic invalid she
did not care; she was not to be daunted by personal suffering. There
is a prison called the Newgate Prison in England where, a hundred
years ago, men and women prisoners were huddled together somehow and
lived quite uncared for. They were in an extremely bad state. Crime
among them, instead of diminishing, was on the increase. Their life
was more like that of cattle. Consequently, the condition of Newgate
prisoners who were released after their sentences became very
pitiable. This misery, the good Elizabeth could not bear to see.Her
heart was deeply grieved, and she dedicated her life to the
amelioration of their condition. Having obtained permission of the
authorities, she began helping, in particular, the women prisoners,
whom she  used to comfort. But she did not stop here. By her writings
and personal effort she got a number of reforms introduced  through 
the authorities. As a result of her efforts the condition of
prisoners improved much. But this she considered quite inadequate. In
those days, prisoners used to be deported to Australia. They were
subjected to great harassment while on board ships. Even the honour
of women prisoners was not safe. Elizabeth saw that all her good work
was being undone on board the ships while the prisoners were being
thus transported. To remedy this evil, she visited the ships at great
personal inconvenience. At last she succeeded in putting an end to

improvement in the miserable condition of the prisoners in Australia;
and a law was accordingly passed to the effect that prisoners, on
reaching Australia, were to be passed on to others for service after
being trained there for six months. While thus sharing in  the
sufferings of many unfortunate persons, this good lady forgot her own
suffering, and breathed her last, praying to God.</p>

South Africa has had the unique honour of welcoming on its own soil
this body of illustrious scientists. The British Association for the
Advancement of Science is an institution of which the Empire may well
feel proud. It was a happy idea that prompted the South African
Association to invite their prototype to visit this sub-continent.
The results are likely to be far-reaching. Not only will something be
done for the main object of the Associationâviz., the
popularisation of scienceâbut the visit will help to secure a more
important result in drawing together South Africa and Britain, and
the Colonies with one another. This is the third time that the
Association has met outside the British Isles; and, in view of the
importance of these visits and the cordiality with which the members
have been received, it is not likely to be the last. We look forward
to the day when the Association will meet in India. Such a visit
would, we believe, be greatly to the advantage not only of India, but
the Association itself.</p>

The inevitable has happened and Lord Curzon is no more an Indian
Viceroy. It is an irony of fate that when he seemed to be
irremovable, he had to go under circumstances the most humiliating. A
Viceroy to whom prestige was everything and who relied greatly on it
for success in many things he undertook has been obliged to leave
India without a vestige of it remaining. That such a fate should be
brought about by the discredit of a War Minister adds point to the
degradation Lord Curzon has had to undergo. It would almost appear to
be an answer to the prayer of the suffering millions who were
groaning under his autocratic rule.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.22cm; line-height: 102%">
We think that, in all he did, Lord Curzon was actuated by good
intentions. He undoubtedly believed that he was doing good to the
people of India in spite of themselves, in forcing down their throats
what he was pleased to term reforms. No Viceroy excited on the
threshold of his career the expectations that Lord Curzon did. His
speeches led the Indians to believe that he would out-Ripon Ripon<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>in his treatment of Indian problems. In his minute on
the behaviour of the British soldiers, he even translated his
promises into deeds. His reduction of the salt tax and his advocacy
of the cause of British Indians in South Africa will always stand to
his credit. But when full allowance has been made for these things,
the net result is such that he has succeeded in earning the dislike
of the people at the end of his career, in the same measure that he
began with their goodwill. Even though the cause of his resignation
is unfortunate in that it betokens the triumph of military autocracy
over civilian rule, we can quite imagine that today in thousands of
Indian homes there must be a time of joy and thanksgiving for what
will be considered, not  without reason, a good deliverance.</p>

The career of Lord Curzon makes it very risky to base any
expectations upon the new Viceroy; and it would be perhaps far safer
to expect nothing if we would be blessed; but in Lord Minto, the
Viceroy-designate, India will have a nobleman not unknown to it, as
he belongs to an illustrious family which has already given a Viceroy

Professor Parmanand, the distinguished scholar from the Anglo-Vedic
College, has been in our midst now for a few weeks. He has delivered
interesting discourses to crowded audiences. His mission seems to be
to advance the teachings of the Arya Samaj, which is a body that has
done most useful and practical work, apart from its religious
doctrines. It has produced earnest patriots, a band of
self-sacrificing teachers, and it has also done  noble  work  in
connection with the terrible earthquake that took place in India a
few months back. The Professor who belongs to such a body of workers
has a right to expect a warm welcome from Indians in South Africa.
Indeed, we cannot have in our midst too many Indians of attainments
and culture.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 95%">
The question, however, remains as to what we shall make of such men
and what they will make of us. We confess that we are not yet ripe
for a vigorous missionary enterprise on religious lines. The soil is
hardly ready for such work. Not that each religion may not have its
own exponent and custodian. The Arya Samaj does not represent any
established orthodox religion of India. It takes nothing away from
its credit when we mention that it is still a cult struggling for
existence and catering for converts. It represents a reformation of
Hinduism. We feel that Indians in South Africa are not ready to
receive any doctrines of reformation. The needs of the Indians, so
far as internal work is concerned, consist of education and as much
of it of the right kind as can be had. We have always admitted that
there is room  for improvement in the Indian household. This is not
to be attained  without education of the hundreds of Indian youths
who are almost totally neglected in this sub-continent. The best
thing we venture to think that Professor Parmanand can do is to turn
his attention to this phase of the question. It is a most practical
and effective mode  of</p>

The time has now passed when the followers of one religion can stand
and say, ours is the only true religion and all others are false. The
growing spirit of toleration towards all religions is  a  happy
augury of the future. An article appeared recently in the columns of
<i>The Christian World, </i>a London religious weekly, over the
signature of âJ.B.â, one of that journalâs regular
contributors, on this question, extracts from which I intend to
quote.</p>

The writer, in a most liberal and generous spirit, reviews the
question from the Christian standpoint, and shews how the worldâs
religions are linked one with the other, each having characteristics
common to all others. The appearance of such an article in the
Christian Press is worth noting, and shews that it is moving with the
times. A few years back, such an article would have been classed as
heretical teaching, and its author denounced as a traitor to the
cause.</p>

After remarking upon the new spirit which was changing the attitude

To Europeans and Indians working together for the common good, this
has a special significance. India, with its ancient religions, has
much to give, and the bond of unity between us can best be fostered
by a wholehearted sympathy and  appreciation  of each otherâs form
of religion. A greater toleration on this important question would
mean a wider charity in our everyday relations, and the existing
misunderstandings would be swept away. Is it not also a fact that
between Mahomedan and Hindu there is a great need for this
toleration? Sometimes one is inclined to think it is even greater
than between East and West. Let not strife and tumult destroy the
harmony between Indians themselves. A house divided against itself
must fall, so let me urge the necessity for perfect unity and 
brotherliness  between all sections of the Indian community.</p>

The Czar of Russia has given effect to his promise to his people
regarding the introduction of a constitution based on the elective
principle. From the cables received in South Africa regarding its
clauses, it appears that it resembles very little the more democratic
constitutions of modern times, which give wider powers to the people.
It is also very doubtful if even this constitution will be given full
effect to. Under this constitution the power of making laws is
apparently vested in an elected body. Despite all these terms and
clauses, however, the Czar has kept his sovereign authority intact.
This has given the constitution a strange appearance. It makes
imperative the assent of the Czar to whatever laws are passed by the
elected National Council. Nobody believes that this Council will be
able to exercise any check on the Czarâs power. Nevertheless, it
cannot be denied that the new constitution is a step which will
enable the people to make greater efforts in the future.</p>

Last week we gave a life-sketch of Elizabeth Fry. This time we give
an account of the life of a former American President.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; line-height: 110%">
It is believed that the greatest and the noblest man of the last
century was Abraham Lincoln. He was born in America in 1809 of very
poor parents. He received very little education until  he  was 
fifteen years old. He could hardly read or write and earned his
meagre living, wandering from place to place.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%">
At last he thought of bettering his lot. There being no steamers or
other means of transport in those days, he voyaged through the big
rivers on a country raft made of wooden planks and visited the
various towns in America. At one place he got the job of a shop
assistant. He was then twenty years old. Once he had a job it
occurred to him that he might study further. Thereupon, he bought a
few books and began to study them by himself. Meanwhile one of his
relatives thought that Abraham might be able to do better if he
studied law; and he apprenticed him to a lawyer, with whom Abraham
worked with great</p>

diligence and studied books. He showed such ability that his
superiors were much pleased with him. He too felt that he was now in
a position to serve the people among whom he was born. No sooner had
the thought occurred to him than he decided, in accordance with
American practice, to stand for election to the Senate. His  first
pamphlet fully revealed his special qualities. He put up a strong
fight; but he met with defeat as he was yet an unknown man, while his
opponent was well known. But the defeat only whetted his zeal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.28cm; line-height: 95%">
His fervour became more intense. Only a person who has a clear
picture in his mind of the America of those days, can properly
appreciate Lincolnâs virtues and his services. From north to south,
America was at this time a camp of slaves. Nobody saw anything wrong
in openly selling Negroes and keeping them in slavery. The high and
the low, the rich and the poor saw nothing strange in owning slaves.
No one thought it was wrong to do so. Religious minded men, priests
and the like saw nothing amiss and did not protest against the system
of slavery being kept up. Some even encouraged it, and all of them
thought that slavery also was a divine dispensation and that the
Negroes were born to it. Few could then see that the slave trade was
very wicked and irreligious. And even those who did, preferred to
remain silent, being unable to assert themselves. There were some who
were content to play a minor role in the amelioration of the
condition of slaves. Even today our hair stands on end to hear the
accounts of the atrocities inflicted on slaves. They were tied up and
beaten; they were forced to work, they were branded and handcuffed.
And all this was not done just to one person but to all of them. It
may be said without fear of contradiction that Lincoln alone, of all
men, made and put into execution his resolution to change the ideas
of men, ideas which were indelibly carved on their minds, to wage war
against those hundreds of thousands of men who depended for their
living on the system and to set free the slaves from bondage. He was
so tender by nature, his faith in God was so great, and his
compassion so deep that he began to convert the minds of men through
his speeches and writings as well as by the example of his own life.
Eventually there came into existence two parties in America: one
headed by Lincoln, another by his opponents; and a big civil war
broke out;but Lincoln remained undaunted. By this time he had risen
so high up the ladder that he was already the President. The war went
on for many years, but Lincoln abolished slavery from the whole of
North America by l858-9. The bonds of the slaves were broken, and
wherever Lincolnâs name was mentioned, he was hailed as a great
emancipator of men in distress. The language of the powerful speeches
he delivered during</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
these stormy days is so sublime that they rank very high in English
literature.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.23cm; line-height: 102%">
Although he had achieved such eminence Lincoln remained full of
humility. He always believed that a powerful nation or individual
ought to use that power to remove the miseries of the poor and the
weak, not to crush them. Though America was his motherland and he was
an American, he regarded the whole world as his native land. Just
when he was at the height of his glory, and despite the fact that he
was such a good man, some wicked men felt that he had ruined many
people by abolishing slavery. So when it was known for certain that
Lincoln was going to visit a theatre, a plot was hatched to
assassinate him. Even the players at the theatre had been seduced,
and a leading actor had undertaken to shoot him. As Lincoln was
sitting in his special box, the despicable fellow entered it, closed
the door after him and shot at Lincoln. The good man fell dead. The
people who witnessed this dreadful deed tore the assassin to pieces
before he could be taken to a law court.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>In this tragic manner occurred the death of the greatest
President of America. It may safely be said that Lincoln sacrificed
his life in order to put an end to the sufferings of others. But
Lincoln can be said to be still alive; for the changes he made in the
American Constitution are still in force. And Lincolnâs name will
be known as long as America endures. It will thus be seen that
Lincoln has become immortal, for his greatness consisted not in his
talent or his wealth, but in his innate goodness. A nation that has
such good qualities as Lincolnâs is bound to rise.</p>

I have the honour to acknowledge your letter of the 18th inst.,
numbered P.S. 15/05, in reply to the submission by my Association of
the 1st July last,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

persons in the Orange River Colony.</p>

My Association respectfully submits that, if there are no British
Indians in the Location, it is a wanton insult offered to the British
Indian community to apply the Location Regulations to it, especially
as my Association is still not without hope that some day relief will
be granted to the British Indians in the matter of immigration to
that Colony. My Association cannot understand why the Location
Bye-laws, which are meant to deal with the Natives of the country,
should be made applicable by an artificial  definition  to  British
Indians.</p>

My Association has not raised any objection to a regulation for the
compulsory registration of Native servants, but my Association is
respectfully of the opinion that the bracketing of British Indians
with the Natives of South Africa is in principle wrong and unjust. I
am, therefore, directed humbly to request relief in the matter.</p>

My Association has been informed that a new rule has been introduced
in the Permit Office whereby British Indian refugees are required to
furnish two European references instead of any two  known references,
as hitherto. My Association submits that the proposed rule is, first,
an insult to the British Indian community in that it implies want of
faith in Indian testimony, and secondly, is impracticable in that
there are few Indians who are known to the European residents by
name. Store-keepers, assistants, salesmen and domestic servants in
the employ of British Indians rarely come into contact with
Europeans, and to expect them to produce European references would be
tantamount to rejection of their application for a permit. Thirdly,
it would put a premium on perjury, as it is quite conceivable that a
few unscrupulous Indians will not find it difficult to find a few
unscrupulous Europeans who would be prepared to perjure themselves
for a consideration.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 95%">
My Association, therefore, submits that the only safeguard is to be
found in the respectability of references, irrespective of race or
colour. Even then it is quite likely that some cases of perjury would
happen, but that would be purely a matter for action against those
who would lend themselves to such practices. One or two successful
prosecutions would certainly do away with them. At the same time, my
Association draws your attention to the fact that such questionable
practices in the face of enormous temptations have  been
comparatively rare in connection with the permits. It is indisputable
that there were over 15,000 British Indian male adults resident in
the Transvaal before War. Only about 12,000 appear on your register.
It is reasonable, therefore, to presume that most of the men who have
received their permits are pre-War residents of the Transvaal.</p>

My Association respectfully trusts that the rule will be  withdrawn,
and that the refugees who are now awaiting permission to return will
have their applications granted without delay, as, in accordance with
the information in possession of my Association, theyare suffering
very severe inconvenience and loss.</p>

Mount Edgecombe. Here  these people were shown two things. Firstly,
they were shown what the savage Negroes were like, and also their
dances, etc. They were thereafter introduced to educated Kaffirs.

In the course of his eloquent speech Mr. Dubey said that the contempt
with which the Kaffirs were regarded was unjustified. The educated
among them were better than the uneducated ones, for they worked
more, and since they had higher standards of life, they offered more
custom to the merchants. It was unfair to burden the Negroes with
taxes; also it was like cutting down the very branch one was sitting
on. The Kaffirs understood and performed their duties better than the
whites. They worked hard and without them the whites could not carry
on for a moment. They made loyal subjects, and Natal was the land of
their birth. For them there was no country other than South Africa;
and to deprive them of their rights over lands, etc., was like
banishing them from their home.</p>

It is believed that, in the western world at any rate, there is no
man so talented, learned and as ascetic as Count Tolstoy. Though he
is now nearly eighty years old, he is quite healthy, industrious and
mentally alert.</p>

Tolstoy was born of a noble family in Russia. His parents had
enormous wealth, which he inherited. He is himself a Russian
nobleman, and has, in his youth, rendered very good service to his
country by fighting gallantly in the Crimean War. In those days, like
the other noblemen of his time, he used to enjoy all the pleasures of
the world, kept mistresses, drank and was strongly addicted to
smoking. However, when he saw the carnage and bloodshed during the
war, his mind brimmed over with compassion. His ideas changed; he
began a study of his own religion and read the Bible. He read the
life of Jesus Christ which made a deep impression on his mind. Not
satisfied with the then current Russian translation of the Bible, he
studied Hebrew, the language in which it was originally written, and
continued his researches into the Bible. It was also about this time
that he discovered in himself a great talent for writing. He wrote a
very effective book on the evil consequences of war. His fame spread
throughout Europe. To improve the morals of the people he wrote
several novels which can be equalled by few books in Europe. The
views expressed by him in all these books were so very advanced that
the Russian clergy were displeased with him, and he was
excommunicated. Disregarding all this, he kept up his efforts and
began to propagate his ideas. His writings had a great effect on his
own mind. He gave up his wealth and took to a life of poverty. He has
lived like a peasant for many years now and earns his needs by his
own labour. He has given up all his vices, eats very simple food and
has it in him no longer to hurt any living being by thought, word or</p>

Tolstoy is still writing with great energy. Though himself a Russian,
he has written many strong and bitter things against Russia
concerning the Russo-Japanese War. He has addressed a very pungent
and effective letter to the Czar in regard to the war. Selfish
officers view him with bitterness, but they, and even the Czar, fear
and respect him. Such is the power of his goodness and godly living
that millions of peasants are ever ready to carry out his wish no
sooner than it is spoken.</p>

The world over, all eyes are turned today towards Japan. Every one
admires that countryâs bravery and sagacity. Count Okuma, a former
Minister of Japan, has written an article in the <i>North </i><i>American
</i><i>Review, </i>wherein he says that the present greatness of
Japan is the result of reforms carried out over the centuries. She
had remained backward in the eyes of the world simply because of her
defective system of education. Japan found that she could not

her sons to foreign lands for learning the various sciences and arts.
The patriotism shown by her in this regard saved the countryâs
prestige. She introduced the best educational methods from foreign
lands. She also introduced compulsory education for boys and girls.
At the same time, she did not fail to attend to crafts and industry.
She employed foreign experts until her own young men and women had
completed their training.</p>

When the educational scheme came into full operation, the Mikado
issued an order to be read out in every school. It ran: âMay you,
our subjects, be devoted to your parents; be loving towards your
brothers and sisters; live in peace and amity with your husband or
wife; be straightforward in your conduct; be increasingly good and
helpful to others; develop your virtues and intellect; bring credit

	the name it bears today. Moreover, the term Coloured children is an
	elastic term. Everyone knows the meaning ofthe expression British
	Indian, but there is no fixed meaning for the term Coloured person,

	distinctions, it is only fair that British Indians should have in
	the largest town in the Colony a school reserved for them. The

	such a mixture. We respectfully submit, however, that it is hardly

As to the question of non-separation of girls and boys, we can only
say, as parents having had considerable experience, and speaking for
Indian sentiment, that the decision is calculated to give rise to
such legitimate complaint. There are not only practical serious
objections to such a course being followed, but in many instances
there is also the religious sentiment to be considered, and we doubt
not that the Government will be pleased to give full consideration to
such sentiments.</p>

Japan has acted generously in waiving more or less two of the
conditions for peace which she had announced. Firstly, she would make
no claims in lieu of war expenses, except that Russia should pay</p>

divided equally between the two countries. Whereas the terms have
spread jubilation among the Russians, they have caused much
dissatisfaction among the Japanese, which shows no signs  of
abatement. The latest cablegrams show that the emissaries of both the
countries are eager to return home, as soon as the terms are
finalized and the treaty signed. Not only do the Japanese envoys not
expect a warm welcome home, but are afraid that the people will look
on them with angry eyes.</p>

In his reply to a question by a Member of Parliament on the above
subject, Mr. Lyttelton had promised to make an inquiry and to put an
end to the flogging. The description of how the Chinese are flogged,
given by <i>The </i><i>Daily Express </i>of Johannesburg, makes
pitiful reading. We give below a summary of the same. The
correspondent says that the facts given by him have been either
personally witnessed by him, or are supported by the evidence of
those who had ordered thousands of men to be flogged. On an average
42 Chinese were flogged in a Johannesburg mine every day, not
excluding even Sundays, towards the beginning of this year. In the
first instance, the Overseer complained against an offending miner,
who was then taken to the office of the Compound Manager; the latter,
in accordance with the nature of the offence, ordered ten, fifteen or
twenty strokes to be administered. Then two Chinese policemen took
him about fifteen steps away; the offender stopped at the policemanâs
word  of command, took off his trousers and other clothes, and lay
with face to the ground; one of the policemen held down the legs of
the offender and the other his head, then the executor of the
punishment beat him mildly or violently, according to orders, on his
back with a wooden stick three feet long and with a flat end three
inches broad. If in the meanwhile, the man made the slightest
movement, unable to bear the pain, another pressed him down with his
foot on his back, and the number of strokes ordered was completed. In
some of the mines, the whip is used instead of the stick<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
and its strokes are so severe that they cause the flesh to swell and
cut the skin. When Mr. Cook was Manager at the Norsedippe mines, he
used to order any Chinaman, who failed to do 36 inches of drilling,
to be punished. His method of punishment was even more cruel than the
one described above. That gentleman ordered the use of stout sticks
and the blows to be given on the back of the thighs where they were
most unbearable; the full number of blows was inflicted even if blood
streamed out from the wounds. Sometimes the injury was so severe that
the poor Chinaman had to be sent to a hospital. One Mr. Place was
later appointed to replace the cruel Mr. Cook. Being considered
rather a gentleman among thieves, he ordered Bubber batons to be used
instead of sticks. After some time the Mine Directors, finding that
the average monthly output did not come up to their expectation,
ordered Mr. Place to use more</p>

force. On his refusing to do so, he was obliged to resign. On the
matter being discussed in the House of Commons, it was ordered that
some other mode of punishment should replace flogging. Thereupon, Mr.
Place, who had experience of conditions in China, introduced a
practice that is prevalent there. He had the offending Chinaman
stripped, then had him tied with his pigtail to a flag-pole standing
in the compound, and made him stand there for two to three hours,
however biting the cold or scorching the sun. Then Mr. Place ordered
other Chinamen to make faces at the offender. Another method of
punishment was to. tie a thin rope to the offenderâs left hand; the
rope was then passed through a ring in such a way that the man was
sus- pended with his toe just touching the ground and kept thus for
two to three hours. At some places, again, the poor miners were
handcuffed and tied to a beam placed two feet above the ground and
kept in that position for a couple of hours in such a way that no
movement was possible. The new punishment was like falling from the
frying-pan into the fire. When punishment by flogging was discussed
in  the House of Commons, the cruel mine officers had stopped the
flogging; but everyone forgot to mention that a more cruel form of
punishment had been substituted.</p>

By exposing this matter, Mr. Peckmann, the Editor of <i>The Daily
Express, </i>has earned the unspoken blessings of hundreds of
Chinese. If all this is true,âand there is no reason to disbelieve
itâwhat answer will the Mine Directors give their Creator? Small
wonder it will be if they are ruined as a result of the curses of the
poor labourers in South Africa. Was it for this that the British
waged war and conquered the Transvaal ?</p>

usual not alive to the situation. There was  no preparation. And just
as  in the Boer War, so in the Crimean War, too, they committed
blunders in the beginning and suffered a crushing defeat. Fifty years
ago, the various facilities for nursing the wounded which are
available today did not exist. People did not come out to render aid
in large numbers as they do now. Surgery was not as efficacious then
as it is today. There were in those days very few men who considered
it an act of mercy and merit to succour the wounded. It was at such a
time that this lady, Florence Nightingale, came upon the scene and
did good work worthy of an angel descended from heaven. She was
heart-stricken to learn of the sufferings of the soldiers. Born of a
noble and rich family, she gave up her life of ease and comfort and
set out to nurse the wounded and the ailing, followed by many other
ladies. She left her home on October 21, 1854. She rendered strenuous
service in the battle of Inkerman<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>.
At that time there were neither beds nor other amenities for the
wounded. There were 10,000 wounded under the charge of this single
woman. The death rate  among the wounded which was 42 per cent.
before she arrived, immediately came down to 31 per cent., and
ultimately to 5 per cent. This was miraculous, but can be easily
visualized. If bleeding could be stopped, the wounds bandaged and the
requisite diet given, the lives of many thousands would doubtless be
saved. The only thing necessary was kindness and nursing, which Miss
Nightingale provided. It is said that she did an amount of work which
big and strong men  were unable to do. She used to work nearly twenty
hours, day and night. When the women working under her went to sleep,
she, lamp in hand, went out alone at midnight to the patientsâ
bedside, comforted them, and herself gave them whatever food and
other things were necessary. She was not afraid of going even to the
battle-front, and did not know what fear was. She feared only God.
Knowing that one has to die some day or other, she readily bore
whatever hardships were necessary in order to alleviate the
sufferings of others.</p>

The latest number of <i>India </i>brings the sad news of the death of
Miss Manning, the energetic Secretary of the National Indian Associa-
tion, which owes its vitality to this noble ladyâs self-
sacrifi-cing work. She was a true friend of young Indians who went to
England for study. Her house was ever open to receive them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

had become an annual feature, and they brought together Anglo-Indians
and Indians and thus promoted mutual goodwill. She was quite
unassuming, and as <i>India </i>states, she avoided rather than
sought public recognition. Her death is a distinct loss to the
ever-increasing number of young Indians who visit England year after
year for study or otherwise. We refer our readers to our London

has put up an admirably tough fight against Lord Curzon in the 
Imperial  Legislature.</p>

Lord Curzon is not pleased with the appointment, by His Highness the
Gaekwad, of Mr. Dutt<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">6 </font></sup>as
his Minister. He has therefore, as The <i>Bengalee </i>reports,
issued a confidential circular to all the Indian princes to the
effect that, if any of them wanted to employ persons who had resigned
from the Indian Civil Service, he should obtain the previous sanction
of the Government. This appears to be one of Lord Curzonâs last

A severe earthquake rocked Calabria<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>in Italy a few days ago rendering thousands of people
homeless and pitiably crying for aid. The King of Italy has donated
Â£4,000 for relief. The numbers of those either dead or seriously
injured are 300 at Parghelly, 200 at Geplo, and 2,000 at Martereno.
The big quake was followed by another mild one after two or three
days. The people are panic-stricken and are running about from place
to place, and some are even leaving the country. It is estimated that
the injured and the dead total 5,000. The earthquake of 1857 which
involved a larger area took a toll of about ten thousand lives.
Calabria has frequently had  such  calamities. During the 75 years
preceding 1857, the total loss of  life  was 1,11,000, giving an
annual average of 1,500 lives. There have been several earthquakes in
Calabria during the last fifty years, but none of them caused so much
damage as the present one. Many villages have been wiped out, and
about a hundred thousand people have been rendered homeless. The
government of the country is trying its utmost to give them all
possible help.</p>

There are many Chinese living in Johannesburg. They cannot be said to
be economically better off than the Indians. Many of them are merely
artisans. A few days ago I had the occasion to observe how they
lived. On seeing their way of life and comparing it with our own,  I
felt very sad.</p>

They have founded the Chinese Association for public work, and for
this purpose, they maintain a spacious hall. It is a strong structure
built of brick and is kept clean and tidy. They meet the expenses for
its maintenance by sub-letting the large plot of land they have taken
out on lease. Since the Chinese have no facilities  for lodging, they
have started a Cantonese Club, which serves as a meeting place, a
lodge and also as a library. They have acquired for the Club land on
a long lease and have built on it a <i>pucca </i>one-storeyed
building. There they all live in great cleanliness and do not stint
themselves in the matter of living space; and seen within and from
outside, it would look like some good European Club. They have in it
separate rooms marked drawing, dining, meeting, committee  room and
the Secretaryâs room and the library, and do not use any room
except for the purpose for which it is intended. Other rooms
adjoining these are let out as bedrooms. It is such a fine and clean
place that any Chinese gentleman visiting the town can be put up
there. The entrance fee is Â£5, and the annual subscription varies
according  to  the membersâ profession. The club has about 150
members who meet every Sunday and amuse themselves with games. The
members can avail themselves of club facilities on week days also.</p>

We have nothing similar to boast of. In no city Of South Africa have
we a place of our own where an Indian visitor can be put up. Our
hospitality is no doubt excellent, but it is bound to be limited. If
we had something like a club, it could be used in a variety of ways.
It would be very profitable if people could spend their leisure hours
at such a public place instead of in one anotherâs homes: no single
person is taxed thereby; friendship grows; and our prestige, too, is
enhanced. The rules of cleanliness also can be better observed. There
is no doubt that this activity is quite essential and can be carried
on without much cost.</p>

The strong movement that is being carried on in Bengal to boycott
British goods is of no mean significance. Such a movement has been
possible there because education is more widespread and the people in
Bengal are more alert than in other parts of India. Sir Henry Cotton
has remarked that Bengal holds sway from Calcutta to Peshawar. It is
necessary to know the reasons for this.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.19cm; line-height: 95%">
There is no gainsaying the fact that a nationâs rise or fall
depends upon its great men. The people who produce good men cannot
but be influenced by them. The main reason for the special
distinction that we find in Bengal is that many great men were born
there during the last century. Beginning with Rammohan Roy<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
one heroic figure after another has raised Bengal to a position
higher than that of the other provinces. It can be said that
Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar was the greatest among them. âVidyasagarâ,
which means an ocean of learning, was an honorific of Ishwarchandra,
conferred on him by the pundits of Calcutta for his profound Sanskrit
learning. But Ishwarchandra was not an ocean of learning only; he was
an ocean of compassion, of generosity, as well as of many other
virtues. He was a Hindu, and a Brahmin too. But to him, Brahmin and
Sudra, Hindu and Muslim, were all alike. In any good deeds that he
performed, he made no distinction between high and low. When his
professor had an attack of cholera, he himself nursed him. As the
professor was poor, Ishwarchandra called in the doctors at his own
cost and  himself attended to the patientâs toilet.</p>

Himself he led a very simple life. His dress consisted of a coarse

Ishwarchandra was born of poor parents in a small village in the
Midnapur <i>taluka</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3</font></sup><i>.
</i>His mother was a very saintly woman, and many of her virtues were
inherited by Ishwarchandra. Even in those days, his father knew some
English, and decided to give his son a better education.
Ishwarchandra began his schooling at the age of five. At the age of
eight, he had to walk sixty miles to Calcutta to join a Sanskrit
college. He had such a prodigious memory that he learnt the English
numerals by looking at the figures on the milestones while walking
along the road. At sixteen he became well versed in Sanskrit, and was
appointed a Sanskrit teacher. Rising step by step, he at last became
the Principal of the College where he had studied. The Govern-ment
held him in great respect. But, being of an independentnature,he
could not adjust himself to the  Director  of Public Instruction and
resigned his post. Sir Frederick Halliday, the Lieutenant-Governor of
Bengal, sent for him and requested him to withdraw his resignation,
but Ishwarchandra flatly declined.</p>

His nobility and humanity had their true blossoming after he had
given up his job. He saw that Bengali was a very good language, but
appeared poor for want of fresh contributions. He, therefore,  began
writing books in Bengali. He produced very powerful books, and it is
mainly due to Vidyasagar that the Bengali language is at present in
full bloom and has spread throughout India.</p>

But he also realised that merely writing books was not enough; and so
he founded schools. It was Vidyasagar who founded the Metropolitan
College in Calcutta. It is staffed entirely by Indians.</p>

replied: âSir, I have never gone to a court of law to get justice
for myself. How, then, is it  possible for me to proceed against
you?â At that time other European gentlemen who used to help
Ishwarchandra in his work rendered him good financial aid. Not being
very rich himself, he often ran into debt by helping others out of
their difficulties; nevertheless, when a proposal was made to raise a
public subscription for him, he turned it down.</p>

He did not rest satisfied with thus putting higher and elementary
education on a sound footing. He saw that, without the education of
girls, the education of boys alone would not be enough. He found out
a verse from Manu which said that the education of women was a duty.
Pressing it into service, he wrote a book on the subject and, in
collaboration with Mr. Bethune founded the Bethune College for
imparting education to women. But it was more difficult to get women
to go to college than to found it. As he lived a saintly life and was
very learned, he was respected by all. So he met prominent people and
persuaded them to send their womenfolk to the College; and thus,
their daughters began to attend the College. Today there are in that
College many well-known and talented women of sterling character, so
much so that they can by themselves carry on its administration.</p>

Still not satisfied, he started schools imparting elementary
education to small girls. Here food, clothing and books were supplied
free of charge. Consequently, one can see  today  thousands  of
educated women in Calcutta.</p>

To meet the need for teachers he started a Teacherâs Training

Seeing the very pitiable condition of Hindu  widows,  he advocated
the remarriage of widows; he wrote books and made speeches on the
subject. The Brahmins of Bengal opposed him, but he did not care.
People threatened to kill him, but he went on undaunted. He got the
Government to pass a law legalizing remarriage of widows. He
persuaded many men and arranged the remarriage of daughters of
prominent men widowed in childhood. He encouraged his own son to
marry a poor widow.</p>

The <i>kulin </i>or high-born Brahmins were given to taking a number
of wives. They were not ashamed of marrying as many as twenty of
them. Ishwarchandra wept to see the sufferings of such women; and he
carried on his effort till the end of his life to eradicate this
wicked custom.</p>

When he saw thousands of poor people in Burdwan suffering from
malaria, he maintained a doctor at his own cost and personally
distributed medicines among them. He went to the houses of the poor
and gave them the necessary help. In this way he worked ceaselessly
for two years, secured government help and called for more doctors.</p>

In the course of this work, he saw the necessity of a knowledge of
medicine. So he studied homeopathy, attained proficiency in it, and
began to prescribe medicines to the sick. He did not mind travelling
long distances in order to help the poor.</p>

He was equally a stalwart in helping big princes out of their
difficulties. If any of them had injustice done to him or was reduced
to poverty, Ishwarchandra used to help him with his influence,
knowledge and money, and mitigate his distress.</p>

While he was engaged in these activities, Vidyasagar passed away in
1890, at the age of seventy. There have been few in this world like
him. It is said that had Ishwarchandra been born among a European
people, an imposing column, like the one raised by the British for
Nelson, would have been erected as a memorial to him. However, a
column to honour Ishwarchandra already stands in the hearts of the
great and the small, the rich and the poor of Bengal.</p>

took place between 1895 and 1899. The increase was considered to be
so alarming that the late President Kruger was urged by some of the
present anti-Indian agitators to take steps, but happily, so far as
Indian immigration was concerned, the late President turned a deaf
ear to any such suggestion. It was in 1896 that India was visited by
the plague followed by two successive famines of extraordinary
dimensions. The largest known exodus from India took  place during
that time. The steamers <i>Courland, </i><i>Naderi, </i><i>Hooseni,
</i>and <i>Crescent </i>were specially run between Bombay and South
African ports, each having on board per voyage over 400 Indians bound
for South Africa. Most of these, it was then a matter of common
knowledge, found their way to the Transvaal.</p>

produced, and yet the original statement has been reiterated. They
have said that it was impossible for British Indians before War to
enter the Transvaal and not be registered. My Association has no
hesitation in saying that the statement is entirely devoid of truth.
Hardly one-third of the people who entered this country were actually
registered, and they were only those who had to take out trade
licences and even then the number did not necessarily include
partners. My Association is in a position to prove from unimpeachable
testimony that there were British Indians in the Transvaal before War
who never paid the registration fee. Some of them are well known and
can be identified by respectable European merchants.</p>

The third statement that has been made is with reference to the
alleged Indian exodus to Potchefstroom from Natal. Those that have
made this statement can know nothing of the conditions of the working
of the Naval laws regarding indentured labourers, and the statement
has been made to the effect that it is men drawn from this class who
have crowded into Potchefstroom. The detractors of Indians have, so
far as my Association is aware, never yet succeeded in introducing
any proof in support of the many statements they have made, and have
never taken into account the great fact that it was Johannesburg
which, before War, supported the largest Indian population, and it is
from Johannesburg that the Indians have now radiated into other parts
of the Colony. The trade in Johannesburg before War, so far as the
Indians were concerned, as it was confined to the Dutch and the
Natives, was very fair. Both the Dutch and Native trade at present
stands at its lowest ebb. The result is that many traders who found
it impossible to eke out a living in Johannesburg have now
established in the different parts of the Transvaal. The Johannesburg
Location supported a large number of Indian landlords. These have not
only been impoverished, but have been obliged to leave Johannesburg
and go to other parts of the Colony. If the original condition of
Johannesburg was resumed and security of tenure re-assured to the
British Indians which they enjoyed before War, most of the Indian
population, which is dispersed over the different areas in the
Colony, would again gravitate to Johannesburg and the anti-Indian
gentlemen would have the satisfaction of knowing that the Indians
have certainly disappeared from the many townships.</p>

The Supreme Court had another opportunity of deciding upon a point
arising out of the Dealersâ Licenses Act of Natal. This time it was
a review of the decision, some time ago published in these columns,
of the Town Council of Durban, confirming that of the Licensing
Officer, who refused to register the transfer of Mr. Hoondamalâs
licence from Grey Street to West Street. The judgment given by the
learned Chief Justice is most disappointing. It may be in accordance
with law but certainly not with justice or equity. The obvious answer
to this is that judges have to interpret and not to make law, but we
respectfully think that it must be a serious state of law if it does
not provide a remedy for an admitted evil. The Licensing Officer has
extensive powers with reference to granting of licences to trade in
the Colony. The learned Chief Justice said that, under the law, he
was not to exercise judicial discretion. It, therefore, amounts to
this, that the Licensing Officer may, in order to spite a personal
enemy, decline to grant him his  licence, and the Courts would be
powerless to intervene. The dividing line between political animus
and personal enmity, so far as such cases are concerned, is very
narrow. The Dealersâ Licenses Act is an administrative enactment.
It is not a political law, in any sense of the term. In not granting
the licence to Mr. Hoondamal, the Licensing Officer has been
undoubtedly guided by political animus against the class to which the
appellant belongs.</p>

Indeed, he has said so in his reason, which is that it was not
advisable to grant further licences to Asiatics in West Street.
However, the mischief is done. The highest tribunal in the country
has felt itself powerless to correct the evil. Every Indian licence
is at stake;  and if there is to be any relief secured, British
Indian merchants must gird up their loins, rise to the occasion, and
carry on ceaseless warfare until the disgraceful Act is blotted out
of the Statute-book. Representations must be made to the Government,
to the local Parlia- ment, and to the Colonial Secretary, inviting
their attention to the matter. If the local Parliament, whose
members, in the words of the late Sir John Robinson, are trustees for
the unrepresented British Indians, would not listen, the India
Office, which is the paramount trustee for the millions of India,
should intervene and induce Natal to grant the very small measure of
justice to which Indians are entitled. The late Mr. Harry Escombe, at
the time of introducing the Bill, said that the success of the
measure would depend upon the moderation with which the powers given
under the Act were used, and that, if the local authorities failed to
exercise their powers moderately, they might have to be taken away.
The Act has been in operation for over eight years, and no one can
deny it has been capriciously enforced  on many an occasion, and it
has always hung like Damoclesâ sword over the heads of the Indian
merchants in the Colony. It is time that the sword was removed, and
that the sufferers were permitted to feel that they are under British
constitutional rule and not under Russian autocracy.</p>

Mr. George Goch, the Mayor of Johannesburg, let himself go, as the
phrase goes, at the meeting recently held in Potchefstroom under the
auspices of the Transvaal Progressive Association. He spoke, not as
simple Mr. Goch holding independent views, but as a representative of
the Progressive Association, and as one bound to express the official
views, whether they coincided with his own conscientious opinions or
not. Mr. Goch, in 1903, was among the few who raised their voices in
favour of British Indians, at the deliberations of the Johannesburg
Municipality. He then considered Asiatic competition to be quite
healthy. He considered the British Indian as a desirable  citizen,
because he was industrious, thrifty and law-abiding. Mr. Goch, the
Mayor of Johannesburg, does not hesitate to retail the falsehoods
that were set in motion by Mr. Loveday and his friends. He does not</p>

white community, whereas only a short time ago he considered them to
be a strength to any community in which they were placed. To him,
Asiatics are, to-day,</p>

Empire, he has the right to their sympathy.</font></font></p>

citizenship. If it consists in giving public entertainments, if it
consists in opening champagne bottles, we must confess that the poor
Asiatic has very little sense of such burden; but if it means a
readiness to comply with the laws of the country, to pay oneâs
taxes, to earn oneâs livelihood by the sweat of oneâs brow
instead of becoming a public charge, to conform to the social laws
relating to morality, to assist in defending oneâs country of
domicile, no matter how or  in  what humble capacity, then we have no
hesitation in saying that the Indian has well discharged the burden
of citizenship. We are afraid, however, that there is no arguing with
people who would wilfully mislead. Mr. Goch knows all that we have
been saying about the Indian, but expediency, an eagerness to snatch
votes, required from him a change of front. Mr. Gochâs example
shows to what pass public life has come under modern conditions. The
gods must be pleased at any cost. Nothing is too sacred to be
sacrificed in order to appease them, and if this is to be the outcome
of popular government, the time is not far distant when it will stink
in the nostrils, and become a byword for hypocrisy and insincerity.</p>

We publish in another column the  correspondence<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">
</font></sup>between Lord Selborne and the British Indian Association
at Johannesburg with reference to the status of British Indians in
the Orange River Colony. Lord Selborneâs reply is extremely
courteous, but equally disappointing. In spite of His Excellencyâs
anxiety and  desire  to soothe British Indians, he has been
undoubtedly led away by the reports from the local officials who have
smartly succeeded in confusing the real issue. The British Indian
Association naturally protested against Indians being classed with
all sorts of Coloured people, including the Natives of South Africa.
It resented the application of regulations aimed at the Natives of
the soil to  the Indians who may go to the Colony. The injustice is
all the more serious because, in practice, very few Indians are
affected, as the application of such legislation to them is not
called for by the circumstances of the case. The utility of the
registration of servants has never been questioned. The regulations
that have been reproduced in these columns from time to time have
been shown to be restrictive of the personal liberty and insulting to
those affected by them. It was of such legislation that the British
Indian Association has rightly complained. What does it get in return
? An illustration, shown from Ceylon, to justify registration of
servants, which has never been questioned! The Association, in its
concluding reply,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">l </font></sup>has
also very properly drawn Lord Selborneâs attention to the fact that
British Indians do expect in the near future to have the right to
enter the Orange River Colony, and if the expectation is justly
entertained, restrictive legislation in anticipation is open to
exception. The matter is one that calls for immediate action, and we
hope that Lord Selborne will be pleased to see that justice is done
to British Indians who have now settled in the Orange River Colony,

We extend a hearty welcome to Mr. Bernard Gabriel, who has just
returned a full-fledged barrister from England. Under ordinary
circumstances, it would be no cause to specially notice a lad
becoming a barrister, but the event in which we are now interested is
very significant. Mr. Gabriel comes of Indian parents who are among
the earliest settlers in the Colony and who are drawn from the
indentured class. It reflects the highest credit on them that they
and their elder sons sacrificed almost all they had in order to give
their youngest son a sound education. It speaks well for their public
spirit and parental love. They have raised the poor Indians, who for
their livelihood have to serve under indenture, in the estimation of
all right-thinking men. Mr. Bernard Gabriel has also shown that,
under the circumstances, the children of poor Indians are capable of
attaining to a high degree of proficiency, and we think that the
Colonists, too, ought to take pride in the event. There is another
aspect. Whilst, as an Indian, Mr. Bernard Gabriel has every right to
congratulate himself on being a barrister in legal education, he has
to recognise the fact that his career is only commencing. He has to
consider himself as trustee for his fellow young men in the same walk
of life, and it is his example which, if well set, will induce other
parents to send their children to England to finish their education.
He has adopted an honourable profession, but if it be used as a means
for amassing wealth, there may be failure staring him in the face. If
his attainments are placed at the service of the community, they will
grow more and more. We hope, therefore, that Mr. Gabriel has brought
with him a real knowledge of the traditions of his profession, and
that in all he does he will be prudent, calm, humble and patriotic.</p>

Recently the Permit Office has introduced a regulation to the effect
that persons seeking permits can get them only on furnishing the
names of two Europeans for reference. This is outrageous. The
Association has made a strong representation against it. It has been
stated therein that there could be very few cases where a European
would know Indians by name. The making of such a regulation only
means that the Government does not intend to allow any more Indians
to enter the Transvaal. This regulation will, moreover, encourage
fraudulent practices; for many dishonest Europeans will come forward
who will not hesitate to take a false oath for the sake of money. So
far only 12,000 Indians have entered the Transvaal. Before the war
their number was 15,000. Hence there is reason to believe that 3,000
more of the former residents are still to return. They are suffering
many hardships, and it is the duty of the Government to admit them
without delay. The permit Officer had forwarded the petition to H. E.
the Lieutenant-Governor, who wanted to know the grounds on which it
had been stated that there were 15,000 Indians before the war. In its
reply the Association has submitted the following grounds :</p>

It would not be surprising if those who entered the Transvaal between
1895 and 1899 were to number 10,000. Thousands of men left India,
because of the plaque in 1896 and the severe famine in 1897-8. Again
stringent-laws were enacted in Natal in 1897. All this resulted in
many Indians entering the Transvaal. Though there was at that time
alien rule in the Transvaal, Indians could freely enter the country.
The late Mr. Kruger did not listen to the suggestion that this be
stopped. At the time, four steamships, <i>the Naderi</i>, the
<i>Courland</i>, the <i>Hooseni</i>, and the <i>Crescent </i>used to
ply between Bombay and South Africa, and each of them brought
hundreds of Indians to  South Africa. Each of the steamers made four
trips a year, and calculating at the rate of three hundred passengers
per trip, the sixteen trips in a year</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always"><a name="380. LETTER TO CHHAGANLAL GANDHI"></a>

Besides laying this evidence before the Government, the Association
has also shown the statements of Mr. Loveday<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

the Government to pay no attention to them and immediately admit the
poor Indians that still remain stranded outside.</p>

Your letter to hand. What you write bout Kitchin is astounding. You
have nothing to do with his temperament. He is not your boss. You can
certainly reply to what he says without losing your temper. You are
both equals, and can discuss matters as such. When I say, âYou
should tolerate him whatever he might sayâ, it does not mean that
you should not reply; it only means that you should not get excited
while opposing his statements. I know the West incident. There the
mistake was mine. I had asked him to go to Kitchin; but I forget the
fact that the venerable Mr. Kitchin cannot tolerate anybodyâs
presence. This is his shortcoming which we should ignore.</p>

You have arranged Manilalâs time-table very well. Since he likes

I see  that  your  mind has  weakened a  little. The real need is for
you to stay here with me for a few months, which, however, does not
seem to be possible. It is not enough that you are firm about staying
on in the press. I have  already  shown you  conclusively as in  a
mathematical problem that the press wonât break down. You had
agreed with me in that, and now you write that the circumstances are
unbearable and precarious. This is exactly what I consider a sign of
weakness. You have not been able to considerânor did you have the
time to do soâwhat our duty is in regard to the  press,  what  your
 own duty is or how to deal with the workers; and your weakness is
brought out by the adverse circumstances. I consider it a good thing
that this has happened; but it can be so considered onlyif you
understand the purport of it. I cannot explain all this in a letter.
But this much I do say that: (1) the press will not break down so
long as even a single man is entirely devoted to it; (2) I do not see
anything better for you or the others than the press; (3) however
bitter a man might be, he is sure to come round if we bestow upon him
pure love in thought, word and deed; (4) but, whether he comes round
or not, our duty is to follow the same course without misgivings. I
believe it will be better if you train Hemchand and free yourself a
little. And I want you to do so.</p>

Orchard writes to me saying that you gave Ram directly an  order for
binding a book, and he complains that, if he is the foreman, this was
irregular. He also states the book is not well bound. I have written
to him saying that if you have done so, the giving of the order
directly is irregular, but that you could not possibly have meant any
offence to him or to break the rules, and I have also asked him to
have a man-to-man conversation with you. I should, therefore, like
you to have a chat with him and let me know also what this is about.

Although Sir Richard-Solomon, the Attorney-General for the Transvaal,
stated that no contentious legislation would be introduced during the
present session of the Transvaal Legislative Council, the latest
<i>Government Gazette </i>to hand gives a list of ordinances passed
by the dying Council, some of which are without doubt highly
contentious, if, that is to say, the feelings of those whom they are
intended to affect are of any consequence. There is, for instance,
the Municipal Amending Ordinance which gives any Town Council in the
Transvaal the power âwith the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor
to close any Locations for Natives established or laid out by it or
under its controlâ, provided that the Lieutenant-Governor may,
before giving his approval to the closing of such Location, require
the Council to lay out other land suitable for a Location. It makes
further provision for compensation to be paid to the Natives for the
value of their huts, etc. Section 10 gives the Council the power to
set apart and maintain Asiatic Bazaars, and it makes the provision
with reference to Native Locations above referred to applicable to
the Asiatic Bazaars, which means that there is only this distinction
between the two, namely, that, whereas Natives may be compelled to
reside in the Location, Asiatics may not be compelled to remove to
the  Locations, which are euphemistically described as Bazaars. This
legislation regarding Asiatic Bazaars arises from the struggle of the
Pretoria Municipality for obtaining control over the Asiatic Bazaars
at Pretoria. In theory, there may be no difference between
governmental and municipal control; but, in practice, it will very
largely depend upon the temper of the municipality that may happen to
be in authority. Instead, therefore, of there being a continuity of
policy regarding Bazaars, there will now be differences in accordance
with the fancy of each municipality. It is very difficult to know why
such legislation has been passed during the last days of the existing
Coun- cil, in view of the fact that the whole of the Asiatic question
is still a matter of correspondence between the Home Government and
the Transvaal Government. Many more important and pressing matters
have been naturally held in abeyance, in view of the establishment
next year of an elective Council. The amending ordinances, however,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
authorise the municipalities to impose licences for tea-rooms or
eating-houses which may be used exclusively by Asiatics. For this, we
believe the Asiatics in the Transvaal have to thank some Chinese
store-keepers, who, in their eagerness to open Chinese eating-houses
and not knowing that licences were not required for them, petitioned
the Government to let them have facilities for opening such
eating-houses. The Government have met the petitioners with what they
deserve, and all Asiatic boarding-housekeepers will now have the
pleasure of having municipal control over even small Asiatic
refreshment rooms. Municipal control, for the sake of sanitation, we
can quite understand and even welcome; but the imposing of licences
over businesses which we apprehend are hardly lucrative, so far as
British Indians are concerned, is simply preposterous. But British
Indians are Asiatics; therefore, if there must be eating-house
licences imposed for the catering of 45,000 Chinamen, the Transvaal
Government argue there must also be licences imposed for
eating-houses for 12,000 Indians. It did not occur to them that
Indian eating-houses are very rare, as the custom of the community
does not as a rule require them. Indeed, they are so few that
hitherto they have not been even noticed.</p>

There is, again, the Revenue Licence Ordinance which requires hawkers
and pedlars to take out certificates from magistrates, Justices of
the Peace, or Police Officers before being entitled to a licence,
exception being made in favour of those who may be already in
possession of their licences, provided that these fortunate men,
within fourteen days before the expiry of their licences, hand them
to the Revenue Officers within their districts.</p>

Among the lands thus dealt with is the Malay Location in
Johannesburg. This Location has been in existence for the last twelve
years or more. There has never been any objection raised to it either
on account of the habits of the inhabitants or its situation. The
inhabitants, under a sense of security fostered by the different
British Agents who represented the Government before the war, have
built substantial houses. The tenure, however, from a legal
standpoint is only a monthly tenancy. What, then, are the inhabitants
to receive as</p>

compensation, assuming that they will be removed ? We cannot but here
recall the invidious distinction that has been drawn between one
portion of Vrededorp and the other portion, for the whole of the
Malay Location is part of Vrededorp. That portion which is inhabited
by the old indigent burghers has received most favourable treatment
at the hands of the Government. As our readers must have seen from
these columns, they are not only not to be dispossessed but they are
to have their monthly tenure converted into long leases. Why should
not the same facility be given to the inhabitants of the Malay
Location? It will be for the latter to see to their rights being
properly safeguarded. These are only a few samples of legislation
which has been termed non-contentious. It has in some shape or other
dealt with the rights of the Coloured people who have no choice
whatsoever in their government.</p>

The provision is very drastic. The Restriction Act has  been passed
in the supposed interests of the Colony. It is quite conceivable that
a man may unwittingly enter it in contravention of the Act. It is
hardly just, then, if he is found to be in possession of just enough
to pay the cost of his removal to make him bear the burden. Although
ignorance of law is in theory held to be no excuse, there are,
perhaps, cases in which in practice ignorance is a valid plea. There
is already in the Act a clause requiring the masters of all steamers
that may bring Prohibited Immigrants to take them back. If a
Prohibited Immigrant enter the Colony, it shows also lack of
supervision on the part of the authorities, and it seems hardly fair
that an innocent man should be punished, either because there is not
complete supervision at the Cape,</p>

Â£5,000,000. This has led the American traders and merchants to urge
their Government to abolish the anti-Chinese laws<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>.
To counter this move, the working classes there have held large
meetings and passed resolutions demanding that the anti-Chinese laws
should not be repealed, whatever the loss they might cause to the
traders. Thus, on the one hand, there is a split between the traders
and the working classes in America, and on the other, the cablegrams
received from China show that the Chinese boycott is gathering
strength. This resolution by the Chinese is sought to be applied to
all the places where anti-Chinese laws are in force. Moreover, it is
also said that the feeling against the whites has become so strong in
China that fears are being entertained about the safety of those
residing in the interior. It is difficult to say what all this
agitation will lead to.</p>

The great advances said to have been made in the nineteenth century
are now being put to the test in the twentieth. And it would appear
that the present century might witness great upheavals. In all this
commotion one thing stands out clear, namely, that where there is
unity, there alone is strength, and also victory. This deserves to be
carefully borne in mind by every Indian. The Chinese, though weak,
appear to have become strong on account of their unity, thereby
bearing out the truth of the Gujarati verse, âThus do ants when
united take the life of a fierce snakeâ.</p>

In his Annual  Report,  Mr.  Mudie,  Superintendent  of Education in
Natal, states that  sufficient attention  is  not  being paid  to the
cleanliness of children in the schools for Indians and other Coloured
people. This comment by Mr. Mudie deserves careful consideration.
Though Mr. Mudie is not one of our well-wishers, we ought to ponder
over our shortcomings when he points them out to us. Parents should
give enough attention to this matter. Though we may not ourselves
observe rules of cleanliness, it  is  very  essential  to teach them
to our children. If they learn to follow them, muchimprovement is
likely to result in the course of a generation. The following points

We find from the Johannesburg newspapers that the season for epidemic
fever has set in there. The Municipality has issued a public notice
that those who keep their latrines unclean will be prosecuted. The
local rules require that after a person has used a latrine, he should
spread dry dust, ashes or some disinfectant powder over the faeces so
as to cover them over completely. The latrine should not be wet or
smelly. Any default in this respect is punishable with a fine up to
Â£5. This is a very good rule. Ashes or dry dust can be had free of
charge. We earnestly appeal to our readers to keep a tin filled with
dust in the latrine and cover the faeces with dust or ashes.</p>

George who one day cut off, for the fun of it, a berry plant that was
dear to his father. When he saw the fate of the plant, his father
asked the boy about it. George replied: âFather, I wouldnât tell
a lie. I cut the plant.â When the father, who questioned him in an

the first sixteen years of his life. Until then he had read little.
Later, he was appointed manager of some estate. While on this job, he

army.</p>

At this time North America was under British rule, and quarrels were
going on between England and the American people.  The  people in
America did not like certain taxes imposed on them by England. There
were other matters also that troubled the Americans. Consequently,
the feelings between the people of America and those of England ran
high and resulted in war. The English armies were trained and well
equipped, while the Americans were simple, rustic folk. They were not
conversant with the use of arms. They were not accustomed to working
in the disciplined manner of an army and suffering hardships.
Washington was called upon to control such men and exact work from
them, so that America could  become independent and free from the
British yoke. The people made him Commander-in-Chief. Washington
protested: âI do not deserve this honour, but since you are pleased
to appoint me to the post, I accept it in an honorary capacity with a
view to serving the people.â This was no mere formal sentiment, for
he sincerely believed that he was not sufficiently capable and wrote
in similar terms to his personal friends. But once the responsibility
was entrusted to him, he braved  all  dangers, worked day and night,
and so impressed the people that they began to act upon his word even
before it was spoken and faced any danger they were asked to. The
result was that the English armies were defeated, and America became
independent. And once the task was accomplished, Washington
relinquished his post. But the people had found in him a gem which
they would not part with. So, when the American Republic was founded
in 1787, George Washington was elected its first President. Even when
he assumed this high office, he never thought of using it to gain
selfish ends. At the end of a war, it always happens that false
patriots come forward to fill their pockets. But all such people had
to live in awe of Washington. In 1792-3<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Washington was elected President for a second time.
During his term of office, he showed the same courage and bravery
that he had displayed in war in introducing land reforms, in keeping
the people united and in enhancing the countryâs reputation. A
writer has said: âWashington was first in war, as well as first in

This heroic person died of a sudden illness on December 14, 1799. He
was very tall; his height, it is said, was six feet three inches. No
one in his time had such massive arms. He was always humble and kind.
The high position to which America has risen today is due to his
patriotism.The name of Washington will live as long as America lives.
May India too produce such heroes.</p>

	Whilst every attempt is being made in South Africa  to discourage
	Indian education, signs are not wanting to show that in India itself
	the desire for education has taken deep root in the hearts of the
	people, and that, before many years are out, we may even find
	compulsory education adopted in the advanced parts of India.
	Macaulay penned the famous Education Minute in l836.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
	</font></sup>It was then that Indian education received its real
	impetus, and yet âin the census of 1901, it was found that only
	one in ten of the female population were literateâ. Mr. H. D.
	Kantavala, the Director of Pu-  blic Instruction in the State of
	Baroda, contributes a very valuable paper to <i>East </i><i>and </i><i>West
	</i>for August. According to our authority, the number of students
	of all grades in 1901 was 3,268,726, and the expenditure incurred on
	the education of these students was less than two crores of rupees,
	that is, one-and-a-third million pounds. Of this amount, a little
	over one-fourth was spent on primary education. The expenditure on
	education represents 1.5 per cent. of the total revenue of
	Government. It is admitted that primary education has not received
	sufficient attention in India, and the main reason is that  the
	Government of India has found it impossible to spend more owing to
	lack of funds. We will not at present go into the question of why
	money has not been available for further development of education,
	but we may say that the matter no longer remains absolutely in the
	hands of the Government.</p>

Baroda in compulsory education that Mr. Kantavala has largely dealt

With characteristic energy, and undaunted by serious difficulties of
a complex nature, Mr. Kantavala selected a group of ten villages, the
most backward in the State (as it was the Gaekwarâs intention to
see the working of the system at its worst), and enforced the
principles above laid down. Several interviews which the Director of
Education had with headmen, how he lived down all opposition, how he
brought round to his way of thinking the recalcitrant spirits, are
all very interesting incidents. We would, however, state the result
only in the writerâs own language:</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">It
was thus that I was able to introduce compulsory education in the
most backward part of the Baroda State within a very short time. I
had to pay special attention for months in order to work out the
scheme successfully. By the end of the year, almost all children
within the age of compulsion, that is, over 99 per cent. entered
school, a result which, even in England and other advanced countries,
is not achieved. The successful working of themeasure induced His
Highness to extend compulsory education by taking up fresh groups of
ten villages at a time. Compulsory education in the Amreli Taluka has
stood the test of more than a dozen years, showing always that nearly
cent. per cent. of the children attend the school, and that people
have never raised any complaint of a serious nature against it. His
Highness has recently sanctioned a scheme for applying to two parts
of his territories the law of compulsory education to those children
whose parents have a certain annual income.</font></font></p>

This is a remarkable achievement, and yet it is only a little germ,
when we consider the illiterate millions in India. No one can
foretell to what stature the germ will grow in course of time. The
experiment is not without its lesson to us in South Africa. It is but
right that we should expect the different governments to provide
suitable education for Indian children. It is the duty of those
Indians who are better situated and who see the advantages of
education to see that, if the governments in South Africa will not
help them, they themselves make suitable provision for the education
of Indian children.</p>

Our Indian exchanges bring news with reference to the meetings held
to commemorate the eighty-first birthday of Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, the
Grand Old Man of India, on the 4th September last. Public meetings
were held all over India. The services rendered by Mr. Naoroji to
India, in our humble opinion, are far greater than the services
rendered by Englandâs Grand Old Man<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>to England. Mr. Naorojiâs work has been pioneer work,
and when he commenced it, few indeed were his helpers. The
self-sacrificing devotion with which he has pushed forward the cause
of India, in season and out of season, has hardly any parallel in
India; and it is no wonder that he stands unequalled by any one in
the estimation of  millions  of  his countrymen. The spectacle of an
old man of over eighty years wooing  a British constituency, not for
the sake of glory or honours, but in order that he may serve India
the more, is most pathetic and mag- nificent. If the electors of
North Lambeth send Mr. Naoroji to the new Parliament, they will have
done themselves a unique honour. We echo the prayers that were
offered by the millions in India for long life and health to Mr.
Naoroji.</p>

It is with great regret that we notice the insult that has been
offered to Sir Mancherji Bhownaggree at Calcutta recently. Because he
differed from the [common] opinion on the Partition of Bengal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
he was burnt in effigy on College Square. Sir Mancherji may surely
hold his own opinion, even though it is seldom allowed nowadays to
individual members of that temple of freedomâthe British House of
Commons. To offer such flagrant insult to a member of that assembly,
who has proved his zeal in the cause of India, is unwise; nay, it is
stupid. Indians may not always see eye to eye with Sir Mancherji, but
they cannot fail to acknowledge that he is ever loyal to his native
India and that he has always her interests at heart. Indians in South
Africa will especially feel this insult; for he has proved himself a
true friend to the unrepresented thousands here. Indians will do very
wrong to value a man according to the power of his invective and the
bitterness of his denunciation of Britainâs perfidy. The more
moderate opinions of a man like Sir Mancherji have far greater weight
than the extravagances of hot-headed Radicals. It is the conviction
of calm reasoning alone that will get the full measure of justice for
India; and for this reason Sir Mancherji is, of all men, the least
deserving of the ingratitude of his fellow-countrymen.</p>

From cables and Indian papers recently to hand, it is evident that
the boycott movement in Bengal is not destined to fizzle out in an
in- glorious fashion. Though there appears to be a deal of mob-law in
preventing persons from buying British goods, the movement is so
general as to show that it results from deep feeling on the part of
the people. Whatever may be the result of the present agitation
against the Partition, the effect of the boycott will be productive
of only good to India. It has resulted in a wonderful stimulation of
native industries which, we trust, will grow more and more. It is a
result unlooked for, but not the less eminently desirable. The great
need of India is that</p>

The news of Dr. Barnardoâs death last month has been cabled
throughout the world. Our readers must be eager to know who this Dr.
Barnardo was. We are, therefore, giving this time in these columns an
account of the worthy doctorâs life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; line-height: 95%">
Dr. Barnardo was regarded as the father of orphans and waifs. In his
early years the doctor felt deeply depressed whenever he happened to
see an orphan. But he had then no means of helping them. Although he
was poor, the idea occurred to him that he should undertake to bring
up orphans and thus earn his own livelihood.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; line-height: 95%">
As the Gujarati saying, âgiving a needle in charity after stealing
an anvilâ, goes, we want first to earn plenty of money and then
spend it on some good cause. The entire lives of many are spent in
the process of amassing wealth. Some others forget their  original
resolution when they have earned enough, yet others, when they have
amassed money, do not know how to use it properly, waste it on all
sorts of things and feel satisfied that they have spent it well.
Never having been benevolent, they cannot use the money properly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The intelligent Dr. Barnardo had seen all this. So  he  told himself:
âMy heart is pure; those who trust me and give me money will also
realise that I too must support myself with it. At the same time, if
I undertake to shelter and bring up orphans, I shall earn their
blessings and the people, too, will see that I have no intention of
making money for myself.â With these thoughts in his mind, the
brave doctor plunged into the work, and opened the first Home for
orphan-waifs at Steveny-Causeway in London. People at first opposed
him, many saying that he had only found a fine way of making money by
deceiving the public. Dr. Barnardo, however, was not to be
discouraged. He collected money from those who trusted him. By and
by, more and more children began to flock to his Home. Instead of
becoming vagabonds, they became studious, honest and industrious and
secured employment. All the children thus brought up served as good
publicity for Dr. Barnardoâs Home. They saw that Dr. Barnardo
looked after them better than their own parents would have done. The
doctor founded more such Homes, till at last he established a colony</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always"><a name="401. AN. INDIAN POET"></a>
for orphans in a wood, six miles away from London. There he put up
fine buildings, churches, etc., and the place has now become  so 
famous that many people visit it and feel they are on a pilgrimage;
and in course of time similar homes have been founded in many parts
of the world. Dr. Barnardo himself brought up in this way during his
lifetime 55,000 homeless children. There were some wicked parents who
took unfair advantage of the facility provided by the doctor. They
quietly left their children at night in Dr. Barnardoâs backyard and
went away. Undaunted, the doctor brought them up with careand
returned them to their parents when they claimed them. Every year, in
the big Albert Hall in London, a fair is held in which the children
from these Homes take part and thousands of people pay to visit it.
It has come to be known after the doctorâs death that he had
insured his life for Â£70,000. He has enjoined in his will that all
this money should be spent on the maintenance of the Homes founded by
him.</p>

Such was this great man, Dr. Barnardo. He was pious and very kind.
Though acts like insuring oneâs life, etc., do not accord well with
our idea of religion, it was according to Western practice wise on
the part of the doctor to have done what he did.</p>

Dr. Barnardo has provided us, during the present age, a very good
example of what a poor man could accomplish by dint of enthusiasm and
kindness.</p>

By his English translations of the poems of Hali, Mr. Ward has made
the poet widely known. It is said that there is no other poet who can
equal him. His full name is Maulvi Sayed Altaf Hussain Ansari. He was
born in Panipat, near Delhi. Most of his poems are in Urdu, though he
has written quite a lot in Persian also. The poem he wrote on the
occasion of the Jubilee of 1887<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>was so excellent that it resounded throughout North
India. His works do not concern themselves with the pleasures of
life, but with such useful themes as the duty of Muslims in the
present age, the way both Hindus and Muslims should acquit
themselves, and the way to know God. Sheth Abdul Kadar of Lahore
tells us how during their school days he and his mates used to read
Haliâs poems, how they read them also when</p>

tells us that they listen to them even now at their <i>anjumans</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup><i>,

again. He has written in very eloquent language of the life of the
great poet Sheikh Saadi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
Writing about the work of the poet Hali, Prof. Morrison says: âWhat
this poor poet has done unaided for the community far surpasses what
the wealthy Muslims have done with their money.â In appreciation of
the services rendered by the poet to the community, the Government
have conferred on him the title of <i>Shams-ul-Ulema. </i>We are
sorry we do not have with us his Urdu poems, but we recommend that
our readers obtain and read them.</p>

The difficulties that we labour under in Potchefstroom are common to
British Indians all over the Transvaal. A charge has been laid<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>against British Indians in Potchefstroom as to their
mode of life and the manner in which their business premises are
kept. We would venture respectfully to invite Your Excellencyâs
inspection of the premises<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3
</font></sup>and form your own conclusions about them. We are most
anxious, so far as it is possible, to conform to local customs, and
to conciliate popular sentiment. All we ask for is freedom of
locomotion, trade, residence, and ownership of property under such
general sanitary and other regular general regulations as may be
necessary without introducing class legislation.</p>

Did we not know that what has been called the anti-Asiatic Vigilance
Society is to make representations to Your Excellency with reference
to the British Indians, so far as regards Potchefstroom, we would not
have given any trouble whatsoever to Your Excellency, especially as
we are aware that Your Excellency is to meet very shortly  a
deputation of the British Indian Association at Johannesburg.</p>

Mr. Loveday it was who stated that Potchefstroom was being inundated
with indentured Indians from Natal. To this we beg to give an
emphatic contradiction. Some of us know the Natal laws, and we [know
that it] is next to impossible for an indentured Indian to escape. In
any case not a single instance has been brought forward to prove the
statement above referred to.</p>

Another statement was made by the Mayor of Johannesburg when he was
here. He is reported to have said that, whereas there were nineteen
licences issued to Asiatics before the war, now there were ninety-six
tradersâ licences and thirty-seven hawkersâ licences. This
statement, so far as traders are concerned, is not true. We supplied
before the war a list of British Indian traders in the town of
Potchefstroom to the British Agent, and there were twenty-two British
Indian stores in the town of Potchefstroom, as distinguished from the
district. We have a true copy of the list that was sent to the
British Agent, and we are to-day in a position, not only to give the
names, but to locate each of the store-keepers. Seeing that Mr. Goch

ninety-six tradersâ licences in connection with the nineteen before

present day. We state this with a full sense of responsibility and

A third statement that has been made against us in Potchefstroom is
with reference to the so-called insanitary condition of our dwellings

was made, we took the opportunity of showing our places to the
District Surgeon of Potchefstroom, and the following is the report

We mention these things to show under what disadvantages we have to
labour, and what misrepresentations are made against us. We have no
hesitation in saying that the whole of the anti-Asiatic agitation is
due to trade jealousy. Nothing can be further from our wish than to
enter into an unfair competition with the white store-keepers.</p>

Much has been said against our mode of life. We are proud to think
that we are sober and simple in our habits, and if thereby we have an
advantage over the rival white traders, we hardly think that it
should be brought up against us in order to traduce and degrade us.
It is totally forgotten, in this connection, by those who denounce
us, that the white traders have other advantages which we cannot
dream of having, namely, their European connection, their knowledge
of the English language, and their better organising powers.
Moreover, we are able to carry on our trade only because of the
goodwill of the poor whites, and our ability to please the poorest
class of customers; also, we have the support of wholesale European
houses. It has been said that our competition resulted in many
European shops being closed. We deny this. In the first instance,
some of the shops that have been closed were not shops with which we
could possibly enter into</p>

competition, for instance, hairdressers and others. Some general
goods stores have undoubtedly closed, but to connect their closing
with Asiatic competition would be [as] unfair as to connect the
closing of several Asiatic shops with European competition in this
town. There is trade depression all over South Africa, and it has
only resulted in getting rid of overtrading that was indulged in soon
after the war, based, as it was, on high expectations which have
never been fulfilled.</p>

May we also, in this connection, state that much of the agitation
against us is kept up not by <i>bona-fide </i>British subjects but by
aliens who can have very little indeed to complain of against us. The
policy adopted to drive us out of the township is a policy of
irritation and insults which, though petty in themselves, are galling
enough to be very much felt by us.</p>

Without the slightest occasion, we are now served at special counters
in the Post Office. We are debarred from having a breath of fresh air
in a park which is called a âpublicâ park, and which is kept up
from rates which we are called upon to pay in common with other

attention to the awkward position in which we are placed without any
fault of ours. No opportunity is missed of degrading us and
humiliating us. We do not wish to burden Your Excellency with such
other instances. We have a right, we submit, to expect the British
Government to protect us from such humiliation, and insure for us

His Excellency the High Commissioner has made, during his tour in the
Transvaal, two very important speeches on the status of the British
Indians in that Colony. His speech at Potchefstroom, which will be
found in another column, is the more important. Lord Selborne has
shown therein that, during his short stay, he has studied the
question. He holds the honour of the Government very dear to him, and
recognises the fact that there were promises made to British</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 101%; page-break-before: always">
Indians before the war which have to be carried out. His Lordship,
weare further glad to notice, interprets the Indiansâ Proclamation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>as an assurance of the rights of Indians as full British
subjects all the world over. For all this, and a great deal more, we
are truly thankful to His Excellency. When there is such an evident
desire to hold the scales evenly between conflicting interests, there
is every ground for hope that, in the near future, a solution will be
found for this difficult problem which will be generally accepted.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 86%">
One thing, however, that Lord Selborne is reported to have promised,
fills us with disquiet. These are the reported words:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 105%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">No
Indians who were not here before the war will be admitted into the
country till you have your own parliament, and by your own
representatives you can express your own opinion. I give you that
assurance as your Governor and your High Commissioner.</font></font></p>

We are sure that His Excellency could not have, at the time of making
the promise, measured the full consequence of its operation. His
Excellency is anxious to draw the distinction between Indians already
settled in the country and those who may come hereafter. He impressed
upon his audience the necessity of giving fair treatment to the old
Indian settlers. Now the fact that Indian merchants must draw upon
India for confidential clerks, managers, and other trustworthy
servants has only to be mentioned to convey conviction. It is
well-nigh impossible for them to continue to do business with any
degree of safety without such facilities. Are we, then, to understand
that, unless the incoming Transvaal Parliament chooses to do
otherwise, Indian businesses are to be starved into surrender for
want of reliable men?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">
His Excellency says again that it is not practical statesmanship to
allow Indians to compete with white men without restriction. We have
often discussed this proposition in these columns, and we think we
have shown how hollow it is. For that which is true in it has been
admitted by the Indians, and that which is not true arises only from
pure trade jealousy. The soundness of the Indian position must be
apparent to any but the most prejudiced man, when it is explained
that, with proper safeguards, new Indian licences may be granted only
at the option of the local boards, which consist largely of traders.
But the anti-Asiatic agitators, who are bent on driving every Indian
out of the Colony, will not be satisfied until they succeed in making
his life totally unbearable. It is against attempts such as these
that the Indians have a right to expect Lord Selborne to protect
them.</p>

Today Lord Selborne arrives in Durban, having spent most of the week
in Natal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>. In
common with the rest of the community, we most heartily give our
humble Welcome. Lord Selborne has been in South Africa only a short
while, but already he has gained the confidence of all sections of
the people that he will do his duty to everyone without Ear or
favour. In many ways, His Excellency will find Natal different from
the sister-Colonies. Natal presents some interesting problems for
study, in that it has a large Native population with a comparatively
small white population, which is dependent for the chief industries
under As control upon a large indentured Indian population. The
presence of the latter has naturally attracted to the Colony Indians
of the trading class. We trust that, during his short stay, Hi
Excellency be able to give stay of hi valuable time to a study of the
British Indians in Natal who form by common consent one of the most
loyal and law-abiding sections of Hi Majestyâs subjects. And we
hope with the rest of the community that His Excellency and family
will enjoy their visit to the Garden Colony and carry with them
pleasant recollections.</p>

Plague has come to stay. It is the annual messenger which, year after
year, comes as a warning against darkness, filth  and overcrowding.
Wherever it has once appeared, it has hitherto unfailingly reappeared
with more or less regularity. News has arrived that it has travelled
as far as Chinde<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
From there to Durban is not a far cry. It, therefore, behoves every
good citizen to take the necessary precautions to ward off the Send.
There should be no disguising of the fact that Indians are  more 
susceptible  to  the  ravages of plague than other communities, even
as are the whites more liable to catch typhoid fever than the
Indians. The latter,  therefore, have to be doubly careful. All the
surroundings of dwelling-houses and business premises should be kept

This great man was born in Ceylon on June 28, 1806. As he was born in
the city of Matara<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
in jest, his mother called him âthe Jewel of Mataraâ, and he
proved to be a real jewel indeed. In 1823 he went to Calcutta, where
he got employment in the Bengal Artillery. The first responsible work
entrusted to him was during the First Burmese War<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
While discharging his duty during that war, he fell  ill  and  had 
to go to England where, instead of passing his time in sports and
amusements, he devoted it to study. He returned to India in 1830, and
rejoined his battalion. He then studied Hindustani and Persian. He
spent all  his free time in solitude. One of his r easons for doing
so was that he wanted to save as much money as possible for his
mother. In the meanwhile, he was appointed to a very important and
responsible post, where he fully utilized the knowledge he had 
acquired during his illness in England. The work entrusted to him was
that of carrying out a survey in the North-West Province for  the
purpose of levying taxes from the people there. The real merits of
Lawrence came to be known then. Though a soldier, he had a very
tender and merciful heart. The survey work brought him into close
contact with the poor, and this enabled him to understand the
feelings and the manners and customs of the people. He became one of
them</p>

and mixed freely with them. As he was very hard-working and
persevering, the idlers under him hated him. He did not hesitate to
use compulsion against shirkers. Once it happened that one of the
survey officers committed a blunder, to rectify which Lawrence
ordered him to visit the place again. As the place was ten miles
away, the surveyor hesitated to go. He was thereupon sent there in a
litter. But despite this the man obstinately refused to work. So
Lawrence made himsit on a mango tree, and posted two guards below
with drawn swords. When the surveyor felt very thirsty and hungry, he
begged pardon of Lawrence, agreed to do the work, and sought his
permission to get down. After this the man shed this obstinate habit
and began to do very good work under Lawrence.</p>

We have heard that in the days of old, a brother was often ready to
die for a brother, a friend for a friend, a mother for a son, sons
for parents and a wife for her husband. But Lawrence  acted  in  this
manner in modern times. His elder brother had been taken prisoner in
the Afghan War, and was released on parole for a few days by the
Pathan Chief. He was bound to return after the period of parole was
over. Considering that his brotherâs services were more useful,
Lawrence offered to take his place in the prison. Although the
brother refused to agree to the proposal, Lawrence as good as did it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 95%">
While Lawrence was serving as ambassador in Nepal, his kind- hearted
wife spent her days in good works. At that time the two together
erected, at their own expense, a big building at the foot of the
Himalayas for bringing up and educating the sons of European
soldiers. Similar institutions have since been built all over India,
and all of them have been called Lawrence Asylums. In the Sikh War of
1846 Lawrence showed great valour. He readily complied with the
orders to join active service within twenty-four hours,  leaving  his
ailing wife behind. After the War, he did very good work as Her
Majestyâs representative in Lahore, for which knighthood  was
conferred upon him. When in 1849 it was proposed to annex the Punjab,
Lawrence alone opposed it and stood up to a Governor-General of the
calibre of Lord Dalhousie. Though he did not succeed, the
Governor-General had so much confidence in him that he entrusted the
main responsibility for work in the Punjab to him. For he had earlier
come into very close contact with the Sikhs who greatly loved and
admired him. It is because of this that the Punjab was pacified.</p>

Mutiny of 1857. By that time his health had broken down and  he  had
already been sanctioned leave. But on the outbreak of the Mutiny, he
at once proceeded to Lucknow  instead  of  availing himself of the
sanctioned leave. 927 Europeans and 765 Indian  sepoys were involved
in the Siege of Lucknow. Lawrence worked day and night and exacted
work from the besieged men also. He sat on in his barracks,
indifferent to cannon fire. On July 2, 1857, he was struck by a
splinter from a cannon shot. The doctors told him that the wound was
fatal and that he would not live more than forty-eight hours. In
spite of the unbearable pain, he kept on giving orders. He breathed
his last on July 4, praying: âOh God! keep my heart pure. Thou
alone art great. This world of Thine will certainly be pure some day.
I am but a child, but it is through Thy strength that I can become
strong. Always teach me meekness, justice, good-will andpeace. I seek
not the thoughts of men. Thou art my Judge; do Thou teach me Thy
thoughts, for I fear Thee.â He loved Indians greatly. He condemned
the atrocities that were perpetrated at the time of the Mutiny and
believed that every Englishman was a trustee for India. As trustees,
the English were not to loot India, but to make the people
prosperous, to teach them self-government and to make over the
country to the Indian people in a prosperous state. The English
people have progressed because men like Lawrence are born amongst
them.</p>

Mr. Dada Osman<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>,
who has been in Natal for the last 15 years or more, is a landed
proprietor who settled in Vryheid as a general merchant during the
time of the Republican Government. He was allowed to trade in Vryheid
unfettered up to the  outbreak  of hostilities, and now, after a
single-handed struggle against the British power for over three
years, finds himself face to face with ruin. And Dada Osman is a
British subject! If a foreigner were to ask why a British subject
should have British machinery put into operation against him in order
to deprive him of his civic rights, he not being a criminal, the
answer would beâsuch is the British Constitution. If it is very
often strong to protect, it is also often powerless to defend against
a palpable injustice. It is unbelievable that a man who has been
lawfully trading for a long time should be deprived of the right of
continuing his trade at the bidding of half-a-dozen of his
competitors, who, being too cowardly to meet him in open competition,
take advantage of temporary power placed in their hands to traduce

the big traders have not hesitated to mercilessly use the power thus
given them. The Act was passed to crush the Indian. When he is dead
or gone, it will be used against the small white traders. Then will
be a fight for the gods to see. The poor, humble Indian fights
constitutionally. For a fight of that description, the Local Boards,

In Mr. Dada Osmanâs case, there is not a shred of justification for
the action of the Vryheid Board. He was the only Indian merchant in
that township. His was not an application for a new licence. His
business premises were kept in an exceptionally satisfactory
condition. But because he wears a brown skin, the white members of
the Board have closed his store without compensation, and, moreover,
have rejected his solicitorsâ application for permission to keep
his store open whilst he is trying to secure relief from a higher
power. This is not a case of the Vryheid Local Board vs. Dada Osman.
It is a case of white British subjects and white foreigners against
the British Indian community. It is in that light that every Indian
merchant has to look at the case; and it is in the same light that
Mr. Lyttelton will have to examine it.</p>

The Government of South Australia has noticed that smoking, besides
consuming a lot of money, badly undermines the health of the people.
More harm is done by cigarettes than by cigars, for  the  former,
being smaller and cheaper, are consumed in excess. The Government
therefore propose to introduce a Bill prohibiting the manufacture and
sale of cigarettes.</p>

The evil habit of smoking cigarettes has nowadays become very
widespread among us, both young and old. This is sheer imitation of
the English. Formerly, people were no doubt in the habit of smoking
<i>bidis </i>or country cigarettes, but they used to keep it within
limits. They felt ashamed of smoking any and everywhere. They did it
at specific times and that, too, in privacy. It was considered lack
of decency to smoke publicly in the streets at all hours of the day,
and people rarely smoked outside their homes. Hence the saying about
tobacco, that it spoils âa corner [in the house] of one who chews
it, the whole house of one who smokes it, and the clothes of one who
sniffs itâ. But the English today never mind smoking anywhere and
everywhere, and we</p>

too are copying them. When the people in a country like South
Australia have begun to realise the harm done by smoking, we also, we
hope, will learn a lesson and come to some decision in the matter.</p>

Sir T. Madhav Rao was born in 1828 in the city of Kumba- konam<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>.
His father, Shri R. Langa Rao, had been the Dewan of Travancore, and
his uncle, Rai R. Venkat Rao, had been the Dewan as well as Revenue
Commissioner of Travancore. Sir Madhav Rao had spent his childhood
and received his education in Madras. He studied at Presidency
College [Madras] under Mr. Powell. Madhav Rao was a hard-working
student, and was proficient in Mathematics and Science. He had learnt
astronomy while sitting on the stairs of Mr. Powellâs house, and he
made a microscope and a telescope from bamboo with his own hands.</p>

Unwilling to part with such an intelligent student, Mr. Powell
appointed him Professor of Mathematics and Physics under himself.
Later, Madhav Rao got a good post in the office of the
Accountant-General, and after some time, on being invited to work as 
a tutor to the princes of Travancore, he accepted the offer. This was
how he entered,for the first time, the service of a Native State.
Theprinces in his charge became good students, and their career as
rulers also proved to be very successful. After working as a tutor
for four years, he was given the responsible post of an assistant to
the Dewan. He was later appointed Deputy Dewan, in which  post  he
earned a good name. The State had been in a very bad condition. The
late Mr. J. Bruce Norton has said of him: âHe was a great scholar
and a political administrator. In the short space of a year he
established peace in the land. To everyone he meted out justice
without fear or favour. He greatly reduced theft, treachery and
deceit.â</p>

The Dewan of Travancore was a very weak man, and the Maharaja too was
ill-informed. He did not know how the administration was going on,
and the officers of the State too had become debased and corrupt.
Their salary, moreover, was very low and sometimes fell into arrears
for months. The loan advanced by the British Government had not yet
been repaid, and the treasury was</p>

empty. The taxes being heavy, trade was in a very bad state and the
people were reduced to utter poverty. This caught the attention of
Lord Dalhousie<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>who
resolved to take over the administration of the State on behalf of
the British Government and proceeded to Octacamund with a view to
annexing the State to Madras Presidency. At this time, the Maharaja
appointed Madhav Rao to the  post  of Dewan and he successfully
pleaded with the British Government to give him seven yearsâ time
to improve the State administration. In this way, at: the early age
of 30, by dint of personal effort and honesty, Madhav Rao attained a
distinguished position. The notable event of his career as Dewan
pertained to the State revenues. The State finances were in a bad way
when he took charge as Dewan. He abolished the excessive land revenue
and other taxes imposed in the past as they were harmful to the
prosperity of the people. He also abolished the system of monopoly
for revenue collection. He met the deficit in the annual revenues by
levying an export duty of 15 per cent. on all goods. As the State
went on prospering, he gradually reduced the rate of this duty and
brought it down to 5 per cent. Next he abolished the monopoly in
tobacco also and permitted State subjects to buy it directly from
outside, replacing the former system of Government first buying it at
its own risk from the contractors and then selling it to the people.
The tariff burden being thus made light, imports received much
encouragement. He then removed many other petty taxes and cesses as
they did not yield much revenue and were also harmful to the
prosperity of the merchants. He reduced, at one stroke, the very
heavy land tax in a certain village. In 1865, on behalf of
Travancore, he entered into a trade agreement with the British
Government and the Government of Cochin, as a result of which the
customs duty  on goods imported from British Indian and Cochin
territories was abolished for the most part.</p>

In appreciation of his able administration the British Government
conferred upon him the title of K.C.S.I. When this title was
ceremoniously conferred upon him before a large gathering in Madras,
Lord Napier spoke highly of him. In 1872, Madhav Rao resigned his
post. During his tenure he established an orderly government in place
of misrule, and thereby ensured security of life and property for the
subjects. He constructed huge and massive buildings, thus giving
encouragement to the artisans. He had many works of public utility
executed and promoted  agriculture by reducing land revenue. But for

A little later Maharaja Tukojirao Holkar of Indore<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

Maharaja accepted them for a period of two years. The most noteworthy
work he did there was the formulation of the Indore Penal Code.
During the two years he held office, he did many good things for the

About this time Malhar Rao Gaekwar of Baroda had been deposed for
maladministration of the State, and the offer was made to Madhav Rao
of the post of Administrator of the State, which he accepted. Baroda
was then in a very perilous condition. Treachery, murder and rioting
were rampant everywhere. There was discord among the people, life and
property were unsafe, and a strong man was needed to restore peace
and order. The monopoly of collecting State revenues was vested in
big <i>Sardars</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
Money-lenders tyrannized over the people with the aid of the police.
The State was brimming over with intrigue and conspiracy, and there
was no end  of lawlessness. But Sir Madhav Rao was not discouraged.
He conducted the administration ably. Troublesome intriguers were
banished from the State. The <i>Sardars </i>and the <i>Sahukars</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3
</font></sup>were deprived of their monopolies, and the State revenue
was placed on a sound footing. The land revenue sepoys were withdrawn
and assigned civil duties. The courts of law were reorganised to
ensure justice. Libraries were  opened. Efficient men were called in
from Bombay and Madras and the standards of the services raised. The
narrow lanes in Baroda were demolished and burnt down so that
beautiful buildings could take their place. Gardens were laid out and
a museum was constructed. In this way, he went on for years without
any respite, introducing one reform after another. In 1882 the
British Government conferred upon him the title of Raja. In
appreciation of his services the Maharaja Gaekwar gave him a gift of
three lakhs of rupees. From then  on  he lived in retirement as a
private citizen.Even during his retirement he did public work
whenever the occasion demanded. He devoted a great deal of attention
to education and pleaded for womenâs education. He</p>

	The long-promised report of the bubonic plague that broke out in
	Johannesburg last year is now published. It is a bulky volume
	covering one hundred and three pages, and containing many charts
	giving a graphic report of the epidemic. Dr. Pakes, the author of
	the report has given an immense amount of labour to the work, and
	has presented to the public a very learned disquisition. The most
	interesting part of the report must necessarily be the origin of the
	plague, and while, if the premises laid down by Dr. Pakes were
	correct, the conclusions drawn by him would be justified we fear
	that many of his most important premises are totally incorrect.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
	It is, perhaps, extremely unfortunate that a proper  judicial
	inquiry was not made as to the origin of the plague before so much
	valuable time and money were spent over the report. In giving the
	startling reason that Dr. Pakes has done, he has run counter to the
	findings of the Vienna Commission, as also the Commission that was
	appointed by the Natal Government when the plague first broke out in
	Natal as also, indeed, to the cablegram that was received by the
	late Mr. Escombe from the Indian Government. Dr. Pakes contends that
	âthe origin of the first cases was the plague-infected rice
	imported from Bombayâ. The authorities we have just quoted came to
	the conclusion that rice was not a carrier of plague infection.
	Amongst the premises that have led Dr. Pakes to his conclusion are
	that the first cases were those of store-keepers, that the Indian
	store-keepers were importing rice from Bombay in December 1903, that
	they said very definitely âthis rice contained rat-droppingsâ,
	and that no special precautions were taken at Bombay to prevent the
	export of probably and possibly infected rice.</p>

	Now, unfortunately for Dr.  Pakesâ  theory,  all  these  premises
	are without foundation. The very first mistake that has been
	committed in drawing up the report is to accept only the official
	date  of the outbreak, and to ignore the whole of the previously
	known history. It was then contended, indeed proved beyond doubt,
	that</p>

plague had existed in Johannesburg before the 18th March. In spite of
the correspondence <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>that
was brought to the notice of the plague authorities in their official
capacity, Dr. Pakes has seen fit to ignore  the whole of it in his
report. He  has also ignored  the case  of  the  late Dr. Marais,
which points unmistakably to the existence of the plague long before
he himself succumbed to it. The theory, therefore, that the plague
started with store-keepers falls to the ground. Nay, more, the two
names given by Dr. Pakes as those of store-keepers were not those of
store-keepers at all, as we happen to know. The first cases, taking
the outbreak as from the 18th March, were amongst the labourers who
came from the mines.</p>

We should very much like to know where the information, that rice was
being imported from Bombay, comes from. As a rule, rice is not
imported from Bombay but from Calcutta, and, even when it does come
from Bombay, the bags are made up in Calcutta. It is a serious
reflection upon the Indian Government to state that no special
precautions are taken at Bombay to prevent the export of probably and
possibly infected rice. Those who know anything of Indian travelling
know that precautions taken at Bombay are very severe. Therefore, all
the material premises leading to the conclusion that Dr. Pakes has
arrived at are not, in our opinion, capable of being proved. How is
it, again, that Johannesburg had remained free from the plague in
spite of rice having been imported by Indians before also ? For it is
not to be contended that rice was for the first time introduced into
Johannesburg in 1904. What the real cause of the epidemic was will
probably never be known, but so long as it is not found, so long will
measures to prevent an outbreak fail. We do not suggest that there
will be a recurrence in Johannesburg, for the plague epidemic, in  an
altitude so high as that of Johannesburg, is hardly possible, except
under the most aggravating circumstances. In spite of his usual 
fairness, we fear that Dr. Pakes has failed to do justice in entirely
ignoring the Herculean efforts that were made by the Indian community
to prevent an outbreak of plague by placing at  the disposal of the
authorities all the information of suspected cases, as also warning
them of the state of the Location after it passed into the hands of
the Municipality. We feel that Dr. Pakes has shirked the real issue
by giving extracts from the evidence of Dr. Porter before the
Insanitary Area Commission in his work as to the then state of the
Indian Location. The measures that were taken to eradicate the</p>

We are quite at a loss to perceive how the importation of a few
necessary clerks can be âmaking the Transvaal a dumping ground for
thousands of Indian subjectsâ, but it is perhaps too much to expect
the <i>Budget </i>to view the Asiatic question with even a modicum of
common sense. The justice of our remarks is, surely, self-evident.
The entire shutting out of new Indians would mean the ultimate
driving out of most Indians from that Colony; and, however desirable
such a consummation may be to a section of the Transvaal population,
we can scarcely be expected to view the matter in quite the same
light. We make bold to say that there is absolutely nothing in our
remarks to justify the inference above mentioned. We have never
advocated that the Transvaal should be made a dumping ground for
Indians. But we do maintain that, if elementary justice is to be
done, Indians already residing in the Transvaal ought to be allowed
to draw upon India for a</p>

necessary supply of clerks and such assistants, whether they are old
residents of the Transvaal or not. These men can only number a very
few per year. Our contemporary may not know that such facility is
given even in the self-governing Colonies of the Cape and  Natal,
where also there are restriction laws. We have no hesitation in
saying that to deny the right of Indian merchants to depend upon
India for necessary skilled assistance is undoubtedly to contemplate
slow starvation of the already resident Indian population. The
position we have laid down is by no means novel. We refer the <i>Budget
</i>to Lord Milnerâs despatch wherein he has most clearly laid down
that Indians of education, means and ability should not be  prevented
 from entering the Transvaal, whether they be new immigrants or not.</p>

mind they should vividly show the secret of Britainâs success. Max
MÃ¼ller has acknowledged in his writings that  in Indianphilosophy
the meaning of life is summed up in four letters speltâ<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">DUTY</font>.
Probably at the present day such a meaning of life is not apparent in
the conduct of the average Indian. A contemplation of Lord Nelsonâs
life, then, presents in a most striking manner an illustration of
duty lived from first to last.</p>

The historic signal âEngland expects that every man will do his
dutyâ is enshrined in the British heart. The signal was sanctified
by the unflinching performance of its author, and has been hallowed
by a century of its translation into deeds. The measure of Englandâs
success is the measure of her peopleâs acceptance of Nelsonâs
signal in the conduct of their own lives. If the sun never sets on
the Empire, of which Nelson was one of the founders, it is because
her sons have hitherto followed the path of duty.</p>

Nelson is worshipped today as no other man is worshipped in the
Empire, not because he was a naval hero, not because he was a man who
never received an answer to his question as to what fear was,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

was firstâhe himself was last. He fought because that was his duty.
No wonder that his men followed where he led them. He it was who made
England Mistress of the Seas. But he was much more. There was no
self-interest in his service. His patriotism was of the purest type.</p>

In a continent like South Africa, where there are constant
deflections from the straight path shown by Nelson, it is  well  to
remind ourselves of a life like his. It ought to sober down
prejudices. It ought to set us all thinking more of our
responsibility than of our rights. To the Indian especially, if the
somewhat disagreeable life in South Africa embitters him against the
Englishman who judges him harshly, the events of the past week should
reassure him that they are still countrymen of Nelsonâs, and that
they cannot quite forsake the path of duty so long as they cherish
Horatio Nelsonâs  memory. Herein there is reason for hope and an
incentive to love Britain in spite of the faults of Britishers.</p>

Last week we related the sad story of the hardships and indignities

</font></sup>It is necessary to consider from time to time how to
protect ourselves against such a downpour. The whites have fully
girded up their loins. No wonder if the tyranny let loose in Vryheid
today is repeated in another village tomorrow. No Indian trader can
for a moment confidently say that his licence will be renewed from
year to year. We have shown elsewhere how influential white men like
Dr. Campbell<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>have
been doggedly pursuing us with cudgels in their hands. If we sit back
at such a time, we shallbe washed away by the flood. To wake up when
it is too late would be like digging a well after the house has
caught fire. The Indian traders, whether big or small, should
immediately make it public whenever they encounter any difficulty in
obtaining their licences. It is the duty of the Congress to appoint a
special Licences Committee to investigate cases in which traders are
deprived of their licences. It should be the duty of such a Committee
to go from village to village and record such cases. We believe that
this journal reaches and is read in every village. We can cope with
the work properly only if the following details are sent to us

It has come to our knowledge  that some Indians are offended  by our
article on the plague. We are sorry, but not surprised. We should
rather be complimented on drawing attention to the subject, but we
are being blamed because we do not hesitate  to  mention othersâ
faults. Thanks to the plague, many villages in India have been laid
waste, numerous families entirely wiped out, and people are running
in fright from one place to another. Wherever there has been plague
outside India, our people have largely been responsible for importing
it, and its quick eradication from those parts has been due to the
fact that the task of combating it is generally in the hands of other
people. What is the duty of the Press, that is, our duty, on such an
occasion ? We could easily win the applause of the people by
suppressing their faults. But we would fail utterly in our duty if we
did so. Our duty is to serve the people. While championing their
rights, if we happen to observe any of their shortcomings, we must
bring these to their notice. If instead of doing so we went on
flattering them, we would be playing the part of an enemy. As we said
at the very outset, we shall boldly defend our people if our
opponents speak ill of them; but at the same time, if we notice any
shortcomings in our people, we shall fearlessly expose them to the
public gaze and urge their removal. Who will do this if we donât ?
We have never cherished, nor do we do so now, the idea of doing
anything simply to please others. It is our duty to administer the
bitter pill. It is quite obvious that, when plague breaks out amongst
us, it clearly leads to loss of life; more than that, it means a blow
to the whole community. We must not forget how the entire community
was affected when plague broke out in Durban,</p>

</font></sup>The easiest way to deal with plague is to notify a case
as soon as it occurs. When plague broke out in Bombay for the first
time in 1896, neither the people nor the doctors did anything to
suppress it. If the necessary steps had been taken in time, it is
possible that hundreds of thousands of lives that were lost might
have been saved. Plague can be rooted out even now if people are
properly educated in this matter. There are certain reasons why this
has not been possible in India. The people there are poor and
ignorant, but here they are not. The people who travel five thousand
miles, live amidst unfriendly folk and earn their bread cannot by any
means be considered ignorant. If, living in this country, we do not
learn how to deal with this contagious disease, we have only our
obstinacy to thank. It is, we believe, the supreme duty of those who
are in a position to offer guidance in such matters to enlighten
people and lead them along the right path. We say this without the
least fear; for whatever we have written so far will have been in
vain if we try to flatter our readers out of fear. We have been
repeatedly telling people to stick to their resolve, to remain
courteous under all circumstances, and to discharge their duties
courageously. We are publishing the biographical sketches of brave
men and women like Sir Henry Lawrence and Elizabeth Fry and exhorting
our readers to follow the examples of those heroic souls. In the end,
we appeal to  all  our readers to take our writings in the spirit in
which they are written. It is possible that we might unwittingly
commit mistakes in the course of our public service. We shall be
grateful if those who notice any such draw our attention to them.</p>

<i>The </i><i>Daily </i><i>Mail, </i>a well-known English paper, has 
narrated  a story of great loyalty shown by an Indian in India. He
was a surveyor named Khan Bahadur Mohiuddin. It fell to his lot in
1903 to survey arid waste land in Rajputana. He had with him four
messengers, four assistant surveyors and two camels. Once, travelling
at night,  they found their water-bag burst and all the water
drained. The messengers advised return, but brave Mohiuddin was not
the man to turn back. He sent one of the messengers in search of
water, which was fetched but was found to be exceedingly brackish.
Marching on they came upon some water which, however, soon gave out.
The Khan Bahadur had by then become absorbed in deep thought. The
camel-drivers were tied to the camels, and the animals allowed to go
as they pleased, for meanwhile the men had fainted, owing to thirst.
At last they came to a watering-place and regained consciousness.
When in search of water thus, Mohiuddin strayed from his men, and
ultimately, lost his life while doing his duty. However, infected
with his enthusiasm, the men bravely completed the task. We rarely
come across examples of such bravery and devotion to duty. The Khan
Bahadurâs body was given an honourable burial and his companions,
who survived him, were handsomely rewarded by the Government.</p>

Nelson did while yet so young; rare was the daring he showed and the
tasks he performed. Togo<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>is

being very recent, their consequences are not yet apparent. Our minds

âWhat is fear ?â Nelson asked the question of his grandmother
when he was hardly twelve. The grandmother could give no reply, and
all his life he knew no fear. At twelve he began going out to sea and
doing brave deeds such as few men could do.</p>

In 1789 the Revolution broke out in France. Napoleon Bonaparte came
to the fore. He was determined to conquer  all  Europe. And he would
have done it too, it is said, but for Nelson. In fact England alone
remained unconquered. Napoleon told his Captains: âHold the English
Channel clear for me only for six hours, and I will conquer England.â
But Nelson foiled his hopes. A fierce battle ensued between the
French and the English navies. In the three great engagements that
took place, Nelson successively lost an arm, an eye and, finally, his
life.</p>

</font></sup>If England sustained a defeat this time, she would lose
prestige. Nelson was well aware of this and had made the necessary
preparations. The officers and men under him all but worshipped him.
There was not a danger that he had not himself braved. When in the
Battle of the Nile<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3 </font></sup>he
lost an arm, Nelson busied himself with caring for the wounded
utterly regardless of his own pain. So daring was he. He was
determined not to own defeat as long as a single British sailor was
alive. His army was inspired by the same spirit. In his flagship, <i>The
Invincible, </i>he roared like a lion. The crucial battle was fought
on October 19. Nelson unfurled his flag and sent round the word:
âEngland expects every man will do his duty.â A French ship and
Nelsonâs ship fell upon each other; there was a torrent of cannon
fire; Nelson was wounded. He had himself carried to his cabin. He
covered his badges, etc., with his hands so that no one should know
that it was Nelson who had been wounded. The battle continued. In

The Chinese began taking tea in the ninth century and have done so
ever since. Tea was first introduced into England in 1660. By the
eighteenth century it had spread all over the country, and at the
turn of that century, twenty million pounds of tea were imported into
England every year. In the first decade of the nineteenth century,
the <i>per-capita </i>[annual consumption of tea in England was a
pound and a half, but during the last decade, the consumption has
increased so</p>

The first to raise his voice against tea was the famous John Wesley.
He was a very great religious preacher. He was subject to fits of
giddiness; but he did not suspect that it was due to tea, because
everyone thought it wholly beneficial. Once, all of a sudden, he
swooned and fell down and then resolved to give up tea; his giddiness
ceased. Sir Andrew Clarke, a famous doctor, has said that tea weakens
the nerves. Thousands of women in England, it is reported, have been
suffering for years; they have headaches, they have cramps in their
legs and suffer from giddinessâall this is mainly ascribed to the
tea habit. The officer in charge of the Southwark inquiry says that
tea becomes all the more injurious if it is boiled. It is best of
course to do without it; but if the habit cannot be given up, the
best way of making tea is to pour boiling water over the tea leaves,
and immediately pour it out into a cup. The brew should not at all be
red, it should rather be the colour of hay.</p>

Among us the custom of taking tea is of recent origin. In India,
there is no need for it, but if, in imitation of the whites, people
do want to have some drink, they should instead drink coffee or cocoa

Sir Thomas Munro was born at Glasgow in the month of May, 1761. In
1780, he took service under the East India Company at Madras. At that
time, the condition of the British in India was very precarious.
Hyder Ali was preparing to oust them. The English employees of the
Company were quarrelling among themselves. At this juncture, Munro
rendered valuable service.</p>

After he had been engaged for five years in military campaigns, he
took up a civil post. He was appointed in the Revenue Department in
Berhampur Taluk. Like Sir Henry Lawrence, he also took full advantage
of this opportunity, and lived among the people. He was available to
them at all times. He used to go out for walks with them, and
listened to the long tales of the poor peasants, their joys and
sorrows. He used to talk with the people unaccompanied by any clerk
or peon, and lived a very simple life. In one of his letters, he
says: âToday I made my porridge from wheat flour instead of oat
meal, and tomorrow also, I do not think I shall take anything besides</p>

8plantains. I am at present continuously touring village after
village, fixing the land revenue to be collected from the ryots. I
cannot think of doing anything else. I do not get even an hourâs 
respite  for personal work. Even as I am writing this, there are a
dozen persons sitting beside me. They started coming in at seven in
the morning. It is now twelve.â In this way, Munro worked for seven
years in the districts, pleased the people and at the same time put
Government revenue on a sound basis. It was now that he was entrusted
with an even more responsible job. He was placed in charge of the
Kanara Taluk. Though the climate of the place was very bad, he worked
without any respite for 26 months out of a sense of duty. Every day
he spent as many as ten hours listening to the peopleâs grievances.
He says how, living in a small tent, in the midst of the people, he
could win their hearts more easily than by living in a fine bungalow
by the seaside, and how they were becoming loyal subjects. His bed
consisted of a bamboo cot, a mattress and a pillow. As soon as he got
up in the morning, he came out and was occupied in talking to the
groups of people that were always there waiting for him. After
breakfast, he issued instructions to the men under him and attended
to the correspondence. Then he went to the office. He had tiffin at
five in the afternoon, and again he resumed work at eight oâclock,
the discussions, at times, going on till midnight. After he had
dispensed peace and happiness to the people in the Kanara Taluk, he
was given a more important post in the Nizamâs territory. The
people there had been reduced to utter poverty by famines in previous
 years. Brigandage and robbery were rampant, and bad characters had 
become all powerful. By his courage and determination Munro raised
the state to prosperity.</p>

Having served thus for twenty-seven years, Munro went home on leave.
In England he got married. He returned to India  as  Chairman of the
Commission appointed to inquire into the working of the Judicial
Department of Madras Presidency. He gave effective expression to his
sympathy for the Indians, and recommended that they should be
appointed to higher posts in the Judicial Department. The work of the
Commission was interrupted by the Maratha War of 1817, in which he
became absorbed. Though the army under him was untrained and
inadequate, it was wholly loyal to him, thanks to his popularity with
the people. Munro became so engrossed in the War, and underwent so
much physical strain that his health broke down, and on the
termination of the war in 1819, he went back to England. In 1820 he
was knighted and again came out to India as Governor of 8Madras. He
held this post till the very end of his life. Even when he</p>

was Governor, he worked as hard and lived as simply as before. He
went out for walks alone and saw any one who sought an interview.
Whenever there was an opportunity, he appointed or  promoted  Indians
to responsible posts. This kind-hearted Governor died of cholera in
1827. He was never motivated by self interest. He was always keen on
finding out what his duty was and how he could discharge it. He had
boundless love for Indians. He fully deserved the title âFriend of
the Ryotâ. There have been such simple and kind-hearted Englishmen
in the past, and some are to be found even now. That is why, despite
many blemishes, the star of British rule keeps on shining bright.</p>

The Prisons Reform Commission gives rise to many misgivings as to the
condition of indentured Indians on some of the estates in Natal. At
Verulam recently, according to a Reuter telegram published in the
<i>Transvaal Leader, </i>evidence was given by gaol officials to the
effect that it is customary with certain estates  employing  large
numbers of Indians to get their coolies, when ill, convicted of some
minor offence in order that they may be cured of their sickness at
the expense of the Government and returned fit for work. Had such a
charge been made by an outsider, he would undoubtedly have been
hooted out of court, so inhuman and unbelievable does it appear at
first sight. We ourselves are loth to credit it but those who have 
given the testimony must have spoken with a full sense of
responsibility, and we may assume that they have rather understated
than overstated facts. The matter is too serious to be left where it
is. And it is a serious thing also that the public of Natal should
get the first news of so grave an allegation from outside its
borders. We believe the Natal Press has been wholly silent on this
matter, though <i>The Natal Mercury </i>noticed in aneditorial note
the shocking state of the Verulam gaol. We must be content to wait
the usual length of time for the publication of the Report before we
can know exactly what the evidence was.</p>

We have said we cannot bring ourselves to believe  that  the charge
can be generally sustained, but while thinking it somewhat
improbable, we cannot forget the hideous things that were brought to
light by a Commission on the treatment of indentured Indians in
British Guiana about forty years ago. Then, things far more inhuman</p>

and unbelievable were proved to have occurred, and not in isolated
instances. The treatment of sick Indians especially was peculiarly
bad, and that in spite of excellent laws for their protection. This
can be to some extent understood when it is remembered that a sick
indentured Indian is a dead weight on his employer. It is to be hoped
that the estate-owners will themselves insist on a thorough
investigation for the sake of their fair name. It is not right that
the misdeeds of one or twoâif the charge be provenâ should
reflect on others whose aim it is to treat their indentured and
helpless employees not  only  with justice but with something more.</p>

The title of this article is a maxim as old as the hills, and the
policy underlying the maxim was enunciated by a British statesman in
connection with British rule in India. The cablegram from India that
has appeared lately in the newspapers brings the aphorism vividly
home to us. It is said that twenty thousand Mahomedans at Dacca, the
capital of the new province partitioned from Bengal, assembled
together and offered prayers of thanksgiving to the Almighty for the
partition, and their consequent deliverance from Hindu oppression. We
cannot bring ourselves to believe that the  movement  could possibly
be spontaneous. It is absurd on the face of it. Assuming that there
was any oppression on the part of the Hindus, relief could be
obtained without partition, because the might of the British power
was there to protect one community against another. It is, therefore,
we consider, a response to the very powerful agitation that has been
set up in Bengal against partition. The boycott has spread with an
intensity never known before. It has permeated classes as well as
masses, and, if it is nursed long enough, it bids fair to weld
together all the communities in Bengal, not excluding the Mahomedans.
Those, therefore, who believe in the maxim above quoted, naturally
wanted an antidote and they have found it amongst a few Mahomedans in
Dacca. It is short-sighted statesmanship to contemplate the
government of millions of human beings on the principle of setting
one class against another. We know that such a suggestion would be
vehemently repudiated, and we know also that pure British
statesmanship would revolt against the idea. At the  same  time,
thepolicy itself is deep rooted, has been followed before with</p>

temporary effect, and the <i>tamasha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">
</font></sup>in Dacca is but a continuation of it. If the
Anglo-Indian administrators, who have really built up the Indian
Empire, and who depended for its continuance on the goodwill of the
people, were to rise from their graves today, they,  in  our opinion,
would be the first to encourage the boycott agitation, at the same
time, conciliating public opinion, which has become so excited. What
can be more natural than for the people to wish to clothe themselves,
to feed themselves, and to supply their luxuries out of home-grown
products and home manufactures ? We see such movements worked out
more extensively in many Colonies. It is a legitimate and healthy
growth amongst the people, not in the slightest degree inconsistent
with a feeling of loyalty to the British Crown. It is only a
fulfilment of the prophecy uttered by Macaulay in connection with
India.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.26cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
But, if the rulers of India will not see the reasonableness of the
movement, why should not the Indians ? It is true that, to a certain
extent, the introduction of British rule was possible by reason of
internal dissensions but it is the peculiar province, as also the
privilege, of Great Britain to bring together the two great
communities in India, and to leave to them an heritage for which she
would receive not only the gratitude of the millions in India, but
the unstinted admiration of the whole world. It behoves, then, both
communities to seize the opportunity offered to them, and to sink
material<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>jealousies
and dissensions for their common good. Better far, that two  brothers
should suffer at the hands of each other, than that a third party
should step into the breach and gain an advantage over them. We would
ask those who see these lines, no matter who they be, to join with us
in the prayer that the present agitation in Bengal, which has in it
the germs of the unification of the different communities, may grow
in strength, and that the people of Dacca or elsewhere, whether
Hindus or Mahomedans, may have the good sense to refrain from  doing
anything that may mar the glorious possibilities that are opened up
to the people of India.</p>

Our contemporary then goes on to say that this is not a question of
white and brown. Our remarks have been called an error. Unfortunately
for our contemporary, we have to use the same expression for its
remarks quoted above. The question whether Mr. Dada Osman was
entitled to a licence or to trade is beside the issue, and a
distinction has been drawn without any difference. The fact is that
the decision of the Board ruins Mr. Dada Osman, and this was the
burden of our remarks. That the applicant had no âvested rightâ
in the legal sense of the term shows the strength of our contention
that the British constitution, at times, is so full of weaknesses
that it enthrones injustice and strengthens it, as in this case. To
an ordinary man, the deprivation of a manâs right to trade without
any compensation, after he has been so engaged for several years, is
very much akin to robbery, which is miscalled law when it is done
under cover of a statute. We join issue with our contemporary when it
says that it is only a question of whether Dada Osman should go into
a Location. We venture to inform our contemporary that Law  3  of
1885, dealing with Locations, has been interpreted by the Supreme
Court of the Transvaal to mean that it does not require British
Indians to trade in Locations. In the Transvaal, an Indian has the
right to trade anywhere he chooses, and he can demand a licence
against tender of money. Vryheid has taken over the Transvaal laws 
including  the Indian laws, and it has to abide by them. Had it not
been, therefore, for the Dealersâ Licences Act of Natal, Mr. Dada
Osman would today be trading in the town of Vryheid. It is the
Licences Act which has been put into operation against him, and which
has enabled the rival traders thus to set aside all ideas of justice
and to ruin a poor man because, we repeat, âhe wears a brown skinâ.

âThe right to rule belongs to the ruler only if he works for the
happiness of the ruled.â Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, who uttered
these words and acted up to them, was born in Calcutta on January 30,
1785. After receiving an indifferent sort of education in England he
gave up his studies at the early age of fifteen and [came to]
Calcutta the following year. In those days the East India Company was
very strict in selecting its employees, and inexperienced youths
without proper education were not admitted to its service. Metcalfe
was therefore obliged to enter the college at Calcutta. Thus, after
receiving education for some time, Metcalfe was appointed to a
subordinate post. At nineteen, he became Head Clerk to General Lake.
General Lake and the officers under him were annoyed to find the
young man in the civil department. Metcalfe took the hint and made up
his mind to prove his valour in war. He took the lead in storming the
fort of Dig<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>and
put in such excellent work that General Lake became greatly pleased
with him. Three years later Metcalfe was assigned a very responsible
piece of work. The French were conspiring with Maharaja Ranjit Singh
in the Punjab. Metcalfe was entrusted with the task of thwarting
their designs and it was through his efforts that a treaty was signed
between the British Government and Ranjit Singh. Lord Minto was so
pleased with Metcalfeâs achievement that he appointed him Resident
in Delhi when he was only twenty-six.</p>
