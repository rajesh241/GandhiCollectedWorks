Now all of you should maintain silence. Do not talk. We have to
finish our programme, if possible by 5 o’clock. In this I seek the
help of all the delegates. Concerning the first resolution that will
be moved today, no discussion is necessary and so no lengthy
explanation is called for. Therefore I shall simply read it out. I
also want to say that no copies have been distributed amongst you of
the resolutions that will be moved today. The Reception Committee was
not able to do this; there is no press in Belgaum so that all the
resolutions that the Reception Committee wanted to print could be
printed. The Subjects Committee can continue its sittings for two or
three days and the resolutions that it drafts can be printed. But
there is no resolution which makes it necessary to distribute its
copies amongst you. You will forgive me as well as the Reception
Committee for this, and pass the resolutions as they are read out to
you.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

A friend refers to the Board mentioned in the resolution and wants to
know the names of the personnel. There are two things mentioned. If
the Board appointed by the Unity Conference does not do its work, it
can be replaced by another Board. I forget all the names that
comprise the Board of the Unity Committee; you will see them in the
newspapers. I am there, Shaukat Ali is there and some other Muslim
brethren. I do not want to leave it either. I think the Board that
has been appointed will collect testimony in regard to the happenings
at Kohat. Only when it arrives in Rawalpindi can it be known as to
what it is possible to do and what it is not. Whatever can be done
will of course be done. Those of you who support the resolution may
duly raise their hands.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

Before doing so, let me inform you that some Tamil friends have
written to me asking that the resolutions might also be translated
into Tamil. I am extremely sorry that I cannot possibly do that.
There are 21 provinces to deal with and if we are to render each
resolution into so many languages, it would really be not possible to
get on. Up to now we have been adopting three languages: One is Hindi
which everyone is expected to know ; the second is English; and the
third is the vernacular of the province. We have not been able to
reach that common medium, Hindustani, through which we can know each
other, because we have always the South to obstruct the way. That is
why we are using the vernacular of this province as well as English.
But I would suggest for such cases that those who know English or
Hindustani in the said province should take the trouble of explaining
the resolutions passed here to their friends who do not know any of
the languages here spoken. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

Before I put this resolution to vote I must answer note that I have
received. A friend asks if the resolution on removal of untoucha-
bility implies inter-dining and inter-marriage with the untouchables.
There is nothing in the resolution suggesting this, but if this
friend wants to know what I myself feel in the matter I will say that
I have expressed my views in <i>Navajivan </i>and <i>Young India

untouchable as we behave with other castes.</p>

Before I move the next resolution I have an atonement to make. When
the resolution on removal of untouchability was being moved, I had it
in mind to present an untouchable brother before you. I had received
a note saying an untouchable brother who was not a delegate wanted to
say a few words. I had felt that even though he was not a delegate it
would be good to permit him to speak as he was an untouchable. And so
I had wanted to call him. But I forgot. The only way I now can atone
for it is to apologize to him. Anyway, it is good that I remembered
in time.</p>

You have heard the statement that Dr. Besant has made. You will not
expect me to make any remarks upon that statement. Dr. Besant has not
made the statement, as I know, in order that she may have reply just
now. She has made that statement from a sense of duty so that her
silence might not be construed into meaning that we had her assent to
the resolution that we passed yesterday. But I hope I may give her
the assurance of this Congress that all that she has said will
command our respectful attention and that no stone will be left
unturned by this Congress or Congressmen and Congresswomen to open
the door wide, as wide as is humanly possible, for the entrance of
every party that has the interest of India at heart and every party
whose goal is swaraj for India. With these words I close this
incident, repeating my request to Dr. Besant that whether she and
other parties are able to join the Congress or not, the Congress will
always expect her and every party’s sympathy and support in
anything and everything that may commend itself to their attention.</p>

The Congress is strongly of opinion that the hope of the future of
the country lies in its youth and therefore trusts that the
Provincial Committees will strive more vigorously than they have done
to keep alive all national educational institutions. But whilst the
Congress is of opinion that existing national educational
institutions should be maintained and new ones opened, the Congress
does not regard any such institution to be national which does not
employ some Indian language as the medium of instruction, and which
does not actively encourage Hindu-Muslim unity, education among
untouchables and removal of untouchability; which does not make
hand-spinning,</p>

Whereas it has been discovered that many otherwise deserving men are
unobtainable for national service because of the reluctance to accept
remuneration for service, the Congress places on record its opinion
that there is not only nothing derogatory to one’s dignity in
accepting remuneration for national service, but the Congress hopes
that patriotic young men and women will regard it as an honour to
accept maintenance for service faithfully rendered and that those
needing or those willing to service will prefer national to any other
service.</p>

The Congress notes with satisfaction that notwithstanding the set
back suffered by the campaign against the use of intoxicating drinks
and drugs initiated in 1921, Congress workers in several parts of the
country have continued it with vigour and determination. The Congr-

are addicted to the drink or the opium habit from the curse will 
receive further and greater strength and encouragement than hitherto.</p>

requirements.</p>

There are now only two things remaining—things that we always have
to do, namely, the election of general secretaries and a treasurer
and deciding on the venue for the next Congress. It will he desirable
to leave this to the All-India Congress Committee, as was done last
year. The treasurer is the same. The general secretaries will be:
first, Pandit Jawaharlal; second, Qureshi; and third, Mr. Bharucha.
Previ- ously Dr. Kitchlew was there and Babu Rajendra Prasad was
appro- ached. Babu Rajendra Prasad has to attend to many kinds of
activities and he cannot give all his time to our work. So the
question of two new secretaries has come up. There was a great deal
of discussion in the Subjects Committee on the matter yesterday and I
had talks with the delegates. It was decided in the end that since I
shall be the President of the Congress for this year and the next
year, secretaries should be appointed from among the people who can
help me in my work. A number of Swarajists and No-changers are there.
How would it be to take them into the Working Committee? I also liked
the idea— and I am willing to take into the Working Committee not
one but all of them, but on one condition, namely, that they
understand it clearly that there is only one national programme, that
removal of untoucha- bility, charkha, prohibition form one single
programme. I had said that if there be any Swarajist as staunchly
believing in khadi as I do I</p>

The two persons suggested are not necessarily No-changers. I know a
little bit about them which I should like to tell you. I know Shwaib
Qureshi. He is an orthodox Muslim. But I have not taken him because
of that. I want to take full-time work from secretaries. I therefore
told Maulana Shaukat Ali that if Shwaib Sahib would be willing to
give me all his time I would like to have him. He agreed. He is the
kind of man who, once he makes a promise, carries out that promise.
He has a love for khadi, this also I know.</p>

Bharucha is a crank. I am a crank too. So we shall get on splendidly.
I shall have to learn from him to carry bundles of khadi on my
shoulder and go hawking. He has become a specialist in this. It is
his wish to see khadi reach every part of the country. Not one but
hundreds of Bharuchas are required thus to sell khadi. Bharucha went
to Lala Harkishen Lal, he went to others, and gave them khadi. Even
if people swear at him, he does not mind it. The secretaries we need
today should be such that they will sell khadi even if they are
abused. They should be able to put up with any kind of insult for the
sake of khadi. I have therefore selected these two. But though I have
done my selection the final say is yours. The Subjects Committee has
of course agreed. But the constitution of the Congress requires that
you express your opinion. Those of you who accept these names should
come out with their opinion. About the treasurer nothing needs to be
said. You say if you like the man.</p>

I am sorry to see that only one Muslim brother has secured a medal.
There was a time when Muslim women spun the finest yarn. But we also
notice that out of eleven medals, four have gone to our sisters and
the rest to our brothers. A friend writes to say that he wants to
shake hands with the untouchable brother who spoke here. He is a

died on the eve of the Cocanada Congress—just a day earlier. It is
the duty of all present to mourn for him. And now we are through.</p>

excused, you did not press. And just as you expressed  your opinions
here quietly, without being noisy, in the Subjects Committee also
there was no disturbance. In fact there might have been disturbance
when the bomb of the charkha was dropped in  your midst, but you
raised no objection and in the Subjects Committee also behaved with
perfect decorum. I feel this kindness of my brethren to me must be
the result of some good deed I may have done in an earlier life. It
is my wish that the kindness you have shown towards me, you should
show towards India, for if I wish to live it is only for India and if
I wish to die, it is also only for India. Not a leaf stirs without
God’s will. But every man has a right to ask of God just as a child
asks of his father what he wants. I have seen that He even grants
what I ask Him. What God has willed cannot be otherwise.</p>

I therefore appeal to you, brothers, to gird up your loins for the
service of India and stick to the pledge you have taken. I know I
took the chair here as President and all of you gave me your love. I
desire, naturally, that everyone should praise me, but it does not
lead to any achievement. The achievement will come when all of you
act as you have pledged. I do not believe that all these tasks are
beyond our strength—the third task or the fourth or fifth— none

Listening to the speech of Bhopatkar gave me a pleasant surprise. He
demanded if we wanted the destruction of Hinduism that we treat men
as untouchables. I was very pleased. And three shastris have just
told you that there is no sanction in Hinduism for untoucha- bility
as it is practised. Is it the same thing as when we say that Hindus
and Muslims should not treat one another as enemies but as brothers?
Did you not hear what Shaukat Ali said? What did Lajpat Rai say?
Zafar Ali Khan raised an objection. I do not see anything to object
to, but he is not an enemy of India. You should treat no one as
enemy. The urge in your heart should be to make a brother of an
enemy.</p>

Lalaji has invoked a principle, namely, that the question is of the
human species as a whole. It is not confined to any particular
religion. He said if a Hindu became mad, should not a Mussalman swear
at him? If Mussalmans abused Ramachandra and Krishna should not
Hindus abuse the Prophet? If you cannot decide this matter by
forgiving, go to a court or a panchayat. I am a non-co-operator, but
if  a Mussalman abuses Lord Krishna I will say, “Go to a court, but
do not fight. There is nothing in this to fight over.” It does not
require</p>

much time to accept this principle. There should be a fever in us for
swaraj, our hearts should burn for it. When Bhopatkar was speaking I
thought of Lokamanya. He was the genius of swaraj. A remarkable thing
I heard about him is that when his wife lay dying he was busy in his
work for swaraj. If such volcanoes are created in our hearts we can
do the third thing, the fourth thing and everything else. That you
should wear khadi when you come to Congress is nothing big. That we
should give up wearing foreign-cloth is nothing big. Today I do not
talk about burning foreign-cloth. I am today not the man who in 1921
had caused foreign cloth to be burnt. But we have left peaceful ways.
If even today we can bring about complete peace I can again take up
what we did in 1921. Under the pretext of burning foreign- cloth we
heaped stones to throw at people.</p>

I know we cannot simultaneously do both: invoke truth and practise
untruth. If we invoke truth we must not practise untruth, or our
bodies will burn up. It burns my heart certainly. I cannot bear it if
someone falsely swears by God or takes false pledges. Abuse me by all
means, beat me, kick me with shoes, spit at me, I give you my word
that I shall not get angry. But take a pledge and not act on it and
anger will burn away my whole body. I should wish to die if a woman
who is unchaste should parade her chastity in front of me. I should
wish to die, again, if a man who is impure should parade his purity
in front of me. I should not wish to witness it. If you want that the
love you have shown me, the kindness you have done me in placing the
mantle of responsibility on me, should continue, you  should
understand this well; keep me in this position if you want to. But it
will be even better if the Swarajists and No-changers should  walk 
in unison, As Dr. Besant said, one single stick, by itself, easily
breaks, but in a bundle it is very strong.</p>

treachery is the reward of trust, will the man who trusts come to

I have just poured out my heart to you in my Hindi speech. It is
impossible for me to reproduce what I have said in Hindi. One thing
however I want to say. I do not think that any chairman, any
president, could possibly claim greater courtesy, greater attention
and greater affection than you the delegates have extended to me. I
assure you that it has been the greatest delight to me to preside
over your deliberations here in the Congress and in the Subjects
Committee. Every one of you have readily responded to every call that
I have made upon you. I know that I have put a heavy strain upon you.
I have not walked you. I know I have run you. But what can I do? You
are impatient and I am impatient. We want to march towards swaraj and
our march for swaraj has got to be, not at a snail’s pace, but a
double quick march; and if we do want to work and march forward, I
cannot afford to waste a single minute of your time and my time.
Therefore, I have put on speed to the best of my ability and it has
been a wonder to me—it has given to me the greatest satisfaction
that you have so readily responded to me, so nobly! And you have not
done this thing charity but with a magnificent generosity. No one
could have possibly claimed more, asked for more, and got more. You
have given me all that I could possibly ask of you.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
But what I now want to ask you for, is something more, some- thing
better, something richer, and that is this: Transfer all this noble
affection, all this generosity that you have shown to me to the thing
that you and I hold dear, to the thing that alone binds you and me
together and that is swaraj. If we want swaraj, we must know the
conditions of swaraj. You have endorsed the conditions in the resolu-
tions. Every one of you known those conditions. Do not leave these
conditions here. Take them away with you and fulfil them to the
letter and to the spirit and insist upon others to fulfil those
conditions, not by force but by love. Exert all the influence and all
the pressure which love can exert, upon everyone that surrounds you
and upon your neighbours. Go throughout your district and spread this
message of khaddar, spread this message of Hindu-Muslim unity and
spread this</p>

But you will not do it if the Swarajists and No-changers still bear
malice against each other, if they still have jealousies against one
another. It will be possible only if you bury hatred, leave all the
jealousies and anger, all those bad influences here. I ask you to
bury the hatchet. Bury the jealousies underground and cremate them
wherever you like. But take away the sacred resolution that you have
passed and say, “Let the heavens fall, but the bond that binds us
today, the tie that has bound the Swarajists and the No-changers,
shall never snap.” My work is finished.</p>

should fail to obtain <i>moksha </i>in this very birth I might be
born a <i>Bhangi </i>in my next. I believe in <i>varnashrama </i>both
according to birth and to karma. But I do not regard <i>Bhangis </i>as
in any sense a low order. On the contrary I know many <i>Bhangis </i>who
are worthy of reverence. On the other hand there are Brahmins going
about whom it would be very difficult to regard with any reverence.
Holding these views, therefore, if there is a rebirth in store for
me, I wish to be born a pariah in the midst of pariahs, because
thereby I would be able to render more effective service to them and
also be in a better position to plead with other communities on their

But just as I do not want the so-called touchables to despise the
untouchables, so also I do not want the latter to entertain any
feeling of hatred and ill-will towards the former. I do not want them
to wrest their rights by violence as is done in the West. The trend
of world opinion is against such violence. I can clearly see a time
coming in the world when it will be impossible to secure rights by
arbitrament of force, so I tell my untouchable brethren today as I
tell  the Government, that if they resort to force for the attainment
of their purpose, they shall certainly fail.</p>

I want to uplift Hinduism. I regard the untouchables as an integral
part of the Hindu community. I am pained when I see a single <i>Bhangi
</i>driven out of the fold of Hinduism. But do not believe that all
class distinctions can be obliterated. I believe in the  doctrine of
equality as taught by Lord Krishna in the <i>Gita</i>. The <i>Gita
</i>teaches us that members of all the four castes should be treated
on an equal basis. It does not prescribe the same dharma for the
Brahmin as for the <i>Bhangi</i>. But it insists that the latter
shall be entitled to the same measure of consideration and esteem as
the former with all  his superior learning. It is therefore our duty
to see that the untouchables do not feel that they are despised or
looked down upon. Let them not be offered leavings from our plates
for their subsistence. How can I accord differential treatment to any
person, be he Brahmin or Bhangi, who worships the same God and keeps
his body and soul pure and clean? I for one would regard myself as
having sinned if I gave to a <i>Bhangi </i>unclean food from the
leavings from the kitchen or failed to render him personal assistance
when he was in need.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Let me make my position absolutely clear. While I do hold that the
institution of untouchability as it stands today has no sanction in
Hinduism, Hinduism does recognize “untouchability” in a limited</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
sense and under certain circumstances. For instance, every time that
my mother handled unclean things she became untouchable for the time
being and had to cleanse herself by bathing. As a <i>Vaishnava </i>I
refuse to believe that anyone can be regarded untouchable by reason
of his or her birth, and such untouchability as is  recognized  by
religion is by its very nature transitory, easily removable and
referable to the deed not the doer. Not only that. Just as we revere
our mother for the sanitary service that she renders us when we are
infants, and the greater her service the greater is our reverence for
her, similarly the <i>Bhangis </i>are entitled to our highest
reverence for the sanitary service they perform for society.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now anoter point. I do not regard inter-dining and inter- marriage as
essential to the removal of untouchability. I believe in <i>varnashrama
</i>dharma. But I eat with <i>Bhangis</i>. I do not know whether I am
a sannyasi, for it seriously doubt whether in this <i>Kaliyuga </i>it
is at all possible for anyone to fulfil the conditions prescribed for
a sannyasi. But I am moving deliberately in the direction of
<i>sannyasa</i>. It is, therefore, not only not necessary for me to
observe these restrictions but their observance may be even harmful
for me. As regards the question of inter-marriage, it does not arise
in cases like mine. Sufficient for me to say that my scheme does not
include inter- marriage. Let me tell you that in my own clan all the
members do not inter-dine. In certain cases among our <i>Vaishnava
</i>families they do not use each other’s utensils or even cook
food on fire fetched from others’ kitchens. You may call this
practice superstitious, but I do not regard it as such. It certainly
does no harm to Hinduism. In my Ashram, Dudhabhai, one of the
untouchable inmates, dines with the rest without any distinction. But
I do not recommend anybody outside the Ashram to follow this example.
Again, you know the esteem in which I hold Malaviyaji. I would wash
his feet. But he would not take food touched by me. Am I to resent it
as a mark of contempt? Certainly not, because I know that no contempt
is meant.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The religion to which I belong prescribes for our observance <i>maryada</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup><i>dharma</i>.
The  <i>rishis</i><i> </i>of old carried on exhaustive researches
through meditation, and as a result of the researches they discovered
some great truths, such as have no parallel perhaps in any other
religion. One of these was that they regarded certain kinds of foods
as injurious for the spiritual well-being of man. So they interdicted

use. Now suppose someone had to travel abroad and live among strange
people with different customs and standards as regard their diet.
Knowing as they did how compelling sometimes the force of social
customs of the people among whom men lived was, they promulgated
<i>maryada dharma </i>to help one in such emergencies. Though,
however, I believe in <i>maryada dharma</i>, I do not regard it as an
essential part of Hinduism. I can even conceive a time when these
restrictions might be abolished with impunity. But the reform
contemplated in the untouchability movement does not obliterate the
restriction as to inter-dining and inter-marriage. I cannot recommend
wholesale abolition of these restrictions to the public, even at the
risk of being charged with hypocrisy and inconsistency. For instance,
I let my son dine freely in Mussalman households because I believe he
can take sufficient care as to what to take and what not to take. I
myself have no scruples in taking my food in Mussalman  house-holds
because I have my own strict rules about my diet. Let me tell you of
an incident that happened at Aligarh. Swami Satyadev and I were
Khawaja Sahib’s guests. Swami Satyadev did not share my views. We
argued about them. I told him that holding the views I did, it would
be as wrong of me to refuse to partake of the food offered by a
Mussalman as it would be on his part to transgress his <i>maryada</i>.
So Swami Satyadev was provided with separate cooking arrangements.
Similarly when I was Bari Sahib’s guest he provided us with  a 
Brahmin cook with strict instructions to obtain all the rations for
us fresh from the bazaar. When asked why he put himself to such
inconvenience he explained that he did so because he wanted to avoid
the slightest possibility of suspicion on the part of the public that
he entertained any secret designs of proselytization against me or my
companions. That single incident raised Bari Sahib in my esteem. He
sometimes commits mistakes, but he is as simple and innocent as a
child. And although sometimes people complain of him to me bitterly,
my first impression of him still remains.</p>

I have dwelt on this point at such great length, because I want to be
absolutely plain with you (untouchables). I do not want to employ
diplomacy in my dealings with you or for that matter with anyone. I
do not want to keep you under any false illusion or win your support
by holding out temptations. I want to remove untouchability because
its removal is essential for swaraj and  I  want  swaraj.  But  I 
would not exploit you for gaining any political ends of mine. The
issue with me is bigger even than swaraj. I am anxious to see an end

not the untouchables whose <i>shuddhi </i>I effect—the thing would

That being so, it follows that the only means open to me for my
purpose are those of ahimsa and truth. I have adopted an untouchable
child as my own. I confess I have not been able to convert my wife
completely to my view. She cannot bring hereself to love her as I do.
But I cannot convert my wife by anger; I can do so only by love. If
any of my people have done you any wrong, I ask your forgiveness for
it. Some members of the untouchable class said when I was at Poona
that they would resort to force if the Hindus did not alter their
attitude towards them. Can untouchability be removed by force? Can
the amelioration of the untouchables come through these methods? The
only way by which you and I can wean orthodox Hindus from their
bigotry is by patient argument and correct conduct. So long as they
are not converted, I can only ask you to put up with your lot with
patience. I am willing to stand by you and share your sufferings with
you. You must have the right of worship in any temple in which
members of other castes are admitted. You must have admission to
schools along with the children of other castes without any
distinction. You must be eligible to the highest office in the land
not excluding even that of the Viceroy’s. That is my definition of
the removal of untouchability.</p>

But I can help you in this only by following the way indicated by my
religion and not by following Western methods. For that way I cannot
save Hinduism. Yours is a sacred cause. Can one serve a sacred cause
by adopting Satan’s methods? I pray you, therefore, to dismiss from
your mind the idea of ameliorating your condition by brute force. The
<i>Gita </i>tells us that by sincerely meditating on the Lord in
one’s heart, one can attain <i>moksha</i>. Meditation is waiting on
God. If waiting on God brings the highest bliss of salvation, how
much quicker must it bring removal of untouchability? Waiting on God
means increasing purity. Let us by prayer purify ourselves and we
shall not only remove untouchability but shall also hasten the advent
of swaraj.</p>

I hold the question of cow-protection to be not less momentous but in
certain respects even of far greater moment than that of swaraj. I
would even go so far as to say that just as so long as Hindu-Muslim
unity is not effected, Hinduism not purged of the taint of untoucha-
bility and the wearing of hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar does not
become universal, swaraj would be impossible of attainment; even so,
the term “swaraj” would be devoid of all meaning so long as we
have not found out a way of saving the cow, for that is the
touchstone on which Hinduism must be tested and proved before there
can be any real swaraj in India. I claim to be a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu.
People may laugh and say that to call myself a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu
when I eat and drink from the hands of Mussalmans and Christians,
keep an untouchable girl in my house as my daughter and do not even
hesitate to quote the Bible, is nothing short of doing violence to
language. But  I would still adhere to my claim, for I have faith in
me which tells me that a day would come—may be most probably after
I am dead and no longer present in this world in the flesh to bear
witness—when my critics would recognize their error and admit the
justness of my claim. Pretty long while ago, I once wrote in <i>Young
</i><i>India </i>an article on Hinduism,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>which
I consider to be one of my most thoughtful writings on the subject.
The definition of Hinduism which I gave in it is probably the
clearest that I have ever given. After defining a Hindu as one who
believed in the Vedas and Upanishads, recited the <i>Gayatri </i>and
subscribed to the doctrine of rebirth and transmigration, etc., I
added that so far as the popular notion of Hinduism was concerned,
its distinguishing feature was belief in cow-protection and reverence
for the cow. I do not grant to be told as to what Hindus ten thousand
years ago did. I know there are scholars who tell us that
cow-sacrifice is mentioned in the Vedas. I remember when I was a high
school student we read a sentence in our Sanskrit text-book to the
effect that the Brahmins of old used to eat beef. That exercised my
mind greatly and I used to wonder and ask myself whether what was
written could</p>

be after all true. But as I grew up the conviction slowly forced
itself upon me that even if the text on which these statements were
based was actually part of the Vedas, the interpretation put upon it
could not be correct. I had conceived of another way out of the
difficulty. This was purely for personal satisfaction.“If the Vedic
text under reference was incapable of bearing any other
interpretation than the literal”, I said to myself, “the Brahmins
who there alleged to be eating beef had the power to bring the
slaughtered animals back to life again.” But that is neither here
nor there. The speculation does not concern the general mass of the
Hindus. I do not claim to be a Vedic scholar. I have read Sanskrit
scriptures largely in translation. A layman like myself, therefore,
can hardly have any <i>locus standi </i>in a controversy like this.
But l have confidence in myself. Therefore I do not hesitate to
freely express to others my opinions based on  my  inner experience.
It may be that we may not be all able to agree as to the exact
meaning and significance of cow-protection. For Hinduism does not
rest on the authority of one book or one prophet; nor does it possess
a common creed—like the <i>Kalm</i><i>a</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
Islam—acceptable to all. That renders a common definition of
Hinduism a bit difficult, but therein lies its strength also. For, it
is this special feature that has given to Hinduism its inclusive and
assimilative character and made its grad- ual, silent evolution
possible. Go to any Hindu child and he would tell you that
cow-protection is the supreme duty of every Hindu and that anyone who
does not believe in it hardly deserves the name of a Hindu.</p>

But while I am a firm believer in the necessity and importance of
cow-protection, I do not at all endorse  the  current  methods 
adopted for that purpose. Some of the practices followed in the name
of cow-protection cause me extreme anguish. My heart aches within me.

Once, while in Champaran, I was asked to expound my views regarding
cow-protection. I told my Champaran friends then that if anybody was
really anxious to save the cow, he ought once for all to disabuse his
mind of the notion that he had to make the Christians and Mussalmans
to desist from cow-killing. Unfortunately today we seem to believe
that the problem of cow-protection consists merely in preventing
non-Hindus, especially Mussalmans from beef-eating and cow-killing.
That seems to me to be absurd. Let no one, however, conclude from
this that I am indifferent when a non-Hindu kills a cow or that I can
bear the practice of cow-killing. On the contrary, no one probably
experiences a greater agony of the soul when a cow is killed. But
what am I to do? Am I to fulfil my dharma myself or am I to get it
fulfilled by proxy? Of what avail would be my preaching <i>brahmacharya
</i>to others if I am at the same time steeped in vice myself? How
can I ask Mussalmans to desist from eating beef when I eat it myself?
But supposing even that I myself do not kill the cow, is it any part
of my duty to make the Mussalman, against his will, to do likewise?
Mussalmans claim that Islam permits them to kill the cow. To make a
Mussalman, therefore, to abstain from cow-killing under compulsion
would amount in my opinion to converting him to Hinduism by force.
Even in India under swaraj, in my opinion, it would be for a Hindu
majority unwise and improper to coerce by legislation a Mussalman
minority into submission to statutory prohibition of cow-slaughter.
When I pledge myself to save the cow, I do not mean merely the Indian
cow, but the cow all the world over. My religion teaches me that I
should by my personal conduct instill into the minds of those who
might hold different views, the conviction that cow-killing is a sin
and that therefore it ought to be abandoned. My ambition is no less
than to see the principle of cow-protection established throughout
the world. But that requires that I should set my own house
thoroughly in order first.</p>

Let alone other provinces. Would you believe me if I told you that
the Hindus of Gujarat practice cow-killing? You will wonder but let
me tell you that in Gujarat the bullocks employed for drawing carts
are goaded with spiked rods till blood oozes from their bruised
backs. You may say that this is not cow-killing but bullock-killing.
But I see no difference between the two, the killing of the cow and
killing her male progeny. Again you may say that this practice may be
abominable and worthy of condemnation but it hardly amounts to
killing. But here, again, I beg to differ. If the bullock in question
had a tongue to speak and were asked which fate he prepared—instanta-
neous death under the butcher’s knife or the long-drawn agony to
which he is subjected, he would undoubtedly prefer the former. At
Calcutta a Sindhi gentleman used to meet me often. He used always to
tell me stories about the cruelty that was practised by milk-men on
cows in Calcutta. He asked me to see for myself  the  process  of
milking the cows as carried on in the dairies. The practice of
blowing is loathsome. The people who do this are Hindus. Again,
nowhere in the world is the condition of cattle so poor as in India.
Nowhere in the world would you find such skeletons of cows and
bullocks as you do in our cow-worshipping India. Nowhere are bullocks
worked so  beyond their capacity as here. I contend that so long as
these things continue, we have no right to ask anybody to stop
cow-killing. In <i>Bhagavata, </i>in one place the illustrious author
describes the various things which have been the cause of India’s
downfall. One of the causes mentioned is that we have given up
cow-protection. Today I want to bring home to you if I can the close
relation which exists between the present poverty-stricken condition
of India  and  our failure to protect the cow. We, who live in
cities, probably can have no idea of the extent of the poverty of our
poor folk. Millions upon millions cannot afford to have two full
meals per day. Some live on rotten rice only. There are others for
whom salt and chillies are the only table luxuries. Is it not a just
nemesis for our belying of our religion?</p>

If, therefore, I am asked how to save the cow, my first advice will
be: “Dismiss from your minds the Mussalmans and Christians
altogether and mind your duty first.” I have been telling Maulana
Shaukat Ali all along that I was helping him to save his cow, i.e.,
the Khilafat, because I hoped to save my cow thereby. I am prepared
to place my life in the hands of the Mussalmans, to live merely on
their sufferance. Why? Simply that I might be able to protect the
cow. I hope to achieve the end not by entering into a bargain with
the Mussalmans but by bringing about a change of heart in them. So
long as this is not done I hold my soul in patience. For I have not a
shadow of doubt in my mind that such a change of heart can be brought
about only by our own correct conduct towards them and by our
personal example.</p>

Cow-slaughter and man-slaughter are in my opinion the two sides of
the same coin. And the remedy for both is identical, i.e., that we
develop the ahimsa principle and endeavour to win over our opponents
by love. The test of love is <i>tapasya </i>and <i>tapasya </i>means
suffering. I offered to share with the Mussalmans their suffering to
the best of my capacity not merely because I wanted their
co-operation for winning swaraj but also because I had in mind the
object of saving the cow. The Koran, so far as I have been able to
understand it, declares it to be a sin to take the life of any living
being without cause. I want to develop the capacity to convince the
Mussalmans that to kill the cow is practically to kill their
fellow-countrymen and friends—the Hindus. The Koran says that there
can be no heaven for one who sheds the blood of an innocent
neighbour. Therefore I am anxious to establish the best neighbourly
relations with the Mussalmans. I scrupulously avoid doing anything
that might hurt their feelings. I even try to respect their
prejudices. But I do this not in a spirit of bargain, I ask them for
no reward. For that I look to God only. My <i>Gita</i><i> </i>tells
me that evil can never result from a good action. Therefore I</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
must help the Mussalmans from a pure sense  of duty—without making
any terms with them. For more cows are killed today for the sake of
Englishmen in India than for the Mussalmans. I want to  convert the
former also. I would like to convince them that whilst they are in
our midst their duty lies in getting rid of their Western culture to
the extent that it comes in conflict with ours. You will thus see
that even our self-interest requires us to observe ahimsa. By ahimsa
we will be able to save the cow and also to win the friendship of the
English. I want to purchase the friendship of all by sacrifice. But
if I do not approach the English on bent knees, as I do the
Mussalmans, that is because the former are intoxicated with power.
The Mussalman is a fellow-sufferer in slavery. We can therefore speak
to him as a friend and a comrade. The Englishman on the contrary is
unable  to appreciate our friendly advances. He would spurn them. He
does not care for our friendship, he wants to patronize us. We want
neither his insults nor his patronage. We therefore let him alone.
Our Shastras have laid down that charity should be given only to  a 
deserving  person, that knowledge should be imparted only to one who 
is  desirous of having it. So we content ourselves with
non-co-operating with our rulers—not out of hatred but in a spirit
of love. It  was because love was the motive force behind non-co-
operation that I advised suspension of civil disobedience when
violence broke out in Bombay and Chauri Chaura. I wanted to make it
clear to Englishmen that I wanted to win swaraj not by shedding their
blood but by making them feel absolutely at ease as regards the
safety of their persons. What profit would it be if I succeed in
saving a few cows from death by using force against persons who do
not regard cow-killing as  sinful? Cow-protection then can only be
secured by cultivating universal friendliness, i.e., ahimsa. Now you
will understand why I regard the question of cow-protection as
greater even than that of swaraj. The fact is that the capacity to
achieve the former will suffice for the latter purpose as well.</p>

So far I have confined myself to the grosser or material aspect of
cow-protection, i.e., the aspect that refers to the animal cow only.
In its finer or spiritual sense the term cow-protection means the
protection of every living creature. Today the world does not fully
realize the force and possibilities that lie hidden in ahimsa. The
scriptures of Christians, Mussalmans and Hindus are all replete with
the teaching of ahimsa. But we do not know its full import. The
<i>rishis </i>of old performed terrible penances and austerities to
discover the right</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
meaning of sacred texts. Today we have at least two interpretations
of the <i>Gayatri</i>. Which one of them is correct, that of the
<i>sanatanis </i>or that of the Arya Samajists? Who can say? But our
<i>rishis </i>made the startling discovery (and every day I feel more
and more convinced of its truth) that sacred texts and inspired
writings yield their truth only in proportion as one has advanced in
the practice of ahimsa and truth. The greater the realization of
truth and ahimsa, the greater the illumination. These same <i>rishis
</i>declared that cow-protection was the supreme duty of a Hindu and
that its performance brought one <i>moksha</i>, i.e., salvation. Now
I am not ready to believe that by merely protecting the animal cow,
one can attain <i>moksha</i>. For <i>moksha </i>one must completely
get rid of one’s lower feelings like attachment, hatred, anger,
jealousy, etc. It follows, therefore, that the meaning of
cow-protection in terms of <i>moksha </i>must be much wider and far
more comprehensive than is commonly supposed. The cow-protection
which can bring one <i>moksha </i>must, from its very nature, include
the protection of everything that feels. Therefore in my opinion,
every little breach of the ahimsa principle, like causing hurt by
harsh speech to anyone, man, woman or child, to cause pain to the
weakest and the most insignificant creature on earth would be a
breach of the principle of cow-protection, would be tantamount to the
sin of beef-eating— differing from it in degree, if at all, rather
than in kind. That being so,  I hold that with all our passions let
loose we cannot today claim to be following the principle of
cow-protection.</p>

At Lahore I met Lala Dhanpatrai, somewhat of a crank like myself. He
told me that if I wanted to save the cow I should wean the Hindus
from their false notions. He said, it was Hindus who sold cows to the
Mussalman butcher and but for them the latter would have no cows to
kill. The reason for this practice he told me was economical. The
village commons that served as grazing grounds for the cattle had
been enclosed by the Government and so people could not afford to
keep cows. He suggested a way out of the difficulty. It was no longer
necessary, he told me to sell cows that had ceased to give milk. He
himself, he said, had tried the experiment of buying such cows. He
then put them to the plough. After some time, if proper care was
taken, they put on flesh and became fit to bear again. I cannot vouch
for the truth of this statement. But I see no reason why this
practice should not be generally adopted if the facts are as stated
by Lala Dhanpatrai. Our Shastras certainly have nowhere said that
under no circumstances should the cow not be used for draught
purposes. If we</p>

feed the cow properly, tend it carefully and then use her for drawing
carts or working the ploughs always taking care not to tax her beyond
her capacity, there can be nothing wrong in it. I therefore commend
the suggestion for consideration and adoption if it is found to be
workable. We may not look down upon a person if he tries to protect
the cow in this manner.</p>

I am overwhelmed with the affection which is shown to me by all
during the past few days. Today the president of your Conference in
adjourning the address to give me an opportunity to speak a few words
to you has given further proof of it. You may know that I was born in
an Indian village. I know Kathiawar States. My relations with them
are cordial. Though I say little I am always  watching  the
activities in the Indian States. In my Presidential Address I have
made a reference to the Indian States. The All Parties Conference
that met recently in Bombay has appointed a committee to draft a
scheme of swaraj and in my address I have outlined my ideas of the
coming swaraj. I had to condense my ideas in the shortest space
possible and so I could give very few sentences to the Indian States.
There are some <i>vakil </i>friends of mine who have something to say
about this reference of mine to the Indian States. They are saying
that I have spoken about the status of Indian princes and chiefs and
nothing about their obligations towards their subjects. But I need
not remind these friends of mine that rights always carry with them
corresponding obligations. In my scheme of Indian swaraj there is no
idea of destroying the States. I wanted to bring out this view
prominently before the public. If, however, subjects from Indian
States migrated to British Indian territory owing to the oppression
of any Indian Prince, the swaraj government will on no account hand
over these people to the mercies of the Prince concerned. This
guarantee to the subject and the guarantee to the Princes about their
status postulate good  government</p>

In geometry there are certain postulates. So also there are some in
the political science. When the Princes are guaranteed their status
it is presumed that they will also guarantee progressive and
enlightened government to their subjects. I am shortly to preside
over the Kathia- war States Conference at Bhavnagar and I have
reserved all my  detailed say about the Indian States for this
occasion. I was invited to preside over this Conference long ago. But
before my incarceration I had unfurled the banner of satyagraha and I
thought that my acceptance of the presidentship of any of these
conferences might jeopardize the position of the Chiefs. I did not
wish to put them in an awkward position and thus to mar the
harmonious relations which existed between them and me. You know that
I am an out-and-out believer in non-violence. To embitter the sweet
relations between Princes and their subjects would be contrary to my
principles. But I need not assure you that I can never forget the
people of these States and their legitimate claims. My desire is to
maintain sweet reasonableness in my handling the question of Indian
States and I do not wish to prejudice any party. My sole desire is
that the status of Princes and the rights of their subjects should be
respected. I earnestly wish to enlist the sympathies of the Princes
in this propaganda of khadi and the Charkha. I have pinned my faith
to the spinning-wheel. On it I believe the salvation of this country
depends.</p>

	Whatever I was to say I said in the Congress. I do not know whether

	There was a time when satyagraha was going on in South Africa and

	At the  same  time  Lord  Hardinge  made  a  pronouncement  in

Gangadharrao Deshpande and his band of workers rose to the highest
height. His Vijayanagar was a triumph—not yet of swaraj— but
certainly of  organisation.  Every  detail  was  well  thought  out.
Dr. Hardikar’s volunteers were smart and attentive. The roads were
broad and well kept. They could easily be broader for the conven-
ience of the temporary shops and the easy movement of thousands of
sight-seers. The lighting arrangement was perfect. The huge pavilion
with a marble fountain in front of it seemed to invite all who would
enter it. The capacity of the pavilion could not be less than
seventeen thousand. The sanitary arrangements though quite good
needed still more scientific treatment than what they had. The method
of the disposal of used water was very primitive. I invite  the 
Cawnpore people who are to have the honour of holding the Congress
session of 1925 to study the most effective methods of camp
sanitation now and not leave this very important part to the eleventh
hour.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Whilst I am able to give ungrudging praise  for  the  almost perfect
organization that one could see in the Congress camp, I cannot help
remarking that Gangadharrao could not escape the temptation of making
the outside look lavish and in following the traditional custom of
going in for extravagant luxuries for the “people at the top”.
Take the presidential “hut”. I had bargained for a khaddar hut;
but I was insulted with a khaddar palace. The floor space reserved
for the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
President was certainly quite necessary The fence round the “palace”
was an absolute necessity for my protection from embarrassingly
admiring crowds. But I am sure that, had I been contractor, I would
have given the same space and the same comfort to the President at
half the expense. This however is only one instance of the many I can
quote of lavish expenditure. The refreshments supplied to  the
members of the Subjects Committee and others were unnecessarily
lavish. There was no sense of proportion observed as to the
quantities served. I am finding fault with nobody. The extravagance
came from a generous heart. It was all well meant. Forty years’
tradition cannot be undone in a day, especially if no one likely to
gain a hearing will repeatedly criticize it. I know, when I suggested
to Vallabhbhai in 1921 that he should make a beginning, he retorted
by saying that whilst he would try to attain simplicity and avoid
extravagance, he would not allow his pet Gujarat to be considered
miserly. I could not persuade him that if he did not have a temporary
fountain costing several thousand rupees he would not be considered
miserly. I told him too that whatever he did was bound to be copied
by  his  successors. Vallabhbhai would not take the odium of being
considered miserly. I advise Cawnpore to lead the way. The miser-
liness of Cawnpore may be considered the extravagance of tomorrow.
There were many things Vallabhbhai did discard. I did not hear any
remarks about the disappearance of the things that were really not a
felt want.</p>

Let us remember that the Congress is intended to represent the
poorest toilers who are the salt of India. Our scale must be so far
as possible adjusted to theirs. We must therefore be progressively
econo- mical without being inefficient and stingy.</p>

In my opinion the charges for accommodation and food are much too
heavy, We may do worse than take a lesson from the book of Swami
Shraddhanandji. I remember the sheds he built  for  his guests who
came for the Gurukul anniversary in 1916. He built grass sheds for
them at a cost (I think) of about Rs. 2,000. He invited contractors
to open restaurants on the ground and made no charge for the
accommodation. No one could complain of the  arrangement.  They knew
what they were to expect. Nearly 40,000 people were thus accommodated
on the Gurukul ground  without  the  slightest difficulty and with
practically no expense. And what is more each visitor received what
he wanted and was at liberty to live cheaply or</p>

extravagantly.</p>

I do not say that the Swami’s plan should be copied in its
entirety. But I do suggest that better and cheaper plans are impera-
tively necessary. The reduction of the delegate’s fees from Rs. 10
to 1 was  universally  acclaimed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

would be I am sure still more appreciated.</p>

The source of income should be a small entrance fee levied from every
spectator. The Congress must be an annual fair where visitors may
come and get instruction with amusement. The deliber- ative part
should be an item round which the demonstrative progr- amme should
turn. It therefore should take place in decent time, as this year,
and the appointments must be religiously observed.</p>

I am not sure that the packing of all other conferences into one week
serves any national purpose. In my opinion only those conferences
should take place during the Congress week that aid and strengthen
the Congress. The President and his “ Cabinet” must not be
expected to give their attention to anything but Congress work. I
know that, if there had been no other call upon my time, I could have
better attended to the charge entrusted to me. I had not a moment
left to me for contemplation. I was unable to frame the necessary
recommendations for making the franchise a success. The fact is that
the organizers of various conferences do not take their tasks
seriously. They hold them because it has become the fashion to do so.
I would urge workers in various directions to avoid the annual
dissipation of energy.</p>

The exhibition of indigenous arts and industries is an institution

that thousands must have enjoyed. The lantern lectures tracing the
tragic history of the ruin of the greatest national industry and the

I tender my congratulations to Satish Babu upon the thoughtful and
thorough manner in which he organized these lectures. The spinning

One thing I must not omit before I close these impressions. There
were nearly seventy-five volunteers, mostly Brahmins, who were
engaged in conservancy work in the Congress camp. The municipal
<i>Bhangis </i>were indeed taken, but it was thought necessary to
have the volunteers also. Kaka Kalelkar who was in charge of this
corps tells me that this part of the work would not have been done as
satisfactorily as it was, if the corps had not been formed. He tells
me too that the volunteers worked most willingly. Not one  of  them
shirked the work which ordinarily very few would be prepared to
undertake. And yet it is the noblest of all from one point of view.
Indeed sanitary work must be regarded as the foundation of all
volunteer training.</p>

The Congress has taken a tremendous forward step or as some say
committed a tremendous folly at the instance of a mad man.
Congressmen, whether willing spinners or unwilling, have to justify
the step taken by working the spinning franchise That work which some
were doing is now transferred to everyone who wishes to belong to the
Congress. It is methodical labour that the Congress requires from

hire it.</p>

The task is obviously difficult. If it were easy, it would not be
possible to expect the grand result one expects from its successful
working. Even when it was a mere matter of collecting four annas per
year, the task was found to be difficult. And today we have not, on
the Congress register, in all the provinces fifty thousand such
members. Now the Congress expects everyone to spin 2,000 yards per
month or to get that quantity spun for him by another. Thus the
workers have to keep in continuous touch with the spinners. Therein
lies  in  my opinion the strength of the franchise. It gives the
people political education of a high type.</p>

The way to ensure success for every province is to fix the minimum of
voters it expects to secure and not to rest till that number is
secured. Now throughout India at the lowest computation there are at
least five million wheels working. These spinners can all easily
belong to the Congress. Those who are taking work from them can now
invite them to devote half an hour of their time to the nation by
spinning at the wheel for that time. This does not require new
organizing. Cotton slivers, etc., are there. All that is necessary is
for the organization to make a gift to the Congress of the slivers
required to be supplied to the spinners for voluntary or franchise
spinning. All that is required of spinners is to give the Congress
free labour needed to spin 2,000 yards of yarn. Then there is the
voluntary spinning by non-professional spinners. Those who are now
spinning have to ask their friends and neighbour to do likewise and
become Congress members. This can be best done by each worker
founding spinning clubs of twenty. To be efficient these clubs must
be small and compact. The first member must be a proficient carder
and spinner. For on him, in the first instance, will fall the burden
of collecting cotton, carding it, slivering it and distributing the
slivers among the members of the club. The third class of work is to
provide for the unwilling spinners. The honest unwilling spinner will
naturally seek out a member of his own family to do the spinning for
him. He then ensures the contribution of good and true hand-spun
yarn. The next class of unwilling member will himself engage a
professional spinner to spin for him. And the last class is that
which will buy its yarn from the market and run the risk of having
spurious yarn sold for genuine. For the sake of the common cause I
would warn the Congressmen who are unwilling against the last method.
Registration of membership for the last class is easy and, if many
avail themselves of it, the practice will open the floodgates of
fraud and may cause an injury to a cottage industry that is
struggling to make headway against enormous odds. My hope is that
there will be very few men and women who will be unwilling to spin
for the sake of the Congress and the country. The word “unwilling”
has found place in the franchise for the sake of meeting the
difficulties of those who are old Congressmen and whom I would not
like to leave the Congress, even if they were willing to do so. But I
shall hope that unwillingness will not be encouraged. Mere production
of hand-spun yarn will not make the idle and the starving work. It is
the atmosphere of manual work, and that too consisting of
hand-spinning, that is required to make the millions retake to the
wheel. And that atmosphere can best be produced by all Congressmen
regarding it as an honour for themselves personally to spin.</p>

The note containing the promise was passed to me by Sjt. Tulsiram at

charkhas means, of course, as many members. If the city of Madura can

Another promise still more important is made by Maulana Zafar Ali
Khan. He has solemnly promised that he will have got twenty-five
thousand Mussalman spinners as members by the end of my term of
office. The Maulana will deserve the highest congratulations, if he
succeeds. Not that twenty-five thousand Mussalman members from the
Punjab is by any means a large number, if the thing catches. But,
when so many are prognosticating a catastrophe, for the Maulana to
make the solemn promise is in my opinion a wonderful thing. I have
told the Maulana that, if he breaks the promise, I shall have to fast
against him. He retorted by saying, he did not want me to commit
suicide and that he would not have made the promise, if he had not
meant it or its fulfilment was impossible. I invite such promises
from every province. But no one need make them in a fit of
enthusiasm. Mere promises mean nothing if there is not an unalterable
resolution behind them. I know that during the War the authorities
used to apportion work for each province, and the provinces had to
supply the quota of men or money as the case might be. In that case
the supply was fixed for them and default carried penalties of a kind
with it. Should the provinces do less because they are called upon to
fix their own quota and because breach of promise will carry no
penalty with it?</p>

I do not want any Gujarati to take advantage of the freedom to
unwilling persons given in the resolution on spinning. I see some
divine purpose in my release from Yeravda Prison on account of my
illness. Providence, it seems, has set me free that I might move
through the length and breadth of the country speaking about 
<i>Annapoorna</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, the spinning-wheel, and taking it everywhere. If India
would still not respond to the call of spinning, her privations would
multiply. It will be no pleasure to me to find Dohad converted into
Bombay and half a dozen of its people become millionaires. Everyone
has the right to earn food and clothing. But no one has a right to
accumulate wealth and be rich. I would not have a handful of you
become money-lenders. I would, however, wish that khadi should be
sold as easily as ghee and made current everywhere like coins and
postal stamps. For those who cannot themselves spin there is a
provision to get others to do it for them and thus become eligible
for membership But I would urge that no one from Gujarat may take
advantage of this provision. Sukhdev tells me he has discontinued
spinning. I did not know it. He might be otherwise busy but his
discontinuation of spinning is intolerable. It would be a miserable
plight if our workers themselves do not spin. It is not as if Sukhdev
does not approve of spinning, it is only his laziness. I won’t have
this excuse from any Gujarati.</p>

advised him to plant himself firmly in Godhra. Subsequently I went to
jail and Vallabhbhai took upon  himself the heavy burden of
administration. It was then that the house was built. I do not like
it. It is not that it is incomplete but it does us no credit. It does
not want in elegance but it should be such as to do us credit. Mama
is not an architect but his heart is filled with love and piety. He
was drawn by his love towards <i>Antyajas </i>and spent Rs. 20,000.
Vallabhbhai could not collect that amount. But fortunately Parsi
Rustomjee had given money for work of this kind. Some of it was
appropriated for the house which has been built. But that ought to be
suitable for us, the <i>Antyaja</i>, the poor. We are all poor people

no right to such buildings, even though we may try to convert them

those where we wash off our sins and make ready to swim to the other

gurus holiness incarnate? If we serve people with all our heart, we
become purified. Do not imagine that you have been polluted and that
you should bathe. If you had not known that those who treated you to
the dialogues were <i>Antyaja </i>boys, would you have believed it?
If we exert ourselves to the utmost over these children, they may

leaving the Antyaja Seva Mandal,   I thought of entrusting it to the
Vidyapith. Amritlal said, we should not let it go. He took the burden
upon himself. But how much burden can a single person carry? You
should also help him. There is a great deal of work for the Antyaja
Seva Mandal to do. The <i>Antyaja </i>map of Gujarat is being drawn.
I do not know that Godhra has contributed a single paisa. If the Lord
indeed dwells within you, then send the money to Amritlal or Mama.
And let your mind go with the money.</p>

It is not religion but rather its very opposite to regard the
outcastes as untouchables by birth. I am convinced that those who do
not regard me a <i>sanatani </i>are ignorant. You will say there are
pandits who defend untouchability. But the words of Akha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>that
“learning without thinking is futile” apply to them. There is a
kind of untouchability in Hinduism, namely, that of keeping away from
the impure, that is, from wicked, fraudulent, lustful or unchaste
persons. Look upon them as untouchables and run away from them; but
would you run away from the person who serves you, who removes your
filth, who tans your leather and forges your farming tools and regard
him as an untouchable? This is hypocrisy, not Hinduism. I would ask
you to shun them if Hinduism did indeed teach that they were
untouchables. This idea that Hinduism teaches untouchability is only
an illusion. If you were compassionate, the ignorance among <i>Bhangis
</i>would make you weep and you would be awakened to your
ownresponsibilities. If you abandon me, drive me away cruelly and, as
 a result, I turn mad, is it my fault or yours? In like manner, is it
through their fault or yours that the poor <i>Bhangis </i>and <i>Dheds
</i>are penniless and destitute, their ignorance is abysmal and they
are given to addictions? The fault is certainly yours and I wish you
to remove it and purify yourselves.</p>

I see a great purpose in God saving me from a serious illness in
Yeravada Prison and releasing me for your service. The purpose is
that I should come to you and give you self-confidence, put before
you the fruit of profound meditation in prison, namely, the key to
swaraj lies in fulfilling three conditions alone—in the
spinning-wheel, in Hindu-Muslim unity and in the removal of
untouchability. The reason that I have mentioned the spinning-wheel
first is that amongst these three, we are sceptical about it alone
and, secondly because it is the spinning-wheel alone which demands
from us honest daily work. If I wish to work half an hour a day for
Hindu-Muslim unity or removal of untouchability, I would be hard put
to it to imagine what to do. But the plying of the spinning-wheel for
half an hour is concrete work. It is an inanimate object, but there
is an irresistible power behind it. I ask everyone to get ready to
activate it. You find</p>

khadi coarse. If you say that khadi irritates your skin, it would
amount to saying that this country irritates you. And, how can he,
whom his country irritates, win swaraj? Tilak Maharaj used to say
that he was pained when he heard anyone talk of going abroad for a
change of climate. Since God ordained my birth here, would He not
have provided that I should keep healthy in this climate? Although it
is bitterly cold in England, do the English run away from their
country? They light fires in their homes, put on woollen clothes, and
take all precautions. What do the multimillionaires do here? They
think of a change of climate. I tell you that this is a grave error
on their part. In like manner, our patrio-tism consists in wearing
indigenous khadi, whether it is expensive or cheap, good or bad,
coarse or fine; otherwise it is meaningless to speak of one’s
motherland. Would any mother abandon her own ugly child and take into
her lap another’s comely child? I hope that you would have the same
God-given love and affection for India, for the grain that is grown
here and for khadi. If every man in Godhra produced khadi worth five
rupees, how much money would a population of 25,000 save? If that
amount is saved, the people of Godhra would become to that extent
prosperous. You will become stronger and your patriotism will shine
forth. The spinning-wheel alone is a thing which enables all—men,
womenand children, the rich and the poor—to contribute equally and 
which brings about great good. Remember the saying that drop by drop
fills the lake and keep filling the lake of swaraj by contributing
two thousand yards of yarn. Do you believe that you will win swaraj
by Vamanrao’s going to the Legislative Assembly and glaring at the
Government? I would then ask you to go and talk of yarn and khadi
even there. If, however, you cannot boycott foreign-cloth, swaraj
will not be won even by Vallabhbhai or five thousand persons like
Vamanrao entering the Legislative Assembly.</p>

Circumstances take me to kathiawar. I know and understand the

As I had nothing new to place before the Congress, so too, I shall
have nothing new to say to Kathiawar. The truth is that I have
already said what I have to say. Somehow I have to repeat the same

swaraj for the <i>Bhangis</i>, for the labourers. I keep thinking of
how to make them happy. When shall we get off their backs? While we

The organizers have undertaken to prepare the atmosphere for me. They
will certainly show me that the whole place is full of khadi. They
will certainly have an exhibition of the arts and crafts of
Kathiawar. What a beautiful exhibition was held in Belgaum! There is
no dearth of art in Kathiawar. There is nothing lacking in its flora.
What beautiful cattle there are in Kathiawar! Shall I have a glimpse
of these? I do not wish to see the glorification of the West. I have
seen enough of it there. On the contrary, I am trying to recall
Indian things which have been neglected. It is these I wish to see.</p>

The Congress session has concluded without a hitch. There was a
solitary item on the agenda, it may be said, namely, adoption of
spinning as an essential duty of every Indian. if this has been
resolved in all sincerity, this session of the Congress may come to
be historic. But historians might condemn it if we have taken this
step without an honest intention of fulfilling it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.39cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have no reason to believe that we might have agreed to the step
without honest faith or with mental reservations. The resolution,
which has now been adopted, itself speaks of two groups—the
“willing” and the “unwilling”. The latter accept the
necessity of spinning as such, though not on their own part. This
group, too, have agreed to send 24, 000 yards of yarn a year, but it
is now the duty of the willing to persuade the unwilling. If those
who are willing go on spinning regularly, the unwilling will also
realize the duty of spinning themselves.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Let us hope there is no unwilling group in Gujarat. Let us not bother
about the small number of the willing. Let us only mind our own work.
If one wishes to become a member of the Congress without spinning
oneself, one has every right to do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
But in Gujarat we have not come across any persons who are reluctant
to spin themselves. Initially the number of spinners may be small.
But if we have active workers, I am convinced that with their help we
shall be able to achieve much.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
Gujarat can if it so desires give a lead in this matter. Gujarat has
all the resources. Only the people must have the will. And it is the
task of the workers to create that will. This will test our capacity
to</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Spread of spinning is spread of khadi and khadi propagation means
complete boycott of foreign-cloth. Thus we should put  in  much more
effort for the propagation of khadi than we have done so far. And the
spread of khadi means the spread of Gujarat khadi. Having produced
its own cloth if Gujarat itself does not consume the same, it will
never witness the miracle of khadi. All the other crafts will follow
in the wake of khadi and Gujarat’s economy will get a fillip.</p>

Gujarat may not suffer from scarcity but it lacks vigour. Gujarat’s
children do not get milk. In case of a famine the people of Gujarat
go begging. This seldom happens anywhere except in India. It is only
when Gujarat completely boycotts foreign-cloth that we shall be saved
from this plight.</p>

It is quite true that all should ply the charkha. Like the cycle of

	The selection of the Working Committee was ultimately left by the
	A.I.C.C. to Deshbandhu Das, Pandit Motilal Nehru and me. I have been
	charged with having yielded everything to the Swarajists. If I have
	done so, I pride myself on the fact. Full surrender must be full.
	The fact however is that no pressure whatsoever was put upon me to
	withdraw a single No-changer’s name. I deliberately withdrew C.
	Rajagopalachari’s, Vallabhbhai’s and Shankerlal Banker’s
	names. It was a matter of honour to have Sarojini Devi and Sardar
	Mangal Singh on the Committee. Mr. Kelkar was anxious to retire in
	favour of Mr. Aney. I would not listen to it. And I was anxious to
	have Mr. Aney as soon as his name was mentioned. Let the reader rest
	assured that the whole selection was made in a spirit of perfect
	comradeship. Assume honesty (and it must be assumed) on the part of
	both the groups and the task of either is difficult enough. Although
	the degree of faith and therefore the emphasis is different, both
	have to strive to find a common method of working the common
	programme. In a Working Committee with a decided majority of
	No-changers strong resolutions can no doubt be carried for khaddar
	work but they cannot carry much weight with those who have only
	reluctantly accepted the khaddar franchise. Whereas resolutions of a
	working Committee in which the predominant voice is that of the
	Swarajists, though they may be mild are sure to carry far greater
	weight with the Swarajists. And my business is to carry the latter
	with me whole-heartely. I want to act upon them and I want them to
	act upon me. Nothing, therefore, can be better than that the
	Swarajist leaders and among them the ablest and most uncompromising
	opponents of the spinning franchise and I should be thrown together
	in an atmosphere in which we must pull together. I do not need that
	kind of contact with the enthusiasts. They are expected to work away
	with all the strength that conviction must</p>

give them. They do not need resolutions or instructions as spur to
action. If, therefore, we mean in the course of the year to achieve
an unbreakable unity between the two wings, the selection of the
Working Committee is, I hold, ideal. Anyway, it must produce an
atmosphere the most favourable for the purpose.</p>

I shall leave no stone unturned to achieve the end. Hence I propose
during the year to carry no motion or proposal that might be of a
party character. Neither the spinning-wheel nor the boycott of
foreign-cloth can be expeditiously worked in the teeth of opposition
from within the Congress ranks indeed we must strive to gain the
support of non-Congressmen for the national constructive progra- mme.
They may not like spinning or wearing khaddar as part of the
franchise, but I have not met many Liberals who have any objection to
hand-spinning as a cottage industry or to the use of khaddar as such
and apart from the franchise. It may be constitutionally impos- sible
for all parties to accept the existing Congress creed or the new
franchise, and therefore to become Congressmen. But I hope that the
existence of the creed or the new franchise will not be a bar against
joint work wherever it is possible.</p>

I had a hard time of it meeting all and sundry and trying to give
them satisfaction. The Namdhari Sikhs brought me  a  bundle  of
papers and expected me to attend to their grievance against the
Akalis. Their patience and courtesy disarmed all unwillingness on my
part. But my inability to attend to their cause was much greater than
my unwillingness. Time would not wait even for their courtesy. They
were themselves able to see that I was perfectly helpless. The only
comfort  I was able to give them was that when I next visited Lahore,
I would certainly go through their papers and see to it that the
Congress did them no injustice. I told them that although I was
partial to the cause of the brave Akalis, I would be no party to any
injustice or oppression being committed by them. Sardar Mangal Singh
re-echoed my sentiment and said that he was always ready to show that
the Akalis wanted nothing but reform of the gurdwaras on a strictly
moral basis.</p>

Mr. Pereira of. Ceylon wanted me to interest the Congress in the
Buddha Gaya Temple. The reader will remember that a movement has been
in progress for some years for the restoration to Buddhists of the
great and historic temple at Buddha Gaya. But it seems to have made
no tangible headway. At the Cocanada Congress Babu Rajendra Prasad
was appointed to inquire into the matter and report. He had not been
able to do so up to the time of the meeting. A Buddhist deput- ation
came from Ceylon to Belgaum during the Congress week to plead the
Buddhist cause personally before the Congress. Mr. Pereira had seen
several leaders and then saw me. He really did not need to plead his
cause before me. I was already a convert. But here again what was I
to do? I had no time for anything else beyond what I had already
undertaken. But Mr. Pereira was irresistible. I told him that I
believed in his cause as much as he did, but the Congress might not
be able to help him much. He was persistent and took away from me the
promise that I should at least let him address the Subjects Committee
and let him take the chance of being rejected. Mr. Pereira had
confidence in himself. His pleasing manners and his  brief  but
eloquent speech made an impression upon  the Committee which decided
to consider the question there and then. But alas! Upon discussion
the Committee discovered that it could not materially assist Mr.
Pereira; it had not the report of its own deputy; it had 
exhaustively discussed the subject at the previous session and owing
to sharp differences was obliged to drop it. The only thing,
therefore, the Committee was able to do was to ask Rajendra Babu to
hasten his inquiry and let the Working Committee have his report on
or before the end of the present month. There is no doubt that the
possession of the temple should vest in the Buddhists. There may be 
legal difficulties. They must be overcome. If the report is true that
animal sacrifice is offered in the temple, it is a sacrilege. It is
equally a sacrilege if the worship is offered, as it is alleged, in a
way calculated to wound the susceptibilities of Buddhists. We should
take pride in helping the restoration of the temple to the rightful
trustees. I hope Rajendra Babu will secure all the literature on the
subject and produce a report which can serve as a guide for all who
wish to advance the cause of the Buddhist claimants. Let me hope also
that Mr. Pereira has remained in India and is assisting Rajendra
Babu.</p>

The national teachers met in informal conference and came to definite
conclusions. The debate was interesting. It centred round the
charkha. Learned pandits attended the conference. I hope that the
teachers will carry out to the letter and in the spirit the
resolutions addressed to themselves. It has been the bane of the
national life to pass resolutions and never to enforce them. The
teachers should be the last persons in the world to make vain
promises. They have in their hands the moulding of the youth of the
country. Let them know that the students are sure to copy their bad
example of breach of their own word in preference to their lofty
sermons on the sacredness of resolutions and promises. This year is a
year of trial and test for the nation. The Congress has staked its
all practically on a single issue, i.e., the production and sale of
khaddar and the boycott of foreign- cloth. The national schools to be
national have to assist this national work by the teachers and boys
and girls learning the various processes incidental to the production
of khaddar, by wearing it themselves and by spinning as much yarn as
they can. Their other studies need not be neglected but they dare not
omit the things that are required for the vital needs of the nation.
The teachers have by an overwhelming majority accepted the position.
I hope they will make it good by acting up to their promise.</p>

The students too met in conference. These were not merely of the
national schools and colleges but they were principally from
Government schools. Mr. Reddy, the President, had a scheme for
utilizing the vacation and other leisure hours of students. His
scheme was to commit the students (he would include the <i>vakils
</i>also) to giving the nation at least 28 evenings every year, each
volunteer to take up four villages in his neighbourhood as his field
of work. Mr. Reddy proposed a course of lectures on a variety of
subjects. For the time being I would occupy the leisure hours of
these volunteers for the spread of khaddar. But this service is not
the only way the students and practising <i>vakils </i>can help.
Surely the least they can do is to use khaddar themselves and spin
half an hour per day. The <i>vakils </i>and students over 21 years
should become members of the Congress and those who are under age
should send their yarn as donation either to their own committee or
to the A.I.K.B.</p>

I hope that provincial Congress committees will lose no time in
organizing the new franchise. I know that some Congressmen are
waiting for instructions from the Working Committee as to the method
of work before commencing enrolment. Such waiting is, however, wholly
unnecessary. It is not the Working Committee that has to organize the
work under the new franchise. The burden rests with every province,
and the sooner they commence the better it is for the purpose for
which the new franchise has been introduced. Congres- smen should
remember that at the end of February the existing list of members
falls into desuetude. If provincial committees wait till then for
enrolment, they will find that they have not even a quorum to go on
with. Membership should, therefore, be actively canvassed from now. I
had hoped to publish some valuable information supplied to me by Sjt.
Satish Chandra Das Gupta as to the method of organiz- ation. I have
also before me two illuminating volumes on khaddar work written by
Satish Babu and published by Khadi Pratisthan. The first volume deals
with the manner of organizing spinning  and weaving and the second
volume collects all the available information about cotton. The
volumes are seasonable. I hope to condense some of the information
made available to the public by their industrious author. Those who
can afford to buy the volumes should possess them. They should write
to the Khadi Pratisthan, 15, College Square, Calcutta, for them. The
price of the first volume is two rupees and that of the second is one
rupee.</p>

are bound, to be entitled to a living membership, to send not less
than 2,000 yards per month. They may send more if they choose. They

committees as donations. They cannot claim membership. There are
however many such who, I am told, would send their yarn only to me.

The evil, as the writer rightly judges, is more or less common to all
the provinces. The remedy is clear. No Government can find employment
for the increasing number of students year after year. The only way
to solve the puzzle is to revise the common idea about education,
that it is a means of finding a career in life. Education should be
taken for our mental and moral development. Secondly, the army of
unemployed young men should realize the dignity of labour and qualify
themselves for taking up the organisation of the charkha industry. It
can take in an unlimited number of young men if they were willing to
take the necessary training and to go to the villages and to be
satisfied with a modest income.</p>

give over cooking to moustached men. Some Brahamins and others plead
their superior caste. I do agree that the caste system stands for
division of functions. But function means the primary or chief
function, whereas all the other functions can as well be common to
all, in fact they ought to be so today. Shri Satish Chandra Das Gupta
has evolved a Shastra for the wheel. I have a charming letter from a
revenue officer at Palitana, which says: “I spin regularly but
neither the Dewan nor the Thakore Sahib<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>objects
to this. The more I spin, the more strength I acquire. Indeed I may
carry a small wheel even while riding.” Is it any wonder if such
officers become popular among the subjects? How else would the people
be crazy about you? When for the first time King George was posted to
a man-of-war as a trainee, he used to partake of the same black
coffee, black bread and cheese as the other sailors. There were no
special arrangements for his board and lodging. He was also given the
same outfit as the ratings. When you know this you will understand
why the British people are crazy about King George. The prince and
the people, the leader and the masses can be bound together by the
thread from the wheel. I had been to Moti Marad. Though the village
is quite far from a railway station I found that <i>malmal </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

The Presidentship of the Kathiawar Political Conference had been
offered to me before I went to jail but I had then refused to
shoulder the responsibility attaching to that honourable position. As
the reasons which then prompted my refusal do not exist any longer, I
have accepted the honour now, though not without trepidation—
trepidation because there is a wide divergence between my own views
and the views held by many on political questions. Again the fact
that  I am President of the National Congress for the current year
makes things rather awkward for me. That single burden is more than I
can fairly discharge, and it would be almost too much for me during
the year to undertake to guide the activities of this Conference in
addition. If therefore presiding over your deliberations today
implies any such responsibility, I may say that I am not at all in a
position to do it justice. Moreover, it would be unfair if the views
which I express as President here are imputed to the Congress  simply
 because  1 happen to lead it also.</p>

It is necessary, therefore, for me to make it clear at the outset

I have often declared that the Congress should generally adopt a
policy of non-interference with regard to questions affecting Indian
States. At a time when the people of British India are fighting for
their own freedom, for them to interfere with the affairs of the
Indian States would only be to betray impotence. Just as  the 
Congress  clearly cannot have any effective voice in the relations
between Indian States and the British Government, even so will its
interference be ineffective as to the relations between the Indian
States and their subjects.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Still the people in British India as well as in the Indian States are
one, for India is one. There is no difference, for example, between
the needs and the manners and customs of Indians in Baroda and of
Indians in Ahmedabad. The people of Bhavnagar are closely related
with the people of Rajkot. Still, thanks to artificial conditions,
the policy of Rajkot may be different from that of Bhavnagar. The
existence of different policies in connection with one and the same
people is a state of things which cannot last for any length of time.
Consequently, even without any interference by the Congress, the
unseen pressure of circumstances alone must lead to the unification
of policies in spite of a multitude of separate jurisdictions. Our
ability to reach unity in diversity will be the beauty and the test
of our civiliz- ation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But I am firmly of opinion that so long as British India is not free,
so long as the people of British India have not attained real power,
that is to say, so long as British India has not the power of
self-expression, in a word, so long as British India does not obtain
swaraj, so long will India, British as well as Native, remain in a
distracted condition. The existence of a third power depends upon a
continuance of such distraction. We can put our house in order only
when British India has attained swaraj.</p>

When swaraj is attained, what will things be like? There will be a
relation of mutual aid and co-operation and destructive conflict will
be a thing of the past. British India under swaraj will not wish for
the destruction of the Indian States, but will be helpful to them.
And the Indian States will adopt a corresponding attitude towards
British  India.</p>

The present condition of Indian States is in my opinion somewhat
pitiable. For the Princes have no independence. Real power</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
does not consist in the ability to inflict capital punishment upon
the subjects, but in the will and the ability to protect the subjects
against the world. Today Indian States do not have this ability, and
consequently by disuse the will also is as good as gone. On the other
hand their power to oppress the subjects appears to have increased.
As there is anarchy in the Empire, there is anarchy in the States
subordinate to the Empire. The anarchy in the States is not so much
due to the Princes and the Chiefs as it is very largely to the
present condition of India.</p>

The present condition of India being opposed to the laws of Nature,

Who then must take the first step? It is obvious that British India
must lead the way. The people there have a consciousness of their
horrible condition and a desire to be free from it, and as knowledge
follows in the wake of desire, so those people only who wish to be
rid of their peril will find out and apply the means of deliverance.
I have therefore often said that the liberation of British India
spells the liberation of the States as well. When the auspicious day
of  the freedom of British India arrives, the relation of ruler and
ruled in the Indian States will not cease but will be purified.
Swaraj as conceived by me does not mean the end of kingship. Nor does
it mean the end of capital. Accumulated capital means ruling power. I
am for the establishment of right relations between capital and
labour, etc. I do not wish for the supremacy of the one over the
other. I do not think there is any natural antagonism between them.
The rich and the poor will always be with us. But their mutual
relations will be subject to Constant change. France is a republic,
but there are all classes of men in France.</p>

Let us not be deluded by catchwords. Every single corruption which we
notice in India is equally present in the so-called highly civilized
nations of the West if under a variety of names. It is distance that
lends enchantment to the view; hence things Western become invested
with a sort of glamour in our eyes. In fact there are perpetual
differences even in the West between the rulers and the ruled. There,
too, people seek for happiness and suffer misery in return.</p>

Many Kathiawaris complain to me against the Princes  and Chiefs of
this beautiful country and take me to task for what they imagine to
be my indifference. These impatient friends will perhaps not
understand me when I say that I have not been indifferent, but have
been seeking for and applying the remedies for the present disorders.
I have staked my all in the movement for swaraj in the hope that
swaraj is a certain cure for all our maladies. As darkness vanishes

The administration of Indian States is the subject of constant
criticism from which this small province has not been free. There is
one common complaint about the Princes and Chiefs. Their fondness for
visits to Europe increases day by day. One can understand their going
to Europe on business or for the acquisition of knowledge. But  a
visit to Europe in the search of mere pleasure would seem to be
intolerable. When a Prince passes most of his time outside his State,
there is chaos in his State. We have seen that in this age of
democracy and dissemination of knowledge, no State or organization
which is not popular or beneficial to the people can continue to
exist. Indian States are not immune from the operation of this law.
Their administration will always be compared with that of the British
now, and of the swaraj government when swaraj has been established.
King George cannot leave England without the consent of his
ministers. And yet his responsibilities are not so great as those of
Indian Princes. Indian Princes retain all power in their own hands.
They make the appointments even to minor posts. Their permission is
needed even for the construction of a bridge. In these circumstances
their visits to Europe are very distasteful to their subjects.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
The expenditure incurred on these visits is also intolerable. If the
institution of kingship has a moral basis, Princes are not inde-
pendent proprietors but only trustees of their subjects for revenue
received from them. It can therefore be spent by them only as trust
money. It may be said that this principle has been almost completely
carried out in the English Constitution. In my humble opinion the
lavish expenditure incurred by our Princes in Europe is absolutely
indefensible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Sometimes this expenditure in Europe is sought to be justified on the
plea that Princes go there for the benefit of their health. This plea
is perfectly ludicrous. No one need, in the search of health, leave 
a country where Himalaya, the king of mountain, exercises undis-
turbed sway, and which is watered by such mighty rivers as the 
Ganges, the Indus, and the Brahmaputra. A country where millions of
men enjoy perfect health should be enough to supply the Princes,
needs on that score.</p>

But perhaps the worst disadvantage of these excursions is the shallow
imitation of the West by the Princes. We have much to learn and
receive from the West, but there is also much in it which must be
rejected. There is no reason to suppose that what suits the climate
of Europe will equally suit all climates. Experience teaches us that
different things suit different climates. The manners and customs of
the West could be but ill-digested by the East, and <i>vice versa.
</i>Among Western nations men and women dance together, it is said,
with restraint and, as report goes, do not overstep the bounds of
decency although they indulge in spirituous liquors during the
intervals of their dances. I need scarcely say what would be the
consequences if we were to imitate this custom. How shameful to us is
the case of an Indian Prince which is being discussed in the
newspapers just now in all its hideous detail?</p>

Another complaint is made in connection with the unchecked
expenditure of Princes and Chiefs. Much of this is difficult to
defend. Princes may have the right to spend money on luxuries and
pleasure within limit. But I take it that even they do not wish for

The revenue system in the States is also not free from blame.  I am
confident that their imitation of the British system has done a great
injury to their subjects. The British revenue system may have a
shadows of justification if we grant that it is morally right  for  a
handful of Englishmen to maintain their hold over our country in any
and every circumstance. There can be no such plea of compelling
necessity in the case of the Indian Princes. They have nothing to
fear</p>

from their subjects as their existence is never in danger. They do
not need a large military force; no Prince has got this and the
British would never permit it. Still they levy a taxation far beyond
the capacity of the subjects to pay. I am pained to  observe  that 
our ancient tradition that revenue is intended only for popular
welfare has been receiving but scant respect.</p>

The Princes, imitation of the British <i>Abkari </i>Department in
order to increase their revenue is particularly distressing. It  is 
said  that <i>abkari is </i>an ancient curse in India. I do not
believe it to be so in the sense in which it is put. Princes in
ancient times perhaps derived some revenue from the liquor traffic,
but they never made the people the slaves of drink that they are now.
Even granting that I am wrong that <i>abkari </i>in its present form
has not been in existence from times immemorial, still I do not
subscribe to the superstition that everything is good because it is
ancient. I do not believe either that anything is good because it is
Indian. He who runs may see that opium and such other intoxicants and
narcotics stupefy a man’s soul and reduce him to a level lower than
that of beasts. Trade in them is demonstrably sinful. Indian States
should close all liquor shops and thus set a good example for the
British administrators to follow. I congratulate the Kathiawar States
which have tried to introduce this reform and I trust the day is not
distant when there will be not a single liquor shop in our peninsula.</p>

There are two items in which we can expect full co-operation from the
Indian States. At one time our national economics was this that just
as we produced our own corn and consumed it so did we</p>

produce our own cotton, spin it in our homes and wear the clothes
woven by our weavers from our own yarn. The first part of this
description is still true while the latter part has almost ceased to
hold good. A man generally spends upon his clothing a tenth of what
he spends upon his food; hence instead of distributing ten per cent
of our income among ourselves we now send it to England or to our own
mills. That means that we lose so much labour, and in the bargain
spend money on our clothing and consequently suffer a twofold loss.
The result is that we stint ourselves in the matter of food in order
to be able to spend on clothing, and sink into greater and greater
misery day by day. We are bound to perish if the  twin  industries 
of agriculture and spinning as well as weaving disappear from our
homes or our villages. I will leave it to the members of the
Conference to imagine what would be the consequence if all the
villages under Bhavnagar were to order out the food and clothing from
Bhavnagar. Still it is this unnatural procedure which we have adopted
about our clothing. We either import our clothing from foreign
countries or else get it from our mills. In either case it spells
decay of our rural population.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
Let us not be deluded by the example of the other countries which
import their clothing from outside and still do not suffer
economically. In other countries if people give up spinning and
weaving, they take to some still more remunerative industry instead.
We on the other hand gave up spinning and partly weaving and had
nothing else to occupy the time thus left vacant.</p>

For Kathiawar it is very easy to escape from the economic
catastrophe. Our Princes can encourage the people by personal
example, and induce them to reinstate khadi in their homes and thus
arrest the progress of the ever-deepening poverty of Kathiawar. In my
view the starting of mills and ginning factories in Kathiawar will
not make for the people’s prosperity, but will be in the nature of
a  disaster. It is not a healthy sign that the middle-class people
are compelled to leave the peninsula in search of a livelihood. There
is no harm if a few enterprising men leave Kathiawar in search of
fortune; but it is shameful and disgraceful for the States that their
subjects being reduced to poverty should feel compelled to leave the
country from pure helplessness. Whenever I have returned to Kathiawar
after staying outside for sometime I have found that the people have
been losing instead of gaining in stamina.</p>

Fortunately the arts of hand-spinning and hand-weaving are being
revived day by day and the importance of khadi is being realized.
Will not the Princes and Chiefs help this movement? It will reflect
no small credit on them if they educate the cultivators to stock
cotton sufficient for the requirements of Kathiawar, and spread the
use of khadi by wearing it themselves. All khadi need not be coarse.
The Princes by encouraging hand-spinning and hand-weaving can revive
many arts and crafts connected with weaving. Royal ladies can spin
fine yarn on wheels artistically painted and adorned with silver
bells, get it woven into fine muslin and deck themselves with it. I
have personally seen delicate varieties being woven in Kathiawar.
That art has now nearly died out. Is it not the special duty of
Princes to encourage such arts?</p>

Another extremely important question is that of untouchability. The
suppressed classes perhaps suffer more in Kathiawar than in other
parts of Greater Gujarat. They are harassed even in railways. To
succour the distressed is the special mission of Princes. They are
the natural champions of the weak. Will they not come to the aid of
the suppressed classes? Princes live by the blessings of their
subjects. Will they not enrich their own lives by earning the
distinction of the suppressed? The scriptures proclaim that there is
no distinction  between a Brahmin and a scavenger. Both have souls;
both have five organs of sense. If they wish, the Princes can do much
to ameliorate the condition of these classes and can remove
untouchability by association with them in a religious spirit. Let
them found schools and sink wells for the suppressed and find a
throne in their hearts.</p>

My ideal of Indian States is that of <i>Ramarajya. </i>Rama taking
his cue from a washerman’s remark and in order to satisfy his

very incarnation of Purity<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. Rama did justice even to a dog. By abandoning his
kingdom and living in the forest for the sake of truth Rama gave to
all the kings of the world an object lesson in noble conduct. By his
strict monogamy he showed that a life of perfect self-restraint could
be led by a royal householder. He lent splendour to his throne by his
popular administration and proved that <i>Ramarajya </i>was the acme
of swaraj. Rama did not need the very imperfect modern instrument of
ascertaining public opinion by counting votes. He had captivated the
hearts of the people. He knew public opinion by intuition as it were.
The subjects of Rama were supremely happy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Such <i>Ramarajya </i>is possible even today. The race of Rama is not
extinct. In modern times the first Caliphs may be said to have
established <i>Ramarajya. </i>Abubaker and Hazrat Umar collected
revenue running into crores and yet personally they were as good as
fakirs. They received not a pie from the Public Treasury. They were
ever watchful to see that the people got justice. It was their
principle that one may not play false even with the enemy but must

In my humble opinion I have done my duty by the Princes in saying a
few words about them. A word now to the people: The popular saying,
“As is the king, so are the people”, is only a half truth. That
is to say, it is not more true than its converse, “As are the
people so is the Prince”. Where the subjects are watchful, a Prince
is entirely dependent upon them for his status. Where the subjects
are overtaken by sleepy indifference, there is every possibility that
the Prince will cease to function as a protector and become an
oppressor</p>

instead. Those who are not wide awake have no right to blame their
Prince. The Prince as well as the people are mostly creatures of
circumstances. Enterprising Princes and peoples mould circumstances
for their own benefit. Manliness consists in making circumstances
subservient to ourselves. Those who will not heed themselves perish.
To understand this principle is not to be impatient, not to reproach
Fate, not to blame others. He who understands the doctrine of 
self-help blames himself for failure. It is on this ground that I
object to violence. If we blame others when we should blame ourselves
and wish for or bring about the destruction, that does not remove the
root cause of the disease which on the contrary sinks all the deeper
for the ignorance thereof.</p>

We then see that the people themselves are as responsible as and even
more responsible than the Princes for the defects pointed out by me.
If public opinion is opposed to a particular line of action, it
should be impossible for the Prince to adopt it. Opposition here does
not mean merely inaudible murmur. Public opposition is effective only
where there is strength behind it. What does a son do when he objects
to some action of his father? He requests the father to desist from
the objectionable course, i.e., presents respectful petitions. If the
father does not agree in spite of repeated prayers, he
non-co-operates with him to the extent even of leaving the paternal
roof. This is pure justice. Where father and son are uncivilized,
they quarrel, abuse each other and often even come to blows. An
obedient son is ever modest, ever peaceful and ever loving. It is
only his love which on due occa- sion compels him to non-co-operate.
The father himself understands this loving non-co-operation. He
cannot endure abandonment by or separation from the son, is
distressed at heart and repents. Not that it always happens thus. But
the son’s duty of non-co-operation is clear.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Such non-co-operation is possible between a Prince and his people. In
particular circumstances it may be the people’s duty. Such
circumstances can exist only where the latter are by nature fearless
and are lovers of liberty. They generally appreciate the laws of the
State and obey them voluntarily without the fear of punishment. .
Reasoned and willing obedience to the laws of the State is the first
lesson in non co-operation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The second is that of tolerance. We must tolerate many laws of the
State, even when they are inconvenient. A son may not approve of</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
some orders of the father and yet he obeys them. It is only when they
are unworthy of tolerance and immoral that he disobeys them. The
father will at once understand such respectful disobedience. In the
same way it is only when a people have proved their active loyalty by
obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of
civil disobedience.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The third lesson is that of suffering. He who has not the capacity of
suffering cannot non-co-operate. He who has not learnt to sacrifice
his property and even his family when necessary can never
non-co-operate. It is possible that a Prince enraged by non-co-
operation will inflict all manner of punishments. There lies the test
of love, patience, and strength. He who is not ready to undergo the
fiery ordeal cannot non-co-operate. A whole people cannot be
considered fit or ready for non-co-operation when only an individual
or two have mastered these three lessons. A large number of the
people must be thus prepared before they can non-co-operate. The
result of hasty non-co-operation can only lead to harm. Some
patriotic young men who do not understand the limitations noted by me
grow impatient. Previous preparation is needed for non-co-operation
as it is for all important things. A man cannot become a
non-co-operator by merely wishing to be one. Discipline is
obligatory. I do not know that many have undergone the needful
discipline in any part of Kathiawar. And when the requisite
discipline has been gone through probably non-co-operation will be
found to be unnecessary.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
As it is, I observe the necessity for individuals to prepare them-
selves in Kathiawar as well as in other parts of India. Individuals
must cultivate the spirit of service, renunciation, truth,
non-violence, self-restraint, patience, etc. They must engage in
constructive work in order to develop these qualities. Many reforms
would be effected automatically if we put in a good deal of silent
work among the people.</p>

Kathiawar is famous for its political class. This class affects an
exaggerated politeness and consequently it has developed hypocrisy,
timidity and sycophancy. They are an educated body of men and
therefore, they must become the pioneers in reforms. They can do much
for the people if they wish. We find contentment among the people in
places where these political officials are men of character. Needless
to say that my remarks apply to the politicals as a class. I do</p>

not wish to suggest that they apply to every member of that class. On
the contrary, I know that some of the best of workers are drawn from
this class. Hence I have never lost hope about this class. Much good
might result if only it served the States not for making money but
for pure service.</p>

Again, constructive service is easy for those who not serving the
States have adopted an independent profession. I am anxious to see
them develop the qualities mentioned above. We want silent workers
and pure fighters who would merge themselves among the people.
Workers of this description can be counted on one’s fingers. Is
there even one such worker for every village in Kathiawar? I know the
answer is in the negative. The class of people who will read this
will hardly have any idea of rural life. Those who have some idea of
it will not like it. Still, India and hence Kathiawar lives in the
villages.</p>

How is this service to be rendered? Here I give the first place to
the spinning-wheel. I have heard much against it. But I know the time
is near when the very thing which is being abused today will be
worshipped as <i>sudarshana chakra</i>. I am confident that if we do
not take it up voluntarily, the force of circumstances will compel
us. The study of Indian economics is the study of the spinning-wheel.
It is the <i>sine qua non </i>for the revival of our languishing
village industries. I do not look upon hand-spinning as an occupation
but as a duty  incumbent upon followers of all religious sects and
denominations.</p>

An American writer says that the future lies with nations that
believe in manual labour. Nations are tired of the worship of
lifeless machines multiplied <i>ad </i><i>infinitum. </i>We are
destroying the matchless living machines, viz., our own bodies by
leaving them to rust and trying to substitute lifeless machinery for
them. It is a law of God that the body must be fully worked and
utilized. We dare not ignore it. The spinning-wheel is the auspicious
symbol of <i>sharir </i><i>yajna—</i>body labour. He who eats his
food without offering this sacrifice steals it. By giving up this
sacrifice we became traitors to the country and banged the door in
the face of the Goddess of Fortune. The numerous men and women in
India whose bodies are mere skeletons bear witness to this. My
revered friend Mr. Shastriar says I am interfering even in the
people’s choice of their dress. This is perfectly true. It is</p>

the duty of every servant of the nation to do so whenever it becomes
necessary. I would certainly raise my voice against it, if the nation
takes, say, to the pantaloon. It is wholly unsuited to our climate.
It is the duty of every Indian to raise his voice against the nation
using foreign-cloth. The opposition really is not to the cloth being
foreign but to the poverty which its importation brings in its train.
If the nation gives up its <i>jawar </i>and <i>bajri </i>and imports
oats from Scotland or rye from Russia I would certainly intrude into
the nation’s kitchen, would scold it to the full and even sit
<i>dharana </i>and make the agony of my soul heard. Such intrusions
have even happened within recent times. During the late diabolical
War in Europe  people  were compelled to raise particular crops, and
the States controlled the food and drink of their subjects.</p>

Those who wish to serve in the villages cannot but take up the study
of the spinning-wheel. Hundreds and even thousands of young men and
women can earn their livelihood by its means and doubly repay the
nation for it. This work means organization and familiarity with
every villager to whom one could easily impart a rudimentary
knowledge of economics and politics. The work might also include the
true education of the village children and give one an insight into
the many wants and shortcomings of villages.</p>

Such also is the work among untouchables. It is the bounden duty of
all Hindus to remove untouchability. Here also no inter- ference need
be feared from any Prince. I firmly believe that Hindus would regain
the strength of soul if by serving the suppressed and receiving their
hearts’ blessings they carried on a process of self-purification.
Untouchability is a great blot on Hinduism. It is necessary to remove
that blot. The Hindu who serves the suppressed will be a saviour of
Hinduism and will enshrine himself in the hearts of his suppressed
brothers and sisters.</p>

ment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand
times more effective and permanent than the one derived from fear of

force of such enlightened and forceful public opinion. After all the

think it difficult to make a successful appeal to their sense of
justice. We have never made an earnest effort. We are in a hurry. In

I know that to many my speech will appear incomplete and even
insipid. But I cannot give any practical or useful advice by going
outside my province. My field of labour is clearly defined and it
pleases me. I am fascinated by the law of love. It is the
philosophers’ stone for me. I know ahimsa alone can provide a
remedy for our ills. In my view the path of non-violence is not the
path of the timid or the unmanly. Ahimsa is the height of Kshatriyas
dharma as it represents the climax of fearlessness. In it there is no
scope for flight or for defeat. Being a quality of the soul it is not
difficult of attainment. It comes easily to a person who feels the
presence of the soul within. I believe that no other path but that of
non-violence will suit India. The symbol of that dharma for India is
the spinning-wheel as it alone is the friend of the distressed and
the giver of plenty for the poor. The law of love knows no bounds of
space or time. My swaraj, therefore,</p>

ideal constitution for the States as you alone can be its fashioners.
My duty lies in discovering and employing means by which the nation
may evolve the strength to enforce its will. When once the nation is
conscious of its strength, it will find its own way or make it. That
Prince is acceptable to me who becomes a Prince among his people’s
servants. The subjects are the real masters. But what is the servant
to do if the master goes to sleep? Everything, therefore, is included
in trying for a true national awakening.</p>

Such being my ideal there is room for Indian States in swaraj as
conceived by me and there is full protection guaranteed  to  the
subjects for their rights. The true source of rights is duty. I have
thorefore spoken only about the duties of Princes as well as  the

This is a political conference; hence you would expect a discussion
of political matters only. But my thoughts and feelings are those of
a rustic, a peasant, a common man. Although I was born in a trading
community—the Bania class—and my father and grandfather were
connected with matters of State as well, I am no statesman; there is
no trace of statesmanship or diplomacy in me; and if there is any, it
is in spite of me. But I have another quality in me, which is not
inherited but is entirely self-acquired, and that is the quality of
being a peasant, a scavenger, a <i>Dhed, </i>the lowliest of the low.
I cannot, therefore, define “politics” in your terms—as
statesmanship. Being what I am, I cannot think of matters only
concerning the State when taking up a “political” Subject, for a
farmer cannot look after his fields by making speeches—he can only
do so by taking up  his  plough and not giving it up under the
hottest sun. Similarly, a weaver can ply his trade by hard work
alone. The common meaning of the word “political” is, however,
making speeches, organizing agitations or movements and finding fault
with the Government. But to me, the meaning of this word is quite
different. Even during the twenty-two years of my stay abroad, I had
given it a different definition. Yet, as things look enchanting from
a distance, people have been mistaking me for a statesman or a
politician. No doubt, I like politics too, but it is of a different
kind. There is no place for scheming in it; it is full of love and
understanding. In fact, love and affection are a thousand times more
effective than political manoeuvring besides, the interests of
everybody including those of the peasant, the scavenger and the
pariah, can best be looked after through understanding and love. You
know, I gave a similar definition of statesmanship before the
Congress and I was not ashamed of it. It is from this point of view
that I have included khadi among political matters. I claim my view
to be wise and enlightened, and hope that some day you will also hail
my advocacy of the spinning-wheel and khadi as shrewd, wise and
enlightened. When people mock at me today and describe the
spinning-wheel as Gandhi’s toy, I pity them, and I am not going to
give it up however much they laugh at me.</p>

Now, to the next important subject. Ever since I was invited here and
I wrote in <i>Navajivan </i>that, if a separate enclosure was
arranged for seating the untouchables in this conference, then my
place would be among them,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>a
big outcry has been raised in Bhavnagar. I have seen with my own eyes
how bad is the evil of untouchability in Kathiawar. My own revered
mother thought it a sin to touch a <i>Bhangi. </i>She is no less dear
to me on that account. But I don’t want to follow in the footsteps
of my parents in this matter.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>I
have inherited from them the spirit of freedom, and I am convinced
that, even if I think differently from them on this subject, the soul
of my mother will bless me all the same and will approve of my stand,
for in none of the solemn vows she made me take was touching someone
mentioned as a sin. Before I went to England, she took three promises
from me, but she never asked me to adhere to untouchability as
religious duty. I can quite see the little— or I should say
perhaps, big—commotion in Bhavnagar; and the <i>Nagars, </i>the
<i>Vanias </i>and others are upset. To such people who are present
here and who really believe that Gandhi is out to uproot the  
<i>sanatan</i><i>a  </i><i> </i>dharma<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,   I   would   like   to   say    deliberately    and
emphatically that Gandhi has no such intention whatsoever; on the
contrary, <i>sanatana </i>dharma is rooted in what Gandhi says. Some
of you may be learned men who have learnt every word of the Vedas by
heart; I would nevertheless like to point out their mistake and say
that the very foundations of <i>sanatana </i>dharma are being shaken
by people who consider untouchability to be the heart of Hindu
religion. With due respect I would submit that such belief lacks
foresight, wisdom, discrimination, humility or compassion. Even if I
remain alone in my conviction; I must still proclaim to the very end
that if we  accommodate the present conception of unthouchability in
Hindu religion, it will surely lead to decay and bring about eventual
death. To Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras I would say that
the emancipation of India does not rest so much on the Muslims and
the Christians as on how the Hindus themselves uphold their religion;
for the  Kashivishvanath<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4

Ramachandra. Ascetics and sages have lived and practised austere
penance here. They have called our country a field of duty and not a
garden of pleasure. I tell the people of this land that Hindu
religion is on test today, and it is being weighed against all the
other religions of the world. If anything inconsistent with
compassion,  morality or reason is allowed to stay in the Hindu
religion, then it will surely perish. I am fully aware of the virtue
of compassion, and am therefore able to see what hypocrisy and
ignorance is being practised under the cover of Hindu religion. This
hypocrisy and ignorance I shall fight, alone if necessary. I shall do
penance and may die in this struggle. But if perchance I lose my
reason and in my insanity admit  my present views on untouchability
as wrong and say that I have sinned in describing untouchability as a

There is no selfish motive in whatever I am saying today. I do not
seek any position or prestige thereby. If at all I seek any position
it is that of a <i>Bhangi</i>. Cleansing of dirt is sacred work which
can be done by a Brahmin as well as a <i>Bhangi</i>, the former doing
it with and the latter without the knowledge of its holiness. I

not asking you to inter-dine with or inter-marry him. How can I

the world, a sannyasi who is not bound by social customs, though how
much of a true fakir or sannyasi I am, I cannot say. But I do like
renouncing the world and its ways. I also like <i>brahmacharya</i>,
though how much of a true <i>brahmachari </i>I am, I cannot also say,

be called a <i>brahmachari. </i>If I utter one word of anger, do
anything out of malice or jealousy, say anything in fury even to
someone who considers himself my deadliest enemy, I cannot call
myself a <i>brahmachari. </i>Therefore I do not know whether I am a
true sannyasi or <i>brahmachari; </i>but I can assert that my life
and my thoughts tend towards that state. With this ingrained trait in
my character, I cannot refuse to serve a <i>Bhangi </i>girl or a

God may protect me or kill me, but serve a leper I must. I may even
say that, while engaged in such service, I would be entirely
unconcerned whether or not God protected me. I regard it my sacred
duty to eat only after making the pariah or the leper eat. But I am
not asking you to violate any social barriers as regards eating and 
drinking. I expect only one thing from you, namely, that you should
not create a fifth caste. God has cast men in a fourfold structure of
society. I can understand that; but please do not create a fifth
caste of untouchables. I cannot tolerate untouchability and am much
pained to hear that word. I would request those who oppose me to
think  carefully, to come to me and understand through discussion
what I am talking about. If you talk recklessly and thoughtlessly;
you are not going to convince anyone thereby. I have received today a
telegram signed by two pandits. I do not know these gentlemen; they
write to say that the accusations heaped on me in the name of
Hinduism and in the name of the Pandits are baseless, that they are
going to send me such messages signed by the learned men of their
class that shall prove that many shastris support me. They also plead
their inability to work as vigorously as I do in this field, for they
say that I am fearless whereas they have to weigh many
considerations. When Shri Krishna went to Dronacharya and
Bhishmacharya and asked them if they were going to fight the
Pandavas, the two elders expressed their helplessness since, they
said, they had to think of their livelihood. We have many such
Dronacharyas and Bhishmacharyas among us who, poor people, have to
think of their stomachs first. They are in no position to do
anything. The fault lies with Providence or their circumstances. Even
so, they bless me in their heart of hearts and know that whatever
Gandhi says is true. But here I must also add one more thing. I am a
satyagrahi; my creed ordains me not to kill anyone but to lay down my
own life. I shall have to go my own way. I have, therefore, a request
to make to you. If you sincerely believe that untouchability is the
very core of Hinduism, then stick to it; but give me also my right to
my belief that it is a disgrace to Hinduism. You may, if you can,
rouse the Hindu world in your favour; but give me also an equal
opportunity to do likewise. For a Satyagrahi there is only one path
to follow: he does not seek alliances or compromises with others. I
shall therefore assure you that in my dealings with you, I shall
always be guided by love. If I am left alone, I shall segregate
myself and ask people to keep away from me.</p>

To those who are assisting me in my work of removing untouchability,
and to the so-called untouchables, I would counsel forbearance even
against abuse. Tulsidas has said that compassion is the very source
of religion. If you forsake love, you shall lose the battle. They who
regard untouchability as sin, must not sin themselves by hating their
opponents. Turn a smiling face even  to  those whoabuse you. If you
love them from the depth of your heart, and maintain the right
attitude and behaviour, the sin of untouchability is bound to be
eradicated.</p>

I fail, however, to understand this opposition in Kathiawar.
Kathiawar is the land of Sudama, of Shri Krishna and Aniruddha. Where
should I go if untouchability finds a place in the land where
warriors have shed their blood? However, the <i>Bhangis </i>tell me
that the conditions here are worse than in any other part of Gujarat.

Who is Narandas Sanghani but a son to me? Once he used to follow me
blindly and delighted in serving me. He gave all his library to me.
But God has now induced ill-will in him. However, he is still like a
son to me. I believe that his mischief will not last long and that
his rows will never be fulfilled. Even if God wishes it otherwise,
and Sanghani raises his hand to attack me, I shall ask him to please
himself and bless him. Prahlad disobeyed his father since, he said,
the father was leading him towards the path of sin and he was not
bound by the father’s orders. If Narandas still believes that he is
like the eldest son to me and yet he wishes to do away with me
because I have gone astray, he should certainly strike me. I am sure
his eyes will open when he has done so, and he will then come to you
with downcast head to atone for his sin. He is just a child, he is
young, whereas I have grown old. Many people have raised their hand
against me, but I have survived. Once I had appendicitis and I was
operated upon. During the operation the lamp went off and Col.
Maddock was greatly distressed. But God wanted to save me and here I
am with no harm done ! There is a story in the Upanishads that Vayu<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

failure. So, if God does not wish me to die, who can kill me? And if

overflowing love. It is no wonder when I know that everywhere in
India I find Kathiawar, i.e., the overwhelming love  of Kathiawar.
Much as I prize that love, I crave for that “love amazing, love
divine”, which nourishes the soul, and not the love which, not
being backed by the will to perform promises made, withers the soul.
It is service of the people that connects you and me, and not
circumstances of a private nature. Unless, therefore, you give all
your love practical shape, turn it into work of public benefit, it
has, for me at least, no meaning. I am an ordinary mortal, as much
exposed to affections and passions  as  anyone of you. But I always
try to control them. I therefore demand love which soothes but does
not overwhelm. I want the fire of that love to purify and not to burn
me. Let all your love therefore be converted</p>

I am grateful to you for allowing me to exercise the fullest
discretion as regards the resolutions you had drafted for
consideration before the Subjects Committee. Your draft contained a
long list of grievances. I asked you to restrain the desire for
passing resolutions regarding grievances and to cultivate
self-discipline and the capacity of suffering. You accepted my
advice, not out of regard for my personality, but because you know
that I am a practical man and havesome experience of public affairs.
In advising you however to drop most of your resolutions, I did not
mean to muzzle myself too on the matters referred to therein. I have
taken up greater  responsibility on my shoulders. I do not want to go
to sleep, because you have waived all discussion of your grievances.
It shall be, for me, a year of intense, unremitting toil.</p>

But I shall work on my condition. The advice I have given you is
based on trust, trust in human nature, trust in the Kathiawar Chiefs.
Even  so  at  Amritsar  I  pleaded<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>with
 my  brother-delegates   not   to distrust Mr. Montagu, not to
distrust Lord Sinha’s judgment, not to distrust His Majesty the
King, and you know that  the  Congress accepted my advice to a
considerable extent. You must remember that against me was ranged
that day no less an opponent than the late Lokamanya Tilak. But he
and the others saw that I was suggesting the proper thing and
accepted my suggestion. I pleaded with them somewhat in this wise:
“Accept the Reforms today, as given in good faith. The moment you
feel that they are more a burden than a blessing, you may reject
them. For Mr. Montagu says that he has tried to secure all that he
could for us. Lord Sinha, a man in the know and a distinguished
patriot, has also advised the country to accept the Reforms”. The
King’s message too was couched in graceful language. All those
considerations led me to suggest acceptance of the Reforms. Out of
that state of trust, when it was proved to be misplaced, arose
non-co-operation. Today too I am asking you to adopt a policy of
trust. But pray do not press the parallel too far. It is meant only
to assure you that I do not want to sit silent. I have heard more
tales of woe than you have told me. I do not know how much of all I
have heard is true. But you may be sure that as soon as I am
convinced that the complaints are true,  I   shall  use   whatever 
ability  and  resource-</p>

fulness I possess to get them remedied. I shall try to see the
Princes concerned. If I succeed in getting a hearing from them, I
shall discuss all your grievances with them, and shall, if permitted,
acquaint the public with the result. Mussalman friends from Dhoraji
had a series of grievances against the Thakore Sahib of Gondal. They
asked to be permitted to place them before the Conference. But I
dissuaded them, as I was not in possession of the facts. I have the
honour to know the Thakore Sahib of Gondal. I have had the pleasure
of meeting him. I regard him with respect, and I know that he is a
capable ruler. It is therefore unbearable that he should mean or do
any harm to his subjects. How can I indict him at the instance of
half a dozen or more people? So long as I have not seen him or not
spoken to the subordinate officers concerned, it would not be
possible for me to give any definite lead. It would be against my
nature to do so. I therefore assured the friends from Dhoraji that I
would inquire into all their charges, and then do the needful. It was
an awkward situation, my having to advise the Mussalman friends who
might not trust me and know that I make no distinction between a
Hindu and a Mussalman. But Maulana Shaukat Ali’s arrival has
fortified me. I told them that the Maulana and I would both consider
over the matter, and give them our joint advice. I am glad to say
that they agreed to this.</p>

Jamnagar is in the same position as Gondal. I have numerous
complaints against the ruler of that State also. If a subject may
claim friendship with a ruling Prince, I may say that Jamsahib and I
were friends in our youth. The late Kevalram Mavji Dave gave me a
note of introduction to Jamsahib when I went to England. Very often
we used to meet each other there, and the wish was dearest to the
hearts of every one of us, his friends, that he should succeed to the
gadi of Jamnagar. But today I hear numerous charges against him, none
of which I wish may be true. I also wish that Jamsahib should of his
own accord remedy all the wrongs (if any) that may have been
committed against his subjects by him or in his name. It is not my
purpose to embarrass him. I should approach him in all humility and
plead with him. I should do the same with my bitterest opponent. Sir
Michael O’Dwyer, for instance, thinks I am the wickedest man on
earth. If he were to return to India as the King’s representative,
I would  not hesitate to approach him, if need be, in all humility.
Why should I do otherwise with Jamsahib? I have a huge pile of
material before me aspersing both him and the Thakore Sahib of
Gondal. But how can I make use of it, how can I criticize them,
without inquiry? But I am not</p>

A word now for your part of the bargain. I ask you not to disturb the
task I have undertaken, by private or public criticism of a bitter or
rancorous nature. I ask you not to irritate the Princes. They are,
after all, rulers and are therefore like all men in authority.
Authority blurs the vision. We cannot have Rama in every age, nor
Umar. None of the Caliphs who came after the glorious thirty years of
the Caliphate could ever approach anyone of the first four Caliphs.
Such rulers are rare even as the gems embedded in the most hidden
recesses of mines. Wherever, therefore, I find a ruler getting
irritated or angry I am patient with him. For anger is natural to
them as much as to you or me if we were similarly placed. Kings are
no more philosophers or saints than anyone of us. The world knows
only one Janaka Videhi. Even under swaraj we shall have to put up
with a fair amount of failings of the swaraj officials. Why only an
hour ago perhaps I gave you a foretaste of how a man in authority
behaves. How can I say that I did not in any instance abuse my
authority? A shastri and a <i>muni </i>asked for permission to speak;
I did not give it, I told the <i>muni </i>: “No more this wordy
warfare for you. Your business is to go about from place to place 
introducing  charkhas  in  every home.” How do I know that I did
not exceed the bounds of propriety in thus disallowing both? But I
was clothed in authority, however brief, and so you put up with me.
Wherever there is the use of authority, there is scope for anger and
injustice and we must need drink many a bitter cup at the hands of
rulers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I have thus presented to you two sides of the case, one for the
rulers and the other for the ruled. It is unbearable for me that a
Kathiawar prince should do wrong to his subjects. To him I say: “For
what earthly use do you behave thus?” To you I say: “You must
learn lessons of forbearance and self-suffering.” I commend to your
attention the last paragraph of my printed Presidential  address.  I
would ask you to read and read that paragraph and to chew and digest
it. No people have risen who thought only of rights. Only those did
so who thought of duties. Out of the performance of duties flow
rights, and those that knew and performed their duties came naturally
by the rights. The Shastras inculcate reverence to parents. It means
implicit obedience to them, and why do we willingly obey like that?
We know</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
that an angry look from his mother was sufficient to make the
giant-like Shaukat Ali cower before her. What is the secret of this
willing obedience? It is that the obedience carries with it enjoyment
of  a right—the right to inheritance. At the back of obedience is a
consciousness of a right to be enjoyed, and yet woe to the man who
obeys with an eye to the right to inheritance. It is the Shastras
again that inculcate obedience without an eye to the fruit thereof.
He who thinks not of the right gets it, and he who thinks of it loses
it. That is the rule of conduct I would like to place before you. If
you follow it I have no doubt that you will create a disciplined army
of workers for swaraj. After you have succeeded in raising such an
army, no ruler dare ignore you. As it is, the gentleman who invited
the next conference to Sorath did so with considerable trepidation,
lest a ruler should refuse permission to hold it. You have therefore
to clear the atmosphere, and to raise your moral stature to such a
degree that no one would want to refuse your  request. I hope you
will not misunderstand me. I am not asking you to do aught that you
should not do, that may be calculated to injure your self-respect.
Always insist on truth, and urge it with humility and grace. I am a
journalist of long standing. In my own way I claim to know my art
well. For I make it a point to write only one thing when there are a
hundred things that I might write. Now if I were to open the columns
of <i>Young </i><i>India </i>and <i>Navajivan </i>to all the
controversial topics and complaints that are referred to me, that
would be the surest way to lose the little reputation I have gained
for these journals. And punctilious though  I  am in the observance
of this rule, I  dare say I  err  on  occasions.   I would therefore
ask such of you as are journalists and publicists to curb your pen
and tongue. Exercise the strictest economy of words, but not of
truth. Restrain your expression, but not the inner light which should
burn brighter with increasing restraint. Nor will you thus fall a
prey to weakness. Flattery and anger are the two sides of weakness,
one the obverse, other the reverse. The reverse—anger—is worse
than the obverse—flattery. Only a weak man either resorts to
flattery or tries to disguise his weakness under anger. Let no one
flatter himself that his anger is an expression of his strength.
Strength lies only in action and action is duty done. Those who have
captivated the hearts of men are souls heroic and true, who have
burnt their passions to cinders in the fire of restraint. For you
also, therefore, who have the salvation of Kathiawar at heart,
patience and restraint should be the watchwords. The king carries on
his work by means of punitive</p>

sanctions. You will carry on your work with the sanction of sacrifice
and love. Drench both the rulers and ruled with the water of your
sacrifice and love, so that you may convert Kathiawar into an Eden
worthy for men and gods to behold. If I may bless you, that is my
blessing. If I am not worthy to give you blessings, that is my prayer
to God. Let the spinning-wheel be a symbol of your sacrifice and love
for fellowmen.</p>

I have to speak today on the dharma or duty of students. That dharma
is as easy as it is difficult. According to Hinduism, the student is
a <i>brahmachari, </i>and <i>brahmacharyashrama </i><i>is </i>the
student-state. Celibacy is a narrow interpretation of <i>brahmacharya.
</i>The original meaning is the life or the state of a student. That
means control of the senses, but the whole period of study or
acquirement of knowledge by means of control of the senses came to be
regarded as <i>brahma- </i><i>charyashrarma. </i>This period of life
necessarily means very  much taking and very little giving. We are
mainly recipients in this state— taking whatever we can get from
parents, teachers and from the world. But the taking, if it
carries—as it did—no obligation of simultaneous repayment, it
necessarily carried an obligation to repay the whole debt, with
compound interest, at the proper time. That is why the Hindus
maintain <i>brahmacharyashrama </i>as a matter of religious duty.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
The [lives] of a <i>brahmachari </i>and a sannyasi are regarded as
spiritually similar. The <i>brahmachari </i>must needs be a sannyasi
if he is to be a <i>brahmachari. </i>For the sannyasi, it is a matter
of choice. The four ashramas of Hinduism have nowadays lost their
sacred character, and exist, if at all, in name. The life of the
student <i>brahmachari </i><i>is</i><i> </i>poisoned at the very
spring. Though there is nothing left of the ashramas today which we
may hold up to the present generation as something to learn from and
copy, we may still hark back to the ideals that inspired the original
ashramas.</p>

How can we understand the duty of students today? We have fallen so
much from the ideal. The parents take the lead in giving the wrong
direction. They feel that their children should be educated only in
order that they may earn wealth and position. Education and knowledge
are thus being prostituted, and we look in vain for the peace,
innocence and bliss that the life of a student ought to be. Our
students are weighed down with cares and worries when they should
really  be  “careful  for  nothing”.  They  have  simply   to  
receive and to assimilate. They should know only to discriminate
between what should be received and what rejected. It is the duty of
the teacher to teach his pupils discrimination. If we go on talking
in indiscrimin- ately, we would be no better. than machines. We are
thinking, knowing beings and we must in this period distinguish truth
from untruth, sweet from bitter language, clean from unclean things
and so on. But the student’s path today is strewn with more
difficulties than the one of distinguishing good from bad things. He
has to fight the hostile atmosphere around him. Instead of the sacred
surroundings of a <i>rishi </i>guru’s ashram and his paternal care,
he has the atmosphere of a broken down home, and the artificial
surroundings created by the modern system of education. The <i>rishis
</i>taught their pupils without books. They only gave them a few
<i>mantras </i>which the pupils treasured in their memories and
translated in practical life. The present day student has to live in
the midst of heaps of books, sufficient to choke him. In my own days
Reynolds was much in vogue among students and I escaped him only
because I was far from being a brilliant student and never cared to
peep out of the school text books. When I went to England, however, I
saw that the novels were tabooed in decent circles and that I had
lost nothing by having never read them.  Similarly there are many
other things which a student might do worse than reject. One such
thing is the craze for earning a career. Only the
<i>grihastha—</i>householder—has to think of it, it is none of
the <i>brahmachari </i>student’s dharma. He has to acquaint himself
with the condition of things in his own country, try to realize the
magnitude of the crisis with which it is faced and the work that it
requires of him. I dare say many amongst you read newspapers. I do
not think I can ask you to eschew them altogether. But I would ask
you to eschew everything of ephemeral interest, and I can tell you
that newspapers afford nothing of permanent interest. They offer
nothing to help the formation of character. And yet I know the craze
for newspapers. It is pitiable, terrible. I am talking in this strain
as I have myself made</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
some experiments in education. Out of those experim-ents I learnt the
meaning of education, I discovered Satyagraha and non-co-operation
and launched on those new experiments. I assure you I have never
regretted having tried these last, nor have I undertaken them simply
with the object of winning political swaraj. I have ventured to place
them even before students. For they are innocent. They are today
summed up in the spinning-wheel. First it was hailed with. ridicule,
then came scorn, and presently it will be received with joy. The
Congress has adopted it, and I would not hesitate to offer  it
respectfully even to Lord Reading. I would not hesitate to do so, as
I know that I would lose nothing in so doing. The loser would be Lord
Reading if he chose to reject it. I did not hesitate to deliver  the 
message of the wheel to the Bishop of Calcutta when I had the honour
to make his acquaintance in Delhi. I did the same with Col. Maddock,
and when Mrs. Maddock sailed for England I presented her with a
khaddar towel as a memento, and asked her to carry the message from
house to house.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I am not tired of preaching the message of the wheel on all occasions
at all hours, because it is such an innocent thing and yet so potent
of good. It may not be relishing, but no health-giving food has the
relish of spicy foods so detrimental to health, And so the <i>Gita </i>in
a memorable text asks all thinking people to take things of which the
first taste is bitter, but which are ultimately conducive to
immortality. Such a thing today is the spinning wheel and its
product. There is no <i>yajna </i>(Sacrifice) greater than spinning,
calculated to bring peace to the troubled spirit, to soothe the
distracted student’s mind,  to spiritualize his life. I have today
no better prescription for the country—not even the <i>Gayatri</i>—in
this practical age which looks for immediate results. <i>Gayatri </i>I
would fain offer, but I cannot promise immediate result, whilst the
thing I offer is such as you can take to, with God’s name on your
lips, and expect immediate result. An English friend wrote saying his
English common sense told him that spinning was an excellent hobby. I
said to him, “It may be a hobby for you, for us it is the Tree of
Plenty.” I do not like many Western ways, but there are certain
things in them for which I cannot disguise my liking. Their “hobby”
is a thing full of meaning. Col. Maddock, who was an efficient
surgeon and took supreme delight in his task, did not devote all his
hours to his work. Two hours he had set apart for his hobby which was
gardening and it was this gardening that lent zest and savour to his
life</p>

I have  pleasure  therefore  in  placing  the  spinning-wheel before
you, even as a hobby if  you  wills  in  order  that  your  life may
have zest and savour, in order that you may find peace and bliss. It
will help you to lead a life of <i>brahmacharya. </i>Faith is a thing
of great moment in the student state. There are so many things which
you have to take for granted. You accept them simply because you get
them from your teacher. Some propositions in geometry, for instance,
were very difficult of comprehension for me. I took them for granted,
and today I not only can understand them, but can lose myself in a
study of geometry as easily as I can do in my present work. If you
have faith and ply the wheel, you take it from me that some day you
will admit that what an old man once told you about it Was literally
true. No wonder that one learned in the lore applied the following
text from the <i>Gita </i>to the spinning-wheel:</p>

It seems that even now the change in voting rights appears terrible
to many. This does not surprise me. We are often troubled by a new
thing; sometimes it produces fear. I hope that, as time goes by, fear
will disappear and people will realize the value of the spinning
franchise. In order to help such appreciation, it is necessary that
those who have faith in the spinning-wheel should prove it by their
persistence in it. Without waiting for orders from the Provincial
Committee, those who are already spinning should do it  more
regularly and those who are not doing should start doing it. As hanks
measuring two thousand yards are ready, people should hand them over
to the Provincial Committees and get their names registered. This
must not wait for a notice from the Provincial Committee.</p>

What is true of spinning applies also to khadi which needs a great
deal of propaganda. In my journey through Dohad and Godhra  I found
that very few people have taken to khadi as yet. Of those who</p>

He who regularly gives truthful answers in his diary will soon find
that his capacity for work grows Constantly. Every individual has
some self-respect and no one likes to record failures for ever.
Hence, an honest person overcomes his failures and achieves victory.
A good businessman keeps a diary and derives invaluable benefit from
it. It is obligatory for the captain of a ship to maintain a
log-book. Why should not the salesmen of swaraj do likewise? If a
despondent people wish to regain hope, the Congress has shown the
royal road to it. If we give up idleness and become industrious, we
shall get results immediately. This is no time for criticism, no time
for doubts. This is the time only to work silently, that is, to spin,
to make others spin, to wear khadi and to make others wear it.</p>

	I congratulate you, students, who have received degrees today and
	hope that you will fulfil the vow that you have taken. Normally, on
	such an occasion, an institution reports progress in the numbers of
	students and teachers and in other respects. You must have seen from
	the report which the registrar read today that during the last four
	years the number of students has gradually been going down.
	Ordinarily this would cause disappointment. I am not disappointed,
	though I would admit that if it had been possible for us to show an
	increase in the number of students or some other progress by 
	commonly accepted standards, I would have been pleased. I cannot say
	that the present position of the institution pleases me, but I am
	also not disappointed. It is true I and many others with me had
	hoped that we would need to run this institution only for a year and
	that after the attainment of swaraj at the close of this period you
	would go back to your schools and colleges which you had left at the
	call of the</p>

country. But four years instead of one have already passed and it is
not yet possible to say how long we must still remain in banishment.
I have now come to believe that even after we secure swaraj, many
such institutions would continue to work independently of the
Government. The only difference then would be that unlike today these
institutions would not have to compete with Government schools and
colleges and the latter would not be regar-dedas belonging to the
opposite camp and therefore fit to be boycotted. But then also such
experiments would certainly continue and there would be a place for
institutions like ours. I hope, therefore, that the students who are
studying here will not give way to disappointment nor think of the
period they have been here as wasted.</p>

This morning itself, when I reached the Ashram,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>there
was a postcard waiting for me. It contained accusations against this
institu- tion. The communication was anonymous. I have very often
comm- ented in <i>Navajivan </i>that no one should write an anonymous
letter. It is shameful, cowardly in a way. We should give up this
tendency. If we do not have the courage to proclaim our ideas to the
world, it is better that we forget them, bury them. However, this
tendency prevailed in this country for many years and, maybe, exists
even now. I did, therefore, read the anonymous communication. It
says: “Why don’t you close this institution? Why don’t you open
your eyes? You have misguided the students. Many students are
returning to Government schools after deserting this institution.
Whatever you  think,  the students have not the least faith in the
charkha. Therefore, you should close the Vidyapith and all affiliated
institutions.” I do not accept this advice, and I wish that you too
should not accept it. No new institution can be judged on the basis
of funds spent on it or the number of men working for it. If we
calculate on this basis, we may be misled. A process of
self-purification is under way in this country—we look upon
non-co-operation as self-purifi-cation—and it would be wrong to
expect that the number of students with us must increase. It is good
if it grows, but we should retain our faith even if it does not grow,
and we must continue to serve this institution as long as we have the
faith.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I would indeed be sorry if it is a fact that the students have no
faith in the charkha. Those who have no faith in the charkha must
unhesitatingly leave the institution. You must remember the
resolution which the Congress has passed about national institutions.

remind you of it here. No one present on the occasion opposed the
definition of a national institution incorporated in the resolution.
If the opposition was kept hidden in the mind but not expressed,  it
would bring-discredit to me, to them, and to the country. How can I
believe that the consent given by so many intelligent, free and
mature men was not sincere? I would, therefore, say that the
definition was acceptable to thousands. Recently the Kathiawar
Conference has also accepted the definition. What is that definition?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
A national school to be classed as such must fulfil the following
conditions: Spinning must have a place in the daily routine. Teachers
and students must spin daily for half an hour and should wear only
hand-spun and hand-woven khadi. The medium of instruction should be
either the mother tongue or Hindustani. <i>Vyayam</i>, that is,
physical training including the art of self-defence, should be given
due importance. The school should endeavour to unite the hearts of
Hindus and Muslims. It should in no circumstances close its doors to
the untouchables. This definition of a national school has been laid
down by the Congress. Therefore, when I say that those who have no
faith in the charkha should leave the Vidyapith and other
institutions working under it, do not please think that I am
excessively harsh. This is the only way in which we can progress. It
will show us where we are going and how many men, women and students
are with us.</p>

My attention was drawn to certain criticisms of an article in
<i>Sabarmati</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><i>.   </i>Some   of   them   are   baseless   because  
I   have   never entertained the ideas I am accused of. I have never
said that the students should ply the charkha all the day; not that I
have never thought of it. If I could persuade students and other
countrymen that this would be most helpful to the country, I would
indeed ask all people to spin for the whole day. But I cannot
persuade the country today nor can I myself do it. If I can spin all
the time, I would advise the students and the country to do likewise.
My ambition is to be able to proclaim to India that real learning
consists in spinning round the clock. In a way, if you select any
pure activity and concentrate  thereon, it will lead to real learning
because it is a way of performing yoga. I won’t speak of this here.
I would merely ask the students to ply the charkha with faith and
joy, spin fine yarn, and learn all the processes of charkha. You
should have the same love and keenness</p>

The other charge is about a certain remark of mine that the Vidyapith
should make a scheme for a syllabus which would provide you with a
livelihood after graduation. I say this even now. But this is not and
should not be the principal aim before the Vidyapith or  before you.
If learning becomes merely a means of earning, it will lead to your
degradation. The Vidyapith has defined learning as that which leads
to liberation. Therefore, it would be wrong, in  this idealistic
institution, to learn merely for the sake of earning. There are many
ways for earning. Learning is intended to improve the body, mind and
soul. He has acquired real learning whose body is well-built and
strong, who can endure extreme heat and soul who has a strong will,
who is self-restrained and pure, whose soul is so pure that he can
claim to listen to the beatings of his own heart, and since the seat
of the soul is in the heart, his heart must also be pure. Why should
one who has acquired this triple learning worry about earning one’s
livelihood? One should have the faith that He who has given teeth
will provide the crumbs. I am being told that the students have to
run a household and feed many mouths. It may be so; a family should
be maintained and it needs courage to do so. But while acquiring the
learning described above, we also secure the ability to earn our
livelihood. Livelihood cannot be secured by searching.  One  who
looks upon learning as a mere means of livelihood does not secure
even that. The Vidyapith is making provision for livelihood even now.
It would be rendering you an invalid if it secures you a salary of
Rs. 300 or Rs. 30 immediately on your graduation and issues such a
letter to you. If such provision is made, it will sap your patriotism
and your self-confidence. The Vidyapith gives you the strength to
face difficulties and find a way out of them. The Vidyapith, in fact,
can give you nothing, it can merely bring out that is hidden in you.
You should therefore convince yourself that you have lost and are
likely to lose nothing by coming to the Vidyapith.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 102%">
The registrar has asked me to make suggestions about the future
development of the Vidyapith. But I am able to make no such
suggestions. I do not know what changes may occur in the situation in
India this year. I am full of hopes, and will remain so till I die.
But I cannot tell you just now what those hopes are; that would not
be</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
advisable. To the students, I would only say this: You should not
bother about what happens to the Vidyapith. It is enough for you to
know that your being here in this institution is the right thing for
you, and going to a Government school or college would have been
wrong, seeing that as things stand you would not have received there
the kind of education that you should. As long as you believe that
India did not get what she should have from  Government
institutions—and there is no likelihood of her doing so till she
shakes off the foreign bondage —the Vidyapith is the right place
for you and you must not think of leaving it. But if you feel that
you can get all that you want from Government institutions, you had
better go there. And in that case there can be no reason whatever for
you to worry about the future of the Vidyapith.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
You must banish from your mind the thought of Government schools, and
no student here should feel any attraction for them. As long as this
attraction lasts you will continue to compare the Vidyapith with
them. You will say to yourself: “There are so many facilities there
while here there are few.” That there are few facilities here is
the distinguishing mark of the Vidyapith. How shall we learn to
overcome difficulties if we create those same facilities here also?
Or, to put it in another way, the very lack of these facilities is
the facility offered to you at this place. There can be no comparison
between the Vidyapith and the Government schools. Once you grasp this
truth and have it fixed in your mind, there will be no need for you
to worry about the future of the Vidyapith. It should be enough for
you to be able to say that you have rendered your best help in the
struggle for freedom by doing your duty. You and I have no right to
know more than that. I know only this that the Vidyapith will exist
only as long as it is helpful in the struggle for freedom; when it
ceases to be so it will destroy itself. And what is wrong in its
being destroyed in that case? The future of Indian swaraj is the
future of the Vidyapith.</p>

Whatever is pleasant is not always beneficial. Even now when I have
grown old I know that everything that pleases me does not prove
beneficial to me. We do therefore consult elders on many occasions.
It is for this reason again that we have the ancient tradition of
finding out a guru and seeking his shelter and support. A student
used to prostrate himself before the guru and entreat him to guide
his steps and stuff his brain with anything that he chose. These days
an  all-round guru is not available and the question of complete

does not arise. However, you need here the assurance that the
teachers are leading you along the right path and not otherwise. Many
things are bitter in the beginning but beneficial in the long run.
With this faith you should swallow a bitter pill. This is my advice
as well as prayer to you.</p>

I wish to come back to the vow that you have taken. You have also
listened to the prayer read by our brother, Athavale<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>.Both these things looked very common. But we cannot see
power latent in common things. When an artist displays a trivial
painting in a hall we praise it because it is the fashion. But no one
ever cares for  the glorious painting right above our head. The
limitless sky, its brilliant stars and moon, the splendid hues at the
hour of sunrise and sunset— can any artist paint all these? We do
not, however, raise our vision but look lower and lower. That is why
we are captivated by trivial  paintings. This is a pitiable
situation. It is very likely that, in the same manner, you may not
have realized the significance of the prayer you have heard and the
vow that was administered to you by the registrar. You should
continuously ponder over them and try to fulfil  the pledge. The
noble <i>mantras </i>of the prayer convey a sustaining message which
cannot be imparted by speeches and writings. It is natural sustenance
like mother’s milk. What will be the result if a mother withholds
her milk from a new-born child and another woman offers him a lot of
other dainties? The child will not survive. This commonplace food is
like nectar. If we ponder over our ancient heritage, if we imprint it
on our hearts and act in accordance with it, our life’s mission
would be fulfilled. You may think no more of my speech and all other
things, but do not forget the prayer and the vow. Then your time and
mine would not have been wasted.</p>

It gives me much comfort to be able to have this unsolicited
declaration<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>from Rajagopalachari. The reader knows my regard for his
sanity and judgment. And I was grieved whilst he was torn with doubts
and fears. There is no “playing with truth” in the charkha
programme, for Satyagraha is not predominantly civil disobedience but
a quiet and irresistible pursuit of Truth. On rarest occasions it
becomes civil disobedience. But conscious and willing obedience 
must, in the case of a large body of workers, precede it. The charkha
which is the embodiment of willing obedience and calm persistence
must therefore succeed before there is civil disobedience. It is
because I am much afraid of playing with truth in even thinking of
civil disobedience before the necessary atmosphere has been ensured
that I must insist upon the charkha and upon full surrender to the
Swarajists, and for that matter to all concerned, even though the
workers may be reduced to the number of the digits on the fingers of
one hand only. We must not have violent disobedience under cover of
civil disobedience. The lesson of Chauri Chaura has sunk too deep in
me to be easily obliterated. Not only is there no trace of regret in
me for the Bardoli decision but I hold it to be one of the greatest
among my services to the country.</p>

including the President and the Secretary. I hope that the
signatories do not propose to carry their threat into effect. If
these gentlemen have voted for, or refrained from voting against the
spinning resolution for the sake of discipline or unity, I beg to
point out to them that the mere voting or refraining does not fulfil
the conditions of discipline or unity. To be effective, discipline
means the carrying into effect of the terms of the resolution in a
proper soldierly spirit of obedience although it may not commend
itself to reason. Such was the spirit of the Light Brigade whose
memorable charge has been made famous by Tennyson. Such was also the
spirit of the soldiers who, although they knew they were running into
the jaws of death, followed their general during the Boer war and
were riddled to death by the Boer bullets on the heights of Spionkop.
A mechanical assent by them to their general’s proposition that the
heights should be carried would have meant nothing, and would have
meant even disgrace. It was the action though reluctant yet as daring
as that of the staunchest believers that made them heroes. Be it
noted that they fought a battle in which defeat was a certainty. But
heroes are made in the hour of defeat. Success is, therefore, well
described as a series of glorious defeats. What if the franchise is
found at the end of the year to have produced a failure? It will be a
glorious defeat if the Congressmen irrespective of parties and
irrespective of willingness unwillingness will work their best to
make it a success.</p>

Nor is it proper to say as the signatories have said that many have
voted for the resolution for the sake of unity if they have not
intended to work in accordance with the resolution. Unity is made of
sterner stuff. It is not “a showy nothing” to be merely named on
a paper resolution. Unity to be achieved means solid action in terms
of</p>

the resolution. I do not believe the Councils. But because my
co-workers believe in it, I have given them the use of the Congress
name. Now if my heart does not co-operate with my lip or my pen, I am
a hypocrite and not a believer in unity. Having voted for the
resolution that authorizes Council-entry, I must wish well to the
Swarajists. I must in no way hamper their progress by any act of
mine; I must even help them wherever I can to the best of my ability
and if they fail, they should not be able to say that they have
failed because I refused to help within the limits previously and
mutually understood. Assuming that the No-changers do not in any way
whatsoever hamper the Swarajists, even the latter’s failure, if
there is to be failure, will be a success because at the end of it we
shall have found another way of compassing our end. Exactly
similarly, if all parties have done their best to make the franchise
a success and it fails, we shall all realize the fact frankly, accept
the defeat and jointly set about cutting another road to success. For
out of our defeats, if we are determined, we shall find the way that
leads us to our goal.</p>

And what is the difficulty these Kolaba friends find except that of
their own creation? If there is no cotton grown in their district,
let them buy it. Kolaba is nearer Bombay than Manchester. Will they
be surprised to learn that not a pod of cotton grows anywhere near
Manchester and the gentlemen there find no difficulty in importing
and carding and spinning it? I assure the friends of the Kolaba
district that they will not find it half as difficult as the citizens
of Manchester to import cotton in their district. Let me further
hearten them by telling them that if they have not the will to import
 cotton  and organize carding and spinning, the Congress resolution
permits them to buy hand-spun yarn and pay the required quantity to
the Congress. Have they the will to buy yarn? It will still be well,
provided that the yarn <i>is </i>hand-spun and is even and
well-twisted.</p>

Deshbandhu’s latest score against Lord Lytton is a brilliant
stroke. His ailing condition and his being carried to the Council
Hall on a stretcher adds a dramatic touch to the great victory. His
mere presence in an ailing condition constituted a speech far more
effective</p>

than any spoken word. If Lord Lytton has sufficient imagination and
enough of the sportsman in him, he should after all these repulses
withdraw the ordinance, release the prisoners and throw the
responsibility on those who voted with the Deshbandhu of dealing with
the conspiracy for murder which His Excellency believes exists in
Bengal. He must not complain of the conduct of the majority in the
Bengal Council because they have voted against him. The essence of
popular legislatures is that the Government that is responsible to
them must depend for its existence upon their reasoned support. They
may be obstinate, stupid or suspicious on occasions. The Government
has then to wait patiently for their conversion and be prepared to
run risks of misgovernment or even worse. Why should a popular
assembly be expected to be free from the limitations of an autocrat?
Lord Lytton does not claim for his measure capacity for securing
absolute immunity from political crime. But I very much fear that all
 the cogent argument that is being advanced by Indian publicists,
although it is almost unanimous in its condemnation of Lord Lytton’s
policy, will be lost upon a Government which has become habituated to
treat public opinion with contempt. Hence it is that I say to the
public men of India that if they will add force to their argument,
they must ply the charkha. It is the only creative energy that is
readily available to the nation. The discipline that Deshbandhu Das
has brought about in the Bengal Council will act with telling effect
as soon as but no sooner than the charkha has obtained a footing in
every home and boycott of foreign-cloth has thereby become an
accomplished fact. Oh, for one concrete act to the credit of the
nation as a whole!</p>

It was no light thing for me to advise the Kathiawar Political
Conference not to pass a string of resolutions on grievances of which
the delegates had no method of enforcing redress even if they were
capable of proof to the satisfaction of the public. I told them that
the Conference should first develop a spirit of public service and
sacrifice and then organized for redress of grievances. They would

felt and complained. This was the method of pacific resistance. The
Subjects Committee had no hesitation in accepting this advice. But
there was an interesting debate on the spinning franchise on which
the organizers</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
had prepared a resolution. It was, however, carried by an  over
whelming majority. This resolution differs from the Congress
resolution in that it requires the original member habitually to wear
khadi and not merely on state occasions. Here there was no 
disciplinary voting; everyone was free to vote as he chose.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It now remains to be seen how the resolution works. Everyone seemed
to admit that the success would depend largely upon the zeal,
earnestness and capacity of the principal workers who made them-
selves responsible for the resolution.</p>

The most startling event of the session perhaps was the solemn
resolution taken by Sir Prabhashanker Pattani to spin daily for at
least half an hour before taking his principal meal so long as he was
not too ill to turn the wheel. He has made no exception for travels,
for he contends, and rightly, that as he travels always first class,
he should have no difficulty about carrying the wheel with him and
spinning during his travels. It is a tremendous step for Sir
Prabhashanker. I hope that he will be able to carry out his
resolution. His example must give great encouragement to the
hand-spinning movement in Kathiawar. Needless to say that Sir
Prabhashanker is not expected to join the Kathiawar Sabha. I was
anxious to make it clear that though spinning has its political
aspect, every spinner need not concern himself with it. It was enough
for me if Princes and their ministers spun to set an example and as a
token of their identification with those they ruled. The peasantry of
Kathiawar has ample leisure. The people are poor. And if the fashion
of spinning is set by the ruling class and their ambassadors, the
people will adopt it and make a substantial addition to the national
wealth. The effect of the addition on individuals might be
imperceptible, but on the people as a whole it must be most marked.</p>

The reader will be interested to know how Sir Prabhashanker came to
take the resolution. He attended the Subjects Committee by invitation
as a visitor. After the Spinning Resolution was adopted I invited the
members to enrol themselves as spinners. I told them that at Belgaum
I had undertaken in common with others to enlist before the Ist of
March at least 100 members who would undertake to spin 2,000 yards
per months. I added, too, that I would have also two spinners from
among the “unwilling” class. I told the audience that I had hope
of Kathiawar giving me the 100 members and that among</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.3cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the two unwilling spinners I had Sir Prabhashanker in mind when I
gave the undertaking at Belgaum. Up jumped to his feet Sir
Prabhashanker and in solemn tones announced  the foregoing resolution
amid cheers.</p>

I was to be Sir Prabhashanker’s teacher. At the time of writing he
had only three lessons. On the third day he was able to spin within
less than two hours forty-eight yards of even, well-twisted yarn of
eight counts. As a matter of fact during the very first lesson
lasting half an hour he was able to draw a thread. He then asked to
be left alone to battle with the wheel. Let me hope that the other
administrators and ministers will copy Sir Prabhashanker’s noble
resolve to the benefit of themselves and the people under their
charge.</p>

Bhavnagar being a cotton centre, it was decided also to collect
cotton for distribution among those poor spinners who might be
disposed to give half [an] hour’s labour but may not be able to
give or beg cotton. As a result, over 275 maunds of cotton was
collected— not a bad result of two days’ begging. If the
enthusiasm continues, the spinning organization must prosper in
Kathiawar.</p>

The <i>Chronicle </i>invites me to explain my action or inaction in
connection with the Non-Brahmin Conference at Belgaum. It surprises
me to hear complaints of indifference on the part of the Congress
leaders regarding the Conference. Speaking for myself I was trying to
attend all the conferences consistently with the work I had gone to
Belgaum to do. The Non-Brahmin Conference that was held was not held,
so I was told, in response to Maulana Mahomed Ali’s invitation. It
was not held on the Congress ground. It was not held in consultation
with any Congressman so far as I am aware. I knew nothing of the time
or the place of the meeting except through the admission card that
was delivered to me in common with numerous such cards. Nevertheless
I was anxious to attend it and was trying to fit in my visit there
with my other appointments. Unfortunately I was attending to
business. I could not leave, whilst the Conference was proceeding.
When I finished my work and inquired I found that the Conference was
already dissolved. I state these facts merely to show that there was
neither disinclination nor discourtesy shown regarding the
Conference. What applies to me applies to most leaders. In my opinion
it was the duty of the organizers to consult me as to the time of the
Conference so as to ensure my attendance. And I would then have made
it possible for the other Congress leaders, too, to go. Maulana
Mahomed Ali’s invitation was not meant for a mechanical act of
holding others conferences during the Congress week. It was to</p>

bring the parties together in hearty contact. I find no fault with
the organizers of the Non-Brahmin Conference; I am simply endeavour-
ing to show that the Congress leaders would have gladly gone if they
could have and if they had been given an opportunity. Since writing
the foregoing I have seen Sjt. Gangadharrao’s explanation which

Scales and weights for weighing and all the necessary items for the

place in this movement, we shall be able to achieve only half of what
we wish to. In a way it is true that these volunteers are honorary
workers. They accept payment not because they covet it. However, the
public which wishes to avail itself of their services is under
obligation to make arrangements for their livelihood. Forty workers
are not enough for our purposes. In India we may need even four
hundred thousand volunteers. We do indeed need five to seven thousand
 workers for the task that we have undertaken and, in this poor
country, it is impossible that so many volunteers can work in an
honorary capacity. Even in European countries it is not possible to
get such people. God has not created us merely to eat and remain
idle. We have violated the universal law of nature—if a man eats
without working for his food and spends thousands of rupees,
thousands will die of starvation. The British historian Hunter’s
writing of India says that one hundred million people get barely one
meal a day and, that too, of <i>roti </i>and salt. The Congress too
has passed a resolution that we should not expect all volunteers to
be honorary workers. In order to set an example the leaders should
make a beginning. I too should, if necessary, accept an allowance. So
should Vallabhbhai. Of course, I get many things from friends.
Perhaps, today Vallabhbhai and I do not need an allowance; however,
if such an occasion arises, both of us will  get  ourselves 
recruited  as  paid  volunteers.  Take the  example of Tilak Maharaj
and Gokhaleji. When the Fergusson College was founded, both of them
had pledged themselves to serve the cause of education, content with
a meagre salary of Rs. 30/- Later on Tilak Maharaj gave this up for
certain reasons but, so long as he was there, he considered it an
honour to accept this sum. Gokhaleji, on his part, completed twenty
years he was a member of the Legislative Assembly, he served on many
committees, he received some money from this, but he had not ceased
to take the salary that he received from the Fergusson College. Even
when he became “great” and when he was in a position to get a
salary of Rs. 10,000 he did not regard the large amounts with the
same respect that he gave to his original salary of Rs. 75/-. He had
also very respectfully accepted a small sum by way of pension.</p>

It is not for volunteers to pay heed to public criticism. Those who
have nothing to do can do a lot of harm, hence volunteers should not
fear criticism coming from such individuals. Volunteers should regard
criticism as the food on which they live. One who cannot stand being
criticized by the world cannot become a volunteer. They should</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
be thick-skinned like buffaloes. A volunteer should be a yogi who
would keep on working with bowed head, look neither forward nor
backward and attend only to himself and his work. The volunteer who
holds that he has placed himself at the disposal of the public would
think day and night only of his work; however, he should not hesitate
to accept an allowance—not  <i>kheer</i><i> </i><i> </i>and  <i>pur</i><i>i</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>but
 <i>jawar </i><i> </i>and  <i>bajara</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. Those volunteers who have tried and got used to simple
food should get themselves recruited and remove the president’s
fear. Come forward if you wish to detain the president here. You may
never get another president who will be satisfied with so little.</p>

I must necessarily tell you about the mighty and momentous activity
in India today—that of khadi, that of the spinning-wheel; as people
keep opposing it, my faith in it gets ever stronger. Do not therefore
think that I am stupid and stubborn and stick to a thing
unintelligently. This object, of which I am speaking, I placed before
India only four or five years ago, but I had put forward my arguments
in its favour in <i>Hind </i><i>Swaraj </i>before ever having set
eyes on the spinning-wheel. Moreover, I find that the opposition to
it is not based on experience or thought, whereas my arguments are
based on an abundance  of  both.  I  regard  myself  as  a  
straightforward   person. I regard it my dharma to admit my own
mistakes. I do not approve of filth. To bear filth on the body, in
the mind or in the heart is a disease, hence not to admit a mistake
is also a disease. He who does not admit his mistakes before
God—although He is omniscient, He makes man strive and often
deludes him—one who does not admit one’s mistakes before God,
that is, before the world, will fall a prey to consumption, will
invite spiritual decay. This is even more harmful than  consumption
which is only physical. Only the body is wasted in one, while in the
other the spirit seems to be destroyed. The spirit is immortal,
indestructible; hence, even though there is an illusion of its
destruction it is not really destroyed. In imagining the destruction
of the soul which is immortal, one is stricken by a double disease.
Hence  I would not hesitate in the least to admit a mistake if I made
one. It does not matter if, as a result of this, all spinning-wheels
stop working and I am branded insane; but, then, I know that such a
situation has not arisen. I have such faith in the spinning-wheel
that even if my wife, my sons and my colleagues who are even closer
to me than my sons gave it up, I would all alone keep singing its
praises and plying it. Idleness is the great plague of India. It is
not a natural tendency. It</p>

could not be so for the peasant for, if that was the case, his fields
would be ruined. In our country, idleness crept in with the ruin of
the spinning-wheel. Crores of people became unemployed and to them
employment cannot be merely an amusement. Some say that they will
make baskets, others that they will make locks. Some wish to make
matches and others soap. These jobs cannot be taken up by the 
millions and, even if these things were produced by the millions,
they would find no market. If we work in this manner, there could be
no national unity but rather a crowd of individuals. Such work cannot
uplift us. It is for this very reason that I claim that what we need
in India is a supplementary occupation. There are hardly any villages
in Kheda which I have not visited and very few persons there whom I
have not met. Most of these have plenty of spare time. If I proclaim
that the spinning-wheel is the means of utilizing that time, it is
not met with general approval. The result is, some resort to theft,
others incur debts and yet some others starve. People who are in such
a pitiable plight, who are forced to remain idle, are bound to be
ruined. If they do not rouse themselves and rouse others too, they
will certainly be ruined. This is a law of social existence. It is
not a law which governs individuals but one which is true of society.
Crores of persons cannot make a livelihood by the spinning-wheel nor
has it been introduced as a source of livelihood, but it may be
described as <i>annapoorna</i>, which indicates ghee and milk.
Countless numbers of the poor cannot afford ghee or milk, they cannot
afford a drop of milk or a particle of ghee for their wheat gruel.
This situation is dreadful. The only remedy for it is the
spinning-wheel. One person putting in labour worth a rupee makes no
difference, but a town with a population of seven thousand earning
seven thousand rupees in this manner does make a difference. By
working the spinning-wheel, some other virtues are automatically
acquired. It is accompanied by simplicity, sincerity and regularity;
and regularity in one matter leads to regularity in one's entire
life, just as, if one angle of a crooked square is set right, the
other angles automatically resume their shape. This is a law of
geometry. When one bit of work is done regularly, all others become
regular. You will remember me too late if you do not take to the
spinning-wheel today. As soon as there has been only a small
downpour, you should raise the bunds and hold the water. He who tries
to do so when the water pours down in torrents cannot stop it and
consequently faces the loss of water as well as the bunds. Now, while
there is still time, I would ask you to be on your guard and wake up.
Do not like a miserly bania calculate what you can get from the
spinning-wheel, but think rather of the gain it will bring the
nation. In a small village of the size of Trapaj, people were
astonished when the figures were explained to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
them. Kathiawar is not a fertile region. Sticks and stones are all
that grow there. Moreover, as the land is unproductive, people sit
around the village square and chat idly not for six but eight months
in the year while some would perhaps even take opium. I explained to
the people of Trapaj how they could easily save two thousand rupees.
The larger part of the expense on a seer of cotton consists of
spinning, not weaving. If you use your own cotton, clean it and spin
it at home, the only expense would be that of having it woven. And if
this is all the cost that has to be incurred, we could compete with
the textile mills of the world. For textile mills have themselves to
incur almost the same cost on weaving as do handlooms. The people of
India understood this and hence they were as accomplished in the use
of the spinning- wheel as in cooking; with the disappearance of the
wheel we came to lead unholy and godless lives and ceased to fear
God. If you wish to have faith in God, to become pious,  to  protect 
your  sisters’  honour,  then  adopt  the  spinning-wheel.  In its 
wake  will  follow  the awakening of the country,  the  unity  of 
Hindus  and  Muslims,  the end of the country's poverty and the
salvation of all the peasants of India. The entire social structure
of India is based on the spinning-wheel.</p>

I have heard that you <i>Patidars </i>do not treat the untouchables
properly. If you look upon yourselves as Kshatriyas, you are not
entitled to use force against the untouchables, to browbeat them, to
practise the barbaric law of buying much labour for a small payment.
The <i>Gita </i>asks you to keep the gods pleased: “The gods will
give you rain, if you keep them pleased”. The gods are not in
heaven. For you, they are among the untouchables; they belong to the
labouring class. The poverty-stricken people of India are her gods.
Religion without compassion is a fraud. Compassion is at the very
root of religion and one who forsakes it, forsakes God; one who
forsakes the poor forsakes everything. If we do not look after the
poor and the untouchables, we are sure to perish.</p>

not about swaraj. <i>Ramarajya </i>can come about only when there is
likelihood of a Sita arising. Among the many <i>shlokas </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

who are worthy of being remembered prayerfully early in the morning.
Who are these women by taking whose names men and women become
sanctified? Among such virtuous women Sita’s name is bound to
figure. We never say Rama-Sita but Sita-Rama, not Krishna-Radha, but
Radha- Krishna. It is thus that we tutor even the parrot. The reason
why we think of Sita’s name first is that, without virtuous women,
there can be no virtuous men. A child will take after the mother, not
the father. It is the mother who holds its reins. The father’s
concerns lie outside the home and that is why I keep saying that, as
long as the women of India do not take part in public life, there can
be no salvation for the country. Only those can take part in public
life who are pure in body and mind. As long as women whose body and
mind tend in one direction—i.e., towards the path of virtue—do
not come into public life and purify it, we are not likely to attain
<i>Ramarajya </i>or swaraj. Even if we did, I would have no use for
that kind of swaraj to which such women have not made their full
contribution. One could well stretch oneself on the ground in
obeisance to a woman of purity of mind and heart. I should like such
women to take part in public life.</p>

woman can be recognized by the grace of her face. Must we then accept
all the prostitutes in India as virtuous? For it is their trade to
deck themselves up. Not at all. The thing needed for grace is not
beauty of face but purity of heart. A woman who is pure of heart and
mind is ever fit to be worshipped. It is a law of nature that our

They had scanty clothes, but I could not give them saris because I

they have clothes, because as long as one Indian woman has to go
naked it must be said that all are naked. Or even if a woman is

public service, then spin on the charkha, wear khadi. If your body

God. To spin for your poor sisters is to worship God. Giving in
charity to the poor means an offering to God. That alone is charity

not ask you to eat and drink with them, but to mix with them in order
to render service. It is meritorious to serve sick <i>Antyaja </i>boys
who are worthy of service. <i>Antyajas </i>eat, drink, stand and sit,

meritorious. My mother used to become <i>Antyaja </i>for some time

used to become an <i>Antyaja</i>. At this time she became an
untouchable . Our <i>Bhangis </i>also become untouchable when they do
their work. As long as they do not bathe, one can understand not
touching them. But if you would not touch them even when they have
bathed and tidied up, for whose sake do they bathe then? They have no
God even. They think others have the same kind of nose and eyes and
yet the latter despise them. What then should they do? Think of this:
Did Ramachandraji despise the <i>Antyajas</i>? He ate berries already
savoured by Shabari and he hugged the king of Nishadas, and they were
both untouchables. You can see for yourselves that there is no
untouchability in the Hindu religion.</p>

I feel sorry that we have only ten minutes within which to finish the
work of this Conference. For I have asked the <i>Antyaja </i>brothers
to come in at four. You have passed three resolutions. All the three
are very useful. You have resolved not to take alcohol; that is good.
Temperance is not the concern of your community alone. Members of
other communities also drink. You have passed resolutions saying that
you will not sell your daughters and abduct women. Those are also
good. You are Kshatriyas and you believe that you possess Kshatriya
virtues. If we look at our Shastras we find that a true Kshatriya
would not retreat after taking a step forward. Moreover, he protects
others. You realize without my having to tell you that it is the
quality of a Kshatriya to act in that manner and accepting  that 
principle you should not shirk your responsibility. A vow is a
pledge, an undertaking to do something, with God as witness. You have
vowed not to drink, not to sell girls or to abduct them. But if you
do not keep your pledge, it will be said that you have sinned against
the whole world. Each of the four <i>varnas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>must
adhere to the vows it takes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
To break a pledge is to retreat. So if you once raise your hand to
take an oath and then forget about it, you cease to be a Kshatriya.
You would feel ashamed and so would I. That would weigh on me. Having
promised Ravishankar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>who is working among you that you would not steal,
suppose you did so, what could he do? Government would punish you for
it. On the other hand, Ravishanker would suffer by fasting; by doing
so he would tell you that you had better kill him than break faith.
It is with this Ravishankar as a witness that you have taken an oath;
so if you break your pledge you will force him to fast. I am of
Ravishankar’s fraternity and know how to follow him. I know not how
to kill, but how to die. And remember that Ravishankar is not just
one person, but a full harvest. Having cautioned you thus, I ask you:
Will you keep your promises? This is not a theatre and I can’t act
myself. No community progresses through imitation. It is we, the
educated, who by our play-acting have corrupted you. So think well
before you raise your hand. The time has passed when a pledge could</p>

And now two other things. One, you must wear khadi. You must not
imagine that your country consists of only what lies between the
Narmada and Sabarmati. Yours is a large country. It is 1,900 miles
long and 1,500 miles broad. If you want to walk all that distance, it
will take 190 days. The people living in this country are your
brothers and sisters. It is necessary for you to spin yarn for them
and that yarn has to be given to the Congress. There is no other way
to make khadi cheaper. Spin for half an hour each day. If crores of
people do the same, khadi will cost nothing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The other is to make the <i>Antyaja </i>community your own. A
Kshatriya is the protector of the cow and the Brahmins. The cow is
not the animal with two horns, but any being in distress. <i>Antyajas
</i>are an unhappy community. If a Kshatriya forsakes the <i>Antyaja
</i>community, he ceases to be a Kshatriya. If people who deem
themselves to be Kshatriyas forsake the <i>Antyajas</i>, no one will
count them as Kshatriyas.</p>

I pray to God that He may sustain you in the fulfilment of your
pledges. If you mean to keep your pledges, then believe my humble
words. Those who wish to keep the vow should take the name of Rama on
getting up in the morning and before going to bed and pray, “Oh
Rama ! Bless me and help me keep my vow.” If you do that, you will
not be tempted by liquor, you will feel no lust when you look at a
woman. Our poor daughter is a cow. You would hate yourself if you
sold her.</p>

other castes, yet their children go to schools and go to the temple;
what perverse reasoning is this? Although I argue with them, I tell
you at the same time to  rid yourselves of the blot so that they will
have nothing to blame you for. You should bathe regularly after your
day’s work is over. I have done much scavenging, and so have my
sons; your Raojibhai, too, has done such work. There is no disgrace
in it. This work is sacred and the man who removes filth is doing
sacred work. You should also have a bath after cleaning hides. Good
men always clean their teeth, wash and bathe and keep their bodies
tidy. Do all this and tell the beads taking the name of Rama. If you
don’t have a rosary, tell the name of Rama on your finger tips.
Through the name of Rama all your bad habits are bound to disappear.
You will become purified and everyone will respect you. If you repeat
the name of Rama on getting up in the morning and before going to bed
in the evening, the day will go well for you and the night pass
without bad dreams. To remain clean, don’t eat what others have
left over, do not take stale food. Even if you get sweets others have
partaken of, go without them and eat  <i>ro</i><i>t</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>2</i></font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>

Lots of people will come and tell you that your Hindu religion is all
wrong, as you are not allowed to go to school or enter the temple. To
such people you should say, “We shall settle accounts with our
Hindu brothers; you may not come between us any more than you may
intervene in a quarrel between father and son or among relatives”;
and you should remain steadfast to your religion. I am myself an
outcaste. There are many like myself. Shall I give up my religion
because of that? Many Christian friends urge me to turn Christian. I
tell them there is nothing wrong with my religion. Why should I give
it up? Let me be an outcaste. If I am pure and clean, why should I be
unhappy? I have joined the <i>Antyajas </i>and if for that reason
Hindus persecute me, do I cease to be a Hindu? Hinduism is intended
for me and for my soul. Tell this to both the Christians and the
Muslims and be firm in your own religion. <i>Antyajas </i>are not

These gifts of coconut, yarn and money do not make  me  rejoice. I do
accept these; but my search is for true men. I visited a very fine
school in Varad. There are many fine teachers there, but many
children were withdrawn from the national school after the Vidyapith
resolution allow-ing <i>Antyaja </i>children to join it. I may make
it known that a resolution has also been passed for the merger of the
village school with the national school. However, what is the sense
in forgetting our responsibilities one moment and remembering them
the next?  Were we merely staging a play in 1921?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

The latter implies the courage to carry on with the unfinished job

means for securing swaraj. You must, however, pursue that which helps
the attainment of self-purification—khadi, the abolition of
untouchability and Hindu-Muslim unity. Practise these as your
ordinary dharma regardless of whether swaraj is secured or not,
otherwise we shall surely perish. Hinduism will be destroyed is

Whenever I go to Kathiawar, I am overwhelmed by the affection  I
receive. This has ceased to surprise me. Whenever I go, I see
Kathiawar. Yet, being an Kathiawar makes a difference. Can it be that
I myself need love from Kathiawar? Or, that I wish Kathiawar to make
an exhibition of its love? I cannot fathom the nature of my feeling.
Why should there be any exhibition of love in Kathiawar? What kind of
love is that which requires formal courtesies to express it?</p>

I did not go to Bhavnagar in the hope that the spinning-wheel would
be made a condition for franchise. Hence I was certainly  pleased to
find the resolution about the spinning-wheel. Parts of it were
overdone. It said that all members were to sell annually khadi worth
Rs. 50 and, members of the executive committee, khadi worth Rs.500. I
suggested that this condition should be dropped. If mem- bers
accepted responsibility to that extent, we could boycott foreign
cloth without delay. However, by incorporating something in the
franchise, which would depend upon co-operation from others, the
intrinsic merit of the franchise would be destroyed.</p>

to spread khadi will certainly do so. The discussion in the Subjects

fearlessly. I found that a considerable section expressed its opinion
against spinning. Their argument, however, did not appeal to a vast
majority. There were no two sections as Swarajists and No-changers in
this case. Hence the discussion centred round the merits and demerits
of spinning. There were two opposite standpoints. One was in favour
of spinning, while the other was opposed to introducing spinning in
the right to vote.</p>

The duty of those who have voted in favour of spinning is absolutely
clear. They have to prove their faith by steadfast spinning and by
spreading khadi in other ways. They will be regarded as  having
betrayed Kathiawar and myself if, in spite of having so voted,</p>

What is true of spinning is true of wearing khadi. I saw hardly any
opposition to wearing khadi. Despite so many votes in favour of khadi
it is sad to find so few khadi-wearers in Kathiawar. It is a great
pity that khadi is sent out of Kathiawar and that very little is sold
locally. However, now that so many votes have been cast in its favour
at the Conference, its sale must considerably increase in Kathiawar.</p>

There are about thirty-six members of the Kathiawar Political
Conference because they have paid a lump-sum contribution of Rs. 5.
One of them raised the question of their rights and asked me as the
President to give a decision in the matter. As the resolution
regarding spinning drops the clauses opposed to it, the question
arose whether life members did or did not retain their rights.
According to the resolution, clauses which opposed spinning were
automatically dropped. The question was a complicated one; however,
there was no alternative for me but to give a verdict. I have given
the verdict that life members continue to remain members even if they
neither spin nor make others do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
I have not given the decision whether or not the Conference has the
legal authority to do away with such rights. It was necessary for me
only to decide whether the resolution of the Conference made any
difference to the rights of the life members and, as mentioned above,
I have given that decision in favour of the life members.</p>

I would request them, however, not to take advantage of this right
but, instead, write letters to the Secretary of the Conference
informing him of having given up this right and having voluntarily
accepted the resolution of the Conference. I am aware that many
members did not wish to raise the above question. Many are prepared
to spin. Hence, when the Conference has adopted  an  important
change, it is not proper for the life members to disregard it  by
asserting their rights. This is my humble opinion.</p>

In some respects I regard Sir Prabhashankar Pattani’s pledge to
spin as a major achievement of the Conference. The words with which
he announced his pledge were very solemn. They left a very deep
impression on the members. That pledge originated in the following
manner. After the final session of the Congress at Belgaum,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>many
persons had come to the decision that they would enrol a certain
number of spinning members before the first of March. I had
personally undertaken to try and enrol a hundred names in this
venture, and I had also said I would try to persuade two additional
persons who were thought to be unwilling to spin. As I had to come to
Kathiawar in any case, I had hoped to find these persons here. I
counted Pattani Saheb among those averse to spinning. When the
Subjects Committee accepted the resolution on spinning, I asked for a
hundred names and also promised to try and persuade Pattani Saheb to
spin. No sooner had these words escaped my lips than pattani Saheb
stood up and took the pledge that as long as he was in good health,
he would spin regularly for half an hour before his meal. He then
laid down the condition that I should teach him how to spin. I got
what I wanted. At the close of the Confere-nce I was to be his guest.
The very day after the Conference, I taught him for half an hour.
Within that very half-hour, he learnt how to take out threads from
the sliver. On the second day, within two hours, he spun 48 yards of
fine eight-count yarn and on the third day he spun 27 yards within an
hour. On both the days he had his meal only after taking a bath and
spinning the yarn. In this manner, if other well-known officials and
members of princely families set an example in spinning, it would
make a good impression on the poorer sections of the people in the
country and make them industrious. I hope that  Pattani  Saheb’s
pledge will be fulfilled in all respects.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
I should inform you that he will not become a member of the Congress
or the Kathiawar Political Conference. Nor did I want or wish him to
do so. In my opinion, spinning is related to politics. However,
spinning can be undertaken even without political motives. Compassion
for the poor, the religious sentiment underlying spinning and its
economic implications are acceptable to all. I even wish that</p>

the children, women and men of Bardoli become diligent instead of
lazy. It is not that people who, by God’s grace, are wealthy need
alone become industrious. It will be a good thing if those who are
not altogether invalid have some work to do. The saying that an idle
man calls down ruin is true. We can improve our condition and banish
starvation by carding and spinning. You would not know about
starvation but the <i>Kaliparaj</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

less that of the animals. The condition of those owning land must be
better. Judging from the eyes and teeth of those who work with the
upper castes for a mere pittance, I do not think their state is too
good. In one village I saw many such <i>Dublas</i>.</p>

Hindu dharma tells us to have our meal only after serving the poorest
of the poor. Our dharma also tells us to tend weak animals. Even if
their ribs stand out they should not be killed. Even the ant- holes
should be filled with flour. We owe kindness to the animals. A
meticulous ethics that teaches this would not expect us to treat men
as animals. It would teach us to be compassionate to the poor. One

amends. The atonement would consist in your considering boycott of
mill cloth as dharma and in spinning. Narahari asked me, “May we
leave Sarbhon?” I said, “No. That would be the act of a coward.
If you do that people will get angry. You can’t run away from them,
or desert your post. You will have to stay there and make them see
that you do not want to harm them. That you can do only by serving
them, no by running away. Plant yourself firmly and do your work. If
no one accepts your work, you should keep on carding, spinning and
weaving.” I do not know if Narahari is soothed by my words. It is
another matter if he can’t bear all this but it is his duty to

allay your fears let me assure you that he has no quarrel with you.</p>

Sisters, I shall not be satisfied with coconut, yarn and money. I
expect many things from the women of Bardoli. I want you to give no
place to foreign goods. How good would it be if you wore a sari out
of hand-spun yarn? It is through you that I seek <i>Ramarajya</i>.
How nice it would be if everyone of you became a Sita? Your children
must learn both dharma and karma. Members of some of your families
remit ill-got-ten money from South Africa. But a weaver earns Rs. 40.
Your children will be happy if they learn this vocation. Cherish the
<i>Antyajas</i>. If any woman wishes ill of <i>Antyajas </i>she will
lapse from the grace of woman-hood. If you have any <i>Dublas </i>in
your household treat them with love and compassion. Give them <i>roti
</i>smeared with ghee. Prosperity comes to homes in which the
servants are well cared for. See what happens to the man who earns
through deceit. Millionaires are left heirless. May God give you such
purity of mind and heart that you may understand aright and take to
heart the prayer just heard.</p>

Some have taken up the business of deceiving the labourers and
through them serving their self-interest. Such people have done no

You have two causes of unhappiness. You drink liquor and toddy! You
are an example of all the misery that addiction to alcohol can bring.
Brothers and sisters of <i>Kaliparaj</i>, it is the new fashion to
think that not to drink alcohol is a sin. They enjoy saying that if
people do not drink, the habit will die out and therefore the trade
will disappear. Do not get entangled in this net. Let me remind you
that two years ago all of you had taken a vow not to drink. Stick to
that. If some doctor tells you that you would die if you do not
drink, do not listen to him. The body must perish sometime or other.
But the vow must not die. I grant the kind of decline that sets in
the body if you don’t drink. Once having given up drinking don’t
go back on your vow. Many persons fall into all kinds of temptations
and commit sins. If we are to be free of this, we should not allow
the slightest exception to what we consider to be the rules of good
conduct. If we leave a hole in the wall, insects, reptiles or thieves
might creep in; similarly, if there  is any gap in the wall of vows
raised to protect the soul, torrents of sin may rush in; and we may
repent too late. You should, therefore, shun liquor. Better keep away
from it.</p>

Your ignorance is not due to illiteracy. It is not a question whether
you can or cannot read and write. Many amongst you do not know how to

simplicity are divine qualities. Once the truth is told, the simplest

abstain from liquor. I am told that by appealing to some
superstitions I should encourage you to give up drinking. But the
country is full of superstitions, and I do not want to add one more
to the lot. If your drinking cannot be stopped without starting a new
superstition, it does not matter. What I mean to say is that if you
don’t give up drinking through your own understanding, your
abstinence will not be worth while. I wish you should give up liquor,
and so should people in the neighbourhood give up both liquor and
meat. The whole world should give up these; but not out of
superstitious beliefs, for if you do that, your abstinence will not
last long. One sin cannot be washed off by another. I hoped to help
you to rid yourself of superstition and convince you [to give up

You have complained against your Parsi brethren. I dote upon the

who drink. Parsis are engaged in the drink trade.  In  this business
they commit sins and atrocities. But what can I say to them? They
tempt you, give you gifts and even bribe you. What can I say to that?
If it were my business I would do the same. One has perforce to do

I have a complaint against you similar to the one against the Parsis.
There is a group amongst you which says that not to drink is a sin.
You can survive not by fighting with them but on the strength of your
vows and austerities. You tell the Parsis that you have given up
drinking, and then they would wind up their business. I have many
Parsi friends, including engineers, doctors, lawyers and business men
as well. One of them was an intelligent and generous business man. He
gave a large sum of money. He had started an Ashram also. Even if I
persuade the Parsis, someone else may come along tomorrow—say a
Christian, Jew, Muslim or Hindu may come and ask you to drink, how
can I go on persuading all of them? The best remedy therefore is that
 I should talk to you and convince you.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
I request the Gaikwar and the Vansada Governments to close down the
drink shops in their jurisdiction. But to persuade the Princes is a
difficult job. Even so I shall try. But they are like the Parsis; so
it is difficult to succeed with them. It is their business too and
they earn a large revenue from that. But you are their subjects—their
children, so to speak. It is my experience that it is easier to 
persuade  the children than the parents. I therefore have faith only
in you.</p>

What are the things that will help you to give up drinking?
Spinning-wheel is the chief amongst these. I have put all my faith in
the spinning-wheel. If India is to get salvation it will be only
through the spinning-wheel. I am delighted to see the young children
spinning and this has strengthened my faith in it. And it increases
day by day. The means of your livelihood is agriculture but you are
poor and find it hard to get food. In these circumstances the
spinning-wheel provides the thread of life and also produces peace.
When you feel like taking liquor sit at the wheel. As you ply it
slowly the craving for liquor will diminish. It will be enough if you
do this at my bidding. If the rains fail the crop will wither but the
spinning-wheel is ever fruitful. If you serve it well, it will become
an <i>Annapurna</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Along with the resolutions to be passed here, I want you to take a
vow. If you concede that abstinence is desirable then take a vow that
“we with God as our witness swear that we won’t take liquor or
toddy and persuade our brethren to do likewise.”</p>

everything, I want you to take a vow. If you have understood my views
on khadi, you, men and women, vow to wear henceforth only hand-spun

Brothers and sisters, I have made you take these two vows. And for
this purpose we have made God our witness. I wish that these two vows
may bear fruit. It is not easy to keep these vows, but I will show
you a device for keeping them; a secret which is the solace of the
poor. Many have swum across with its aid. I have told it to <i>Antyajas
</i>and <i>Dharalas </i>in Sojitra. Get up early in the morning,
rinse your mouth, wash your face, clean your teeth, remove the mucus
of the eyes and take the name of Rama. Rama means God. Repeating
<i>Ramanama </i>is a sovereign remedy. We must pray to him “O Rama!
let me stay pure and help me keep the vows I have taken at Vedchhi.”
Even if you are tired and feel sleepy [at night], take the name of
Rama for a minute and tell Him, “It is through your help that I
have been able to keep my vows. I should not smell of liquor even at
night, neither in my dream. And so, too, of forei-gn cloth.” Then
you need have no fear of ghosts. Rama does not need a coconut from
you. His hunger is for your love. He is seated in the hearts of all
men. You should know him. This clock is ticking. But Rama does not
have to make such noise. May He shower blessings on you all.</p>

am concerned. The offer was so striking that I warned the Maulana
against being over sanguine. He stuck to his guns. The promise was
too good to be withheld from the public. But the offer was a free
gift. And no prudent man will look a gift-horse in the mouth. As
things go even ten thousand volunteers is a good and encouraging
number. Let me remind Maulana Saheb that one must be a spinner to be
a volunteer. That is an old Delhi resolution stiffened at Ahmedabad
Congress in 1921. I shall therefore be satisfied with ten thousand
Mussalman volunteer spinners spinning every month two thousand yards
of good yarn with clock-work regularity. I do not doubt that if the
Maulana secures ten thousand spinners, he will have no difficulty
about getting even twenty-five thousand. For once the spinning
movement catches, it will gather strength like a snowball.</p>

same place and a <i>Kaliparaj </i>Conference at Vedchhi near Bardoli.
At all these conferences khaddar was much in evidence. The special
feature of the Farmers’ Conference was Dr. Sumant Mehta’s offer
that he would intern himself in the Petlad District for one  year  if
 he  got  forty whole time workers for the year. He was taken at his

over forty-five earnest volunteers at his disposal for the whole
year. This Conference had four classes of visitors, one of which
could gain entrance by paying a fixed quantity of hand-spun yarn. The
Conference cost the Reception Committee very little money. The
pavilion was spacious and unpretentious. Of course there were no
chairs, the wood-work and cloth, chiefly old khaddar, were lent.
Labour was volunteered. One of the citizens opened a free kitchen for
the strangers who required food. The guests were taken over by
another citizen and the delegates by a third. The arrangement proved
thoroughly satisfactory. Order was admirably kept by volunteers from
Professor Manik Rao’s pupils from his gymnasium at Baroda. The
proceedings were brief and to the point. The Chairman of the
Reception Committee took about fifteen minutes during which he  read
extracts from his printed speech. The President took not more than
thirty minutes for his address. Not a superfluous word  was spoken at
the meeting. The officials looked more like servants than like
leaders. The resolutions were chiefly concerned with things to be
done by the people themselves.</p>

<i>Dharalas </i>are a fierce military tribe in Gujarat. Their
occupation is chiefly farming. But through economic distress they
have taken to thieving. Murder is not an uncommon thing among them.
The wave of self-purification that passed through India in 1921 could
not fail to touch them. The class of workers that has come into being
 are  working in their midst with the sole intention of carrying out
internal reform among them. The brilliant satyagraha movement
initiated and led so successfully by Vallabhbhai during 1923 brought
about great awakening among these people. Their Conference at Sojitra
was one of the fruits of the reform. They assembled in their
thousands. They listened to the proceedings in perfect silence. The
resolutions carried were about abstaining from intoxicating drinks
and drugs, from selling their daughters in marriage and from
abduction, a habit which seems to be rempant among them.</p>

devoted to khaddar and the wheel. The Farmers’ Conference lasted

Whilst the arrangements for the Conference at Sojitra were  simple
and effective, those at Vedchhi surpassed all expectations. The
remark immediately escaped my lips that I had not seen a conference
so grand as at Vedchhi for its simplicity, naturalness and  artistic
beauty. He who selected the site and conceived the whole arrangement
was undoubtedly an artist child of nature. The spot selected lay on a
river bank. The river ran between a row of homely hills shaded with
trees and shrubs. The bed of the river was sandy, not muddy. The main
platform was erected in the waters of the river. It rose nearly eight
feet high. A sandbag was the first step to the platform. The whole
meeting lay in front of the platform, the people occupying even the
ridge of the hill opposite. The decorations were all bamboo and green
leaves. There was not a single portrait arranged anywhere, not a
scrap of paper was used for decoration, and not even yarn. Yarn is
out of place for such decorations and much too valuable to be wasted.
The canopy was split bamboo and green leaves. The effect was
soothingly beautiful. On either side of the road that lay in front of
the platform, huge masses of men and women, over twelve thousand, sat
in perfect silence. There was no entrance fee. All were delegates.
There was no distinction between delegates and visitors. (I don’t
present this fact for imitation. Here it would have been cruel to
have made the distinction which in organized bodies is inevitable.) A

from the meeting a long strip of the bank alongside of the line of
hills was occupied for the charkha exhibition. Old men and old women
and little boys and little girls ranging from five to ten years were
plying the wheels. There was method about having only old people and
youngsters. The middle-aged spinners were busy rende-ring service as
volunteers all drawn from the <i>kaliparaj</i>. Near the row of
charkhas was a portion allocated for khaddar  manufactured in
Gujarat. There was therefore no question of having the fine Andhra
khaddar. Those of the <i>Kaliparaj </i>who wore khaddar used only the
coarse stuff. A very small portion contained pictures of the
all-India leaders and a selection of literature. The thing cost
literally nothing. The bamboo and the leaves belonged to the people.
They brought the material and arranged it under supervision and
without remuneration. No arrangement had to be made for victualling
the thousands who came either on foot or in carts, the nearest
railway station being twelve miles off the Conference ground. The
people brought their own cooked or uncooked food. They camped in the
open wherever they liked. Everything was done without bustle and
without noise.</p>

This was the third year of their Conference. At all their Conferences
only a limited number of resolutions  were  adopted. There was one
about drink which is the curse of these people, another about khaddar
and a third about discarding stone ornaments worn by their women. The
resolutions about drink and khaddar were in the nature of vows. The
audience solemnly undertook themselves not to drink and gently to
persuade their neighbours to do likewise. The other vow bound them to
ply the wheel and to wear hand-spun to the exclusion of all other
cloth and to persuade others to do likewise. I took pains to see that
they understood what was being said and what they were asked to
commit themselves to. Volunteers were sent to the farthest ends of
the meeting to ascertain whether they were following the proceedings.
The wind being favourable the voice carried exceptionally well
without much effort. They, both men and women, took the vows with God
as their witness. Let the reader understand that they had been
passing these resolutions for the past two years. Almost all of them
had some part of their dress in khaddar. They had taken to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
it readily and intelligently. Hundreds had learnt how to spin. Some
of the young men were trained at the Ashram at Bardoli to become
expert carders, spinners and weavers. A few even earned their
livelihood by weaving. The audience was therefore really prepared for
the vow regarding khaddar and spinning as it was regarding
intoxicating drinks.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I closely examined an old man of sixty to know what actuated him to
spin after a hard day’s toil on his farm. He spins at the rate of
about four to five hours per day. He needs little sleep. He therefore
spins at night and gets up early again to be at the wheel. I thought
he would tell me that he was spinning for pleasure or for others. I
was agreeably surprised to find him give me an economic reason. He
said, “I spin for myself. I grow my own cotton. Now I weave my own
clothes in my own family and save ten rupees per head per year.”
The sight of these people organizing all the processes for themselves
should convince the hardest unbeliever of the necessity of hand-
spinning and khaddar. Here in the midst of the most ignorant
villagers village organization of the trust type is quietly going on.
It is revolu- tionizing their lives in every department. They are
learning to think for themselves.</p>

I held the meeting of the elders after the Conference  was finished.
Over thirty of them including ladies gave their names as workers.
They are themselves pledged to spinning, wearing khaddar and to total
abstinence; they are each to try to enlist five such inside of five
weeks at the end of which they are to meet again to consider how
further to develop the reform movement.</p>

It is easy enough to take a vow under a stimulating influence. But it
is difficult to keep to it especially in the midst of temptation. God
is our only Help in such circumstances. I therefore suggested to the
meeting <i>Ramanama</i>. Rama, Allah and God are to me convertible
terms. I had discovered that simple people deluded themselves into
the belief that I appeared to them in their distress. I wanted to
remove the superstition. I knew that I appeared to nobody.  It was
pure hallucin-ation for them to rely upon a frail mortal. I therefore
presented them with a simple and well tried formula that has never
failed, namely to invoke the assistance of God every morning before
sunrise and every evening before bedtime for the fulfilment of the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
vows. Millions of Hindus know Him under the name of Rama. As a child
I was taught to call upon Rama when I was seized with fear. I know
many of my companions to whom <i>Ramanama </i>has been the greatest
solace in the hour of their need. I presented it to the <i>Dharalas
</i>and to the untouchables. I present it also to the reader whose
vision is not blurred and whose faith is not damped by over-much
learning. Learning takes us through many stages in life but it fails
us utterly in the hour of danger and temptation. Then faith alone
saves. <i>Ramanama </i>is not for those who tempt God in every way
possible and ever expect it to save. It is for those who walk in the
fear of God, who want to restrain themselves and cannot in spite of
themselves.</p>

To hearten those teachers and pupils who are frightened at the
Congress definition of a national school or college, I would like to
mention two schools whose teachers and pupils I met during these
conferences. One is at Sunav, a village in Anand Taluka and the other
at Varad in Bardoli Taluka. In both these schools all the boys are
zealous spinners. In Varad the boys card their own cotton and make
their own slivers. They are regularly giving some yarn to the
All-India Khadi Board from month to month. I was able to have a long
chat with the Sunav boys whom I found to be exceptionally
intelligent. They knew why they were spinning. The contribution they
gave for the sake of the poor, and they spun otherwise in order to be
self- contained so far as their clothing was concerneded. I would
invite the curious to visit these schools and find out for themselves
how they are working. Their position was at stake when the Gujarat
Vidyapith insisted on their taking untouchable boys. The teachers
braved the storm. Some boys have left but the schools are
flourishing. At Varad the parents who had withdrawn their boys on the
admission of untouchables have now undertaken to send their children
back to the national school. There need be no fear of national
institutions suffe- ring because of the definition of the Congress,
if only the teachers and managers will combine firmness with
gentleness, humility and toler- ation.</p>

<i>Kaliparaj. </i>It literally means black people. The name seems to
have been given to a portion of the people of Gujarat by  those  who
regarded themselves as superior to them. So far as colour is
concerned the <i>Kaliparaj </i>are no blacker than or different from

years ago. Thousands left off drink and even  flesh-eating.  This 
proved too much for the liquor dealers.Most of these were parsis. It
is said that they tried all the means possible to induce the
teetotallers to revert to drink and that they succeeded to a great
extent. The officials, too, are said to have conspired against the
reformers. And  now, whether as a result of these efforts or
otherwise, there has sprung up among these people a party who teach
them to regard temperance as a sin and by ostracism and other means
seek to break the spirit and the zeal of those who are battling
against themselves and an evil habit handed down from generation to
generation.</p>

One of the resolutions passed at the meeting of which I have taken a
fairly long notice elsewhere was to ask the States of Baroda,
Dharampur and Vansda and also the British Government to close down
all liquor shops. This is a big order, it will be said. The attempt
of a whole nation to bring about total prohibition, it will be added,
failed miserably. How then can the ineffective appeal of a handful of
helpless men and women succeed? There is a great deal of force in the
argument. And yet the two attempts stand on a different footing. The
attempt of 1921 was directed against the British Government by non-
co-operators who were bent on wresting power from the Government. It
was moreover directed by those who had not themselves suffered from
the existence of liquor shops. Now the appeal comes from those who
have been a prey to the evil. It is an appeal from the powerless to
the powerful. It is addressed to all the governments concerned and
not merely to the British Government. These men are no non-co-
operators. They do not know the difference between co-operation and
non-co-operation. They slave for others unwillingly, almost unknowi-
ngly, and often under fear of oppression. They do not know what
swaraj is. To them giving up drink and removal of the temptation in
the shape of liquor shops is swaraj. Their appeal therefore is on
humanitarian grounds and should prove irresistible.</p>

Councillors to forgo the liquor revenue even though they may have to

It is different with the States of Baroda, Dharampur and Vansda. They
can, if they will shut up the liquor shops and save their people and
themselves from destruction. I use the pronoun “themselves”
deliberately, because the destruction of a large body of people in
small States means their own destruction. Will they not listen to the

And of the Parsi liquor dealers? I know that it is with them a
question of livelihood. But they belong to one of the most enter-
prizing of races among men. They are resourceful and intelligent.
They can easily find other honourable means of liveli-hood. Men and
women have been known before now to give up questionable callings and
take up work or professions conducive to the moral growth of society.
I claim the right to speak to the Parsis, for I know and love them.
Some of the best of my associates have been and are Parsis. They have
done much for India.   They  have  given  Dadabhai<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

liquor dealers commence by abstaining from interference (assuming the
truth of the charge) with the reform.</p>

	I have your letter concerning the <i>Chronicle</i>. I discussed the
	matter with Motilalji here yesterday. In my opinion, it would be
	better if Belgaumwala does not get involved in it. We certainly do
	not wish to oppose the Swarajists. The spinning-wheel has very
	little need of the Press. That has always been my experience. The
	spinning-wheel reaches where the newspapers do not reach. Its reach
	will extend still farther. I would advise Belgaumwala, Jamnalalji,
	etc., to use their money and intelligence only for the spinning
	work. We shall take only as much help from the Swarajists as they
	can give</p>

We are collecting cotton instead of money. Hence the system of
maintaining accounts is bound to differ. If accounts are maintained
after due thought from the beginning, it will facilitate matters
greatly in the future. Arrangements have to be made for collecting
cotton, stocking it properly and incurring expenses for the various
processes through which it has to pass. Moreover, some will hand in
yarn spun from their own cotton, while some others will hand in yarn
spun from cotton given to them by the Conference. Hence, two sets of
accounts will have to be maintained. Then again, the accounts for the
yarn that is used should be separate. The account books will multiply
in this manner. This work can be done only with patience, forethought
and understanding.</p>

A gentleman raises the question whether those taluks which  allow the
contribution of two thousand yards of yarn spun by others should be
entitled to the above prize. Although it may not have been clearly
stated, the prize is only for those who do their own spinning. The
khadi-lover’s intention is not to reward that taluk which excels in
recruiting members who get their yarn spun by others. I hope that
there will be keen competition for this prize. The amount of Rs.100
is no consideration. It is the prize that is important, not its
value. Even Borsad, if it takes it upon itself, can, by making the
maximum effort, recruit five thousand members.</p>

Sojitra have spoken of the <i>Patidars </i>as <i>Kheduts. </i>The
custom of discarding old names as contemptible and coining new ones
is not worthy of emulation. There is no merit in being called a

It could be said that the <i>Patidars </i>of Sojitra became <i>Kheduts
</i>for at least two days. This is because they took upon themselves 
the burden of providing the necessary help for the Conference. A
<i>Khedut </i>is always a labourer. He is great by virtue of his
labour. <i>Patidars</i>, both great and small, served in Sojitra and
thereby added to their own dignity.   The   workers   themselves  
put   up   the   <i>pandal</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

the minimum. Some members shared among themselves the responsibility
of providing meals for the guests, delegates and others. In this
manner things were better organized and the reception committee was
spared that expense. The work of the Conference was facilitated since
it was given all necessary facilities by the Baroda Government.</p>

Along with this <i>Patidar </i>Conference, separate conferences of
<i>Dharalas</i>, women and untouchables were also organized. As these
had been arranged one after the other, those who wished to attend
them all could easily do so. <i>Dharalas </i>have now come to regard
themselves as <i>Baraiya </i>Kshatriyas. If, however, I may advise
them, I would ask them to stick to the name <i>Dharala </i>and
sanctify it. No purpose is served by changing a name. Status is not
gained by assuming the name but only by acting in a manner befitting
the Kshatriyas.</p>

Having made this criticism, I have nothing but praise for the

resolutions too only dealt with reforms amongst them. The evil
customs of taking liquor, forcibly carrying away women and selling

It is also the Kshatriyas’ dharma to abide by his pledge. The

The number who attended the women’s conference at Sojitra exceeded
all estimates. One finds that most <i>Patidar </i>women observe
<i>purdah</i>. In spite of this, the Conference pavilion was filled
with women. The attendance was enough justification for the
Conference. No resolution seemed to be necessary. It should be a
matter of satisfaction that they listened attentively to speeches on
the spinning- wheel. If a resolution had been proposed hands would
have been raised but it was all unnecessary.</p>

The Conference of the <i>Antyajas </i>was held in the very same
place. The organizers deserve to be congratulated on their courage in
permitting this Conference to be held in the same <i>pandal</i>. It
is a good sign that even though untouchability is not yet entirely
abandoned by the <i>Patidars</i>, the Conference was held under the
same roof. Many who were not untouchables attended the Conference.
This Conference took the pledge to give up liquor, to ply the
spinning-wheel and to wear khadi. Each word in the pledge had been
explained to the men and women. Of the latter a large number was
present. They had brought incense with them. I was misled by the
smoke I saw. I presumed that they were smoking  <i>bidi</i><i>s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

Although the Conferences held at Sojitra were good in their own way,
the Conference of <i>Kaliparaj </i>left on me a deeper impression.
Underlying the former were commonsense, simplicity, economy and
skill. All this was also there in the <i>Kaliparaj </i>Conference,
but in addition it was artistic. I cried out unwittingly: “I have
seen many conferences, but in point of unstudied beauty, I have not
seen one like this.” I see no exaggeration in these words. It
seemed as if nature</p>

herself had invisibly arranged everything. In my opinion, true art
consists in learning from nature without struggling against it. I
could be said of Vedchhi village where this Conference was held that
it comprises little more than a few wells and a few houses. The
<i>Kaliparaj </i>however do not live in houses or villages but in
their grass huts and fields. The population of Vedchhi could not be
more than three or four hundred people. However, as compared to the
cluster of grass- huts of the <i>Kaliparaj</i>, the cluster of houses
in Vedchhi could be said to be fairly decent. In view of this, the
Conference was arranged at Vedchhi. Ordinarily a field is chosen as
the site of the Conference. Our artists looked around and chose a
spot which was filled with natural beauty. A river named Valmiki
flows near Vedchhi. It dances along between rows of hills adorned by
trees. The organizers of the Conference chose this spot. The main
rostrum was placed in the flowing water and, just as branches spring
out of a tree, the seats for the delegates were arranged in front of
the main rostrum. As it was winter, and, moreover, as the water was
cool, this artistic expert argued that not only did the delegates did
not require any shade but the afternoon sun at 2.00 p.m. would be
welcome to them, hence the golden sky provided the dome of the
pavilion and the river sand, the seats. As this river flows on one
side of a hill, the bank stretching from the opposite row of hills to
the edge of the river is dry. There is no mud on the river bank but
only sand. Hence no artificial adornment or carpets and such other
things were needed. The canopy above the rostrum was made of bamboos
and green leaves. A broad pathway led right up to the rostrum.
Bamboos had been used for this purpose too and creepers of the arum
plant had been entwined on the path. The first step leading to the
rostrum was made of a sack filled with sand. There was not a single
picture here and not a single strand of cotton was used for
decorative purposes. One need not add that even decorations made of
yarn cannot enhance the beauty of such a spot. Yarn is man-made and
is in place in a house. Where the sky is the ceiling and sand the
ground, only trees and leaves harmonize with the scene. Moreover, one
who loves yarn would not waste it. On the contrary, he would store up
even a yard of yarn or a wad of cotton.</p>

A little distance away from the site of the Conference but still on
the banks of the river and at the foot of the row of hills, an
exhibition of spinning-wheels and khadi had been arranged. Old  men 
and women as well as children, both boys and girls ranging from six
or</p>

seven to ten years of age, were plying some fifty spinning-wheels.
This arrangement too had been well conceived. The youths had become
volunteers. Some of the Khadi had been spun, woven and dyed by the
people of <i>Kaliparaj </i>themselves. The rest of the coarse khadi
had been sent by the Gujarat Khadi Bhandar. Along with the
exhibition, the special flute of <i>Kaliparaj </i>was being played,
and there were pictures of a few prominent leaders and some
literature. Little had been spent on all these arrangements. The red
and yellow  buntings, etc., made of thin foreign paper which are
usually conspicuous in <i>pandals </i>could not be seen even if one
searched for them. Decorations made of such paper show neither taste
nor discrimination. It is like trading one’s  sleep for
sleeplessness. Whenever I see such paper decorations, I am pained at
this outrage on art. Even Sojitra could not rise above this.</p>

The <i>Kaliparaj </i>is well tied up by yarn. They themselves grow
cotton. The people are poor and simple, they wear foreign cloth.
However, they have not developed a liking for it. If khadi is
available at low price, they would certainly wear it. As the sari
worn by the women is short, with the lower hem tucked into the
waistband, it weighs less. Hence, the spinning-wheel and the
propaganda for khadi seem to be popular among these people. A
sixty-year old peasant, even though he looks after his field,
regularly spins till late at night and at dawn. He had his own
clothes made out of the yarn and he wishes to give what remains to
his children. In this manner the goal is for one family after another
to spin and weave for themselves. When I asked this old man the
reason for his spinning, he replied that it was in order to save
money. He saved Rs.10/- which was his annual expense on clothes.</p>

<i>Kaliparaj </i>means black people. They are not so called because
they are darker than those belonging to other castes. Those belonging
to the higher castes, however, showed contempt for them; hence the
name. Today they are in a very pitiable plight. Timidity,
superstition and addiction to drink are ruining them. In spite of the
fact that they live in jungles, they are afraid of everyone and
everything. Drinking liquor is their greatest failing. Toddy  or
liquor is ruining the community. There has been some reform since
they too joined in the awakening of 1921, yet much remains to be
done. Liquor has taken</p>

such hold of them that many regard drinking as something meritorious!
When the agitation for prohibition started, a section arose which
took upon itself the task of breaking up this movement and began
harassing those advocating prohibition. It is said that the Parsi
owners of liquor shops were behind this. If <i>Kaliparaj </i>gave up
liquor for good, that trade would come to a standstill and the owners
of liquor shops would suffer. Looking as it from this standpoint it
is difficult to blame the owners. However, I believe that I have a
right to address them too. I am a great admirer of the Parsi
community. I am closely associated with many Parsis. I have great
respect for that community. Hence the owners of liquor shops will not
misunderstand me. Many persons, we know, had given up a trade which
is harmful to others. These gentlemen are enterprizing and
resourceful. It is not as if they cannot take to another trade if
they give up this one. Whether they go to this extent or not, I hope
that they do not join hands with the advocates of liquor in order to
keep their business going.</p>

Yet God’s mercy works where man’s efforts produce no result.
Hence I have requested the <i>Dharalas</i>, the <i>Antyajas </i>and
the <i>Kaliparaj </i>to chant the name of Rama. They should wake up
in the morning before sunrise, brush their teeth, rinse their mouths
and pray to God asking Him to help them in the fulfilment of their
pledges, and they should chant the name of Rama. The same should be
repeated before going to bed at night. My faith in <i>Ramanama

friends. It has saved them from many mental anxieties. One who

Bardoli could do anything if it wished to. The <i>Patidars </i>of
that place are far-sighted. Many of them have gone as far as South
Africa and undergone sufferings. The taluk is financially well off.
Excellent cotton is grown there. A great deal of effort has been put
into this taluk. Volunteers from other parts of Gujarat have gone and
settled down there. Ashramas have been built. Money donated by the
late Parsi Rustomji has been spent there. Bardoli is famous
throughout the country.</p>

What will the <i>Patidars </i>of such a place do? If they choose to
do so, they can introduce the spinning-wheel in each home, spin their
own cotton, wear clothes woven out of it and boycott foreign cloth.
This task is child’s play for Bardoli.</p>

Kunvarjibhai and Laxmidasbhai have taken the first step. They have
both entered into a pact under which one provides the cotton and the
other gets it woven. They have made this division of labour.
Kunvarjibhai has pledged himself to collect 2,000 maunds of cotton,
Laxmidasbhai to get it spun. If this succeeds, Bardoli would shortly
become self-sufficient in cloth. May God make Bardoli famous.</p>

True, there is cow-protection to some extent in Gujarat, but then
Kathiawar is an exception. Nonetheless, there too, when there is a
famine, cattle are abandoned. I have seldom been satisfied with our

ground for dissatisfaction. In Arabia the horse is almost worshipped
and is religiously taken care of. I do not know why we in India are
so heartless towards the cow. The cattle in Europe are simply

During last month I had a hearty discussion with an English friend
who takes deep interest in matters Indian and who is anxious to serve
India to the best of his ability. He asked me whether I would publish
the gist of our conversation. I readily agreed but asked him to jot
down the points he raised which he gladly did. I do not disclose the
friend’s name as the name does not matter. It is my views that
matter because they are exciting some interest at the present moment.
If I am a friend of Englishmen, as I claim to be, I must patiently
answer all the doubts that may arise in their minds. The English
friend put the questions not all on his own behalf but mostly on
behalf of those Englishmen who had originally raised them.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; margin-top: 0.17cm">Here
are the questions with answers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.25cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">What
is the real purpose of your insistence upon the khaddar programme as
a means of obtaining swaraj?</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
I am interested in the attainment of swaraj only by non-violent and
truthful means. This is possible only through a diligent and
successful prosecution of the khaddar programme. Swaraj can be
peacefully attained only if the whole Indian mass work as with one
will, be it on ever so little a constructive and useful thing for
ever so little a time. Such an effort presupposes national
consciousness. This is possible only through the spinning-wheel. It
is not remunerative enough for individuals. It is therefore not
enough incentive for an individual selfishly inclined. It is however
enough to raise at a bound the national prosperity in an appreciable
manner. An increase of one rupee per head per year may mean nothing
to the individual. But Rs. 5,000/- in a village containing a
population of as many would mean the payment of land revenue or other
dues. Thus the spinning-wheel means national consciousness and a
contribution by every individual to a definite constructive national
work. If India can demonstrate her capacity for such an achievement
by voluntary effort she is ready for political swaraj. Any lawful
demand of a nation with a will of its own must prove irresistible. I
have hitherto said nothing of the immense economic value of the wheel
and its product khaddar. For it is  obvious. The economic prosperity
of India must indirectly affect the course of her political
history—even using the word “political” in its narrow sense.
Lastly, when the exploitation of India by Lancashire ceases by reason
of the ability of India through the wheel to clothe</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
herself and consequently to exclude foreign cloth and therefore also
Lancashire cloth, England will have lost the feverish anxiety at any
cost to hold India under subjection.</p>

I do. After all I am asking for very little. Millions are indifferent
as to what they wear. They merely look to the cheapness of the
articles they buy. It is the middle class whose taste has to be
revised. I do not think that the substitution of foreign cloth by
khaddar is an impos- sible task for them. Moreover it should be
remembered that nowadays it is possible for khaddar to suit a large
variety of tastes. And improvement in fineness is making steady
progress. I am therefore of opinion that if any constructive work is
capable of success, it is the khaddar programme.</p>

By swaraj I mean the Government of India by the consent of the people
ascertained by the vote of the largest number of the adult
population, male or female, native-born or domiciled who have
contributed by manual labour to the service of the State and who have
taken the trouble of having their names registered as voters. This
Government should be quite consistent with the British connection on
absolutely honourable and equal terms. Personally I have  not
despaired of the substitution for the present servile condition of
equal partnership or association. But I would not for one moment
hesitate to countenance or bring about complete severance if  it 
became necessary, i.e., if the connection impeded India's full
growth.</p>

Not in the least. At the time of the Saha resolution I was opposing
an internal error. At the present moment I am resisting external
oppression based on erroneous assumptions. Moreover, my attempt then
to secure consistency of conduct and control of the Congress
executive by one party must not be confused with my action on the
Saha resolution. The two things were totally different and were not
even inter-related. As soon as I discovered that the attempt to
secure unity of control led to bad blood, I retraced my steps and
declared complete surrender to the Swaraj Party.</p>

Moral authority is never retained by any attempt to hold on to it. It
comes without seeking and is retained without effort. I am not
conscious of loss of moral authority, for I am utterly unconscious of
being guilty of any single act compromising my moral conduct. What I

number of educated men in my presentation of the means of attaining
swaraj, e. g., the spinning-wheel.</p>

I do not insist now. But I do not admit that every one of the
activities has failed. On the contrary, every activity of non-co-
operation succeeded to an extent. I can speak only of its suspension
because to me non-co-operation is a vital principle of life and
because in my opinion it had done India and, if you will, the world
an amount of good of which, at present, we have not adequate
conception and also because, if I found an atmosphere of substantial
non-violence and real co-operation among the people and if the end
remained still unattained, I should not hesitate to advise its

mutual respect and trust and by insisting upon Hindus surrendering
out of strength to the Mussalman in every mundane matter and by
showing that those who claim to be nationalists and are in an
overwhelming majority should stand out in any unseemly competition

end by demonstrating that real swaraj will come not by the
acquisition of authority by a few but by the acquisition of the
capacity by all to resist authority when it is abused. In other
words; swaraj is to be attained by educating the masses to a sense of

nature to distrust a single human being or to believe that any nation

because I recognise their bravery, their spirit of sacrifice for what
they believe to be good for themselves, their cohesion and their
powers of vast organization. My hope about them is that they will at
no distant date retrace their steps, revise their policy of
exploitation of undisciplined and ill-organized races and give
tangible proof that India is an equal friend and partner in the
British Commonwealth to come. Whether such as event will ever come to
pass will largely depend upon our own conduct. That is to say I have
hope of England because I have hope of India. We will not for ever
remain disorganised and imitative. Beneath the present
disorganization, demoralization and lack of initiative I can discover
organization, moral strength and initiative forming themselves. A
time is coming when England will be glad of India’s friendship and
India will disdain to reject the proffered hand because it has once
despoiled her. I know that I have nothing to offer in proof of my
hope. It is based on an immutable faith. And it is a poor faith that
is based on proof commonly [so] called.</p>

I am unable to congratulate the Jamiet on its resolution. It seems
that both the parties have made up their minds on the main fact
although no impartial inquiry has yet been held. Is it an established
fact that the responsibility for “the entire series of deplorable
events” lies with “the person or persons who published at Kohat
the offensive and provoking pamphlet”? Is it also an established
fact that “the Hindus who fired shots and killed Mussalmans are
also responsible for aggravating the delicate situation still
further”? If the two facts above mentioned are clearly established
the Hindus at least are not entitled to any sympathy which the Jamiet
shows for the loss in life and property suffered by them. For they
have reaped what they have sown. The Jamiet is therefore inconsistent
in showing sympathy to the Hindus. And what is the point in the
Jamiet telling me and other political leaders  that  “unless 
scurrilous  attacks  on   religion and   founders of religious
movements are absolutely stopped the creation and</p>

sibility of unity a fact for the Jamiet to note as well as the
political leaders? And must Hindu-Muslim unity be impossible because
some person delivers attacks on religion? According to the Jamiet one
 insane Hindu or one insane Mussalman is enough to make Hindu- Muslim
unity impossible. Fortunately Hindu-Muslim unity does not finally
depend upon religious or political leaders. It depends upon the
enlightened selfishness of the masses belonging to both the
communities. They cannot be misled for all time. But I hope that the
original resolution of the Jamiet does not read as bad as the
translation before me.</p>

A correspondent asks me to give my impressions of the interview I had
with Mian Fazl-i-Hussain during my last visit to Lahore. I gladly
comply. I had a very pleasant time with the Mian Saheb. His manners
were most charming. He was reasonable and plausible in his
conversation. He protested against the charge of partiality brought
against him by Hindus. He said that he was trying to do tardy justice
and that too in an incomplete manner to the Mussalmans. He was
accessible to all and was anxious to explain his own position to
anybody who cared to study the question. More than this, no man had a
right to expect. Whether as a matter of fact there is anything to be
said against the Mian Saheb’s policy, I do not know. I have not
been able to study the question on either side. When I am able to do
so I shall gladly publish my opinion of Mian Fazl-i- Hussain’s
claim that he has done less than justice to the Mussalmans.
Sufficient in the meantime for me to feel that in Mian Fazl-i-Hussain
one has a gentleman, calm, cool, dignified and reasonable to deal
with.</p>

Orders are pouring in at the Ashram at Sabarmati for spin-
ning-wheels, spindles, slivers, etc. If we were well-organized, such
helplessness should be impossible. Time was when every village
carpenter could make a spinning-wheel. Today city carpenters often do
not know what a spinning-wheel is like, and they equally often refuse
to make one from a model. Similarly, whereas formerly every carder
knew how to make slivers, today they shrug their shoulders or</p>

want to charge exorbitant prices. But the success of hand-spinning
depends upon our resourcefulness and upon the co-operation of the
artisans of India. No single institution can meet the growing demand
for the wheel and its accessories. Fortunately things are improving
but not as fast as they ought. Those who are in need should make a
desperate effort to get these things made in their own cities or
districts before ordering things from the Ashram. No doubt it is
better to get them even from the Ashram than wait for an indefinite
period of time for them. So far as slivers are concerned, I agree
with Mr. K. Santhanam<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>who
showed in his admirable  essay  that  every  spinner should make his
own slivers. Carding with a small bow is an incredibly simple and
easy performance. It is learnt much more quickly than spinning. And
good carding invariably adds to the output of yarn and facilitates
its evenness. For those who spin for wages carding adds to their
earnings. There are carders all over India who can make a full living
out of carding. A good carder can earn twelve annas per day— not so
a good spinner. Every Congress Committee worth the name must have a
depot for making and supplying wheels and the accessories.</p>

I have already given my opinion in such cases. I have no doubt that
even when the boycott of courts was on foot it was the duty of
Congress Committees to proceed against fraudulent and defaulting
debtors. The boycott was not meant for the Congress to commit
suicide. It presupposed honesty on the part of those who dealt with
the Congress.</p>

	It is likely that the picture is completely true. I have personally

country, since the fear of social opinion disappears. But there is a
difference of degree between the guilt of the two parties. The
Muslims accept and rear the children of love and bring them up in
their faith. If the provision made by the Muslims were not available
for the children of the Hindus, the latter would simply starve to
death. Since the children are the fruit of mere sensual
gratification, their Hindu fathers do not care in what religious
faith they are brought up. In my view, a man so blinded by lust has
forsaken his religion. It is difficult for me to regard anyone who
obeys no moral principle in his conduct to be a religious man. For
purposes of census persons born into a certain religion may be
regarded as belonging to that religion, but really speaking they have
renounced religion. There is nothing apart from conduct which may be
defined as religion. It is not the one who repeats  the  Gayatri
mantra<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>every
day or studies the Vedas that truly belongs to the Vedic religion,
but the one who lives according to the teachings of the Vedas is a
true follower of the Vedic religion. Some Christians make a deep
study of the Vedas and other scriptures, but that along does not
render them true followers of the Vedic religion. In other words,
those who recite the Gayatri and other mantras hypocritically or
because they are ruled by superstition, are not followers of the
Vedas. Their claim of belonging to any religion can be accepted only
if they understand the teachings of that religion and follow them in
practice to the best of their ability. Judged from this point of
view,  the  Hindus  of Tanganyika should be considered to have
forsaken their religion.</p>

This is only an abstract solution. In practice, these Hindu or Muslim
fathers are regarded as Hindus or Muslims, as the case may be, and so
we should find a solution which will work in practice. The Hindu
fathers should convert such union into regular marriage and take
their children under their loving care and make necessary provision
for their education, etc. This is a solution to the problem of the
children already born. In future, however, everyone intending to go
and live in a foreign country should take his family along with him.
For those children, however, whose fathers are altogether heartless,
there is no other solution except opening orphanages. Such</p>

orphanages should best be opened in the countries in question. We may
assume that the mothers of the children will stay with them in the
orphanages. These mothers had sacrificed themselves to earn their
livelihood. They are, however, not aware of the sinful aspect of
their conduct. For, though Negroes have the institution of marriage
among them, it is not considered immoral for a woman to offer her
body for money. Such women, nevertheless, do feel the mother’s love
in their heart. We should tend it and encourage them to do their duty
as mothers. In these pitiable cases, the child’s mother-tongue is
different from its father-tongue. Which language should it be taught?
 The father generally feels little attachment for his children born
in this manner and so the latter learn the mother’s language.
Hence, those in charge of the orphanages should teach these children
their mother- tongue. If they are taught both the [father’s and the
mother’s] languages, they will be better equipped to earn their
livelihood in future.</p>

The problem of their religion is more intriguing. It does not arise,
as we have seen, as far as the Muslim fathers are concerned. But it
is the general rule that the children of a Hindu father should be
treated as Hindus. I have no doubt in my mind that, following this
rule, the children of Hindu fathers should receive instruction in
Hindu religion. The children themselves are helpless in this matter.
They will assimilate the atmosphere in the orphanages where they are
brought up. If these are run by men imbued with a religious spirit,
they can instil it in the children.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
I hope that the Hindus living in Tanganyika and such other
territories will think and consider what their duty is, and do it.
Their first duty is to overcome their lust. This refers to the
future. To bring up properly the children already born, to provide
for their religious instruction and in every way to do their duty as
fathers—this is their duty at all times. Those who can should take
their wives with them. A man should judge a woman’s condition by
his own. If a man cannot endure separation for a long time, neither
can a woman. That men and women married at a proper age should not
remain separated for a long time needs no proof. In not remaining so
lies the guarantee of the purity of their character.</p>

What a great advance in reform can be brought about if other [public]
servants emulate this example! Through such work one serves both the
Ruler and the people, and one’s own interest as well. This couple
will, by and by, have all their cotton and woollen garments made from
yarn and wool spun by themselves. We have noted that among the
<i>Kaliparaj </i>tribals the annual expenditure  on  clothes amounts
to Rs. 10 for every person. The expenditure in the family of this
correspondent must be even higher. He will save considerably on that
expenditure and, in the bargain, will have acquired a skill, earned
the blessings of the poor and learnt something about the varieties of
cotton and wool and how to improve their quality. At this time when
spinning and allied activities are making good progress in Kathiawar,
I wish that officials of all grades who come into frequent contacts
with the public in the course of their work should teach the people,
as this correspondent does, to spin and do other work relating to
khadi. This friend wants a portable spinning-wheel which can be
carried on horse- back. Others, too, are likely to ask for such a
wheel. But the right solution is that people in every village should
have spinning-wheels in their homes. Whether in Kathiawar or
elsewhere, there ought to be no village without at least one
spinning-wheel. If in a village there is none, arrangements must be
made to instal them, so that officials can borrow them and do their
spinning. If all the people take up spinning, there should be in the
central meeting place in every village two or three spinning-wheels
which may be used by the <i>patel</i><i>s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

also by the poor people and the officials on their visits. Meanwhile,
however, the idea of having a portable spinning-wheel which can be

run by the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. One such letter is
lying before me just now. I notice from it that there is some
misunderstanding about this matter. I have never advised that the
Provincial Committee should run no khadi store. What indeed I have
suggested is that a khadi store which runs at a great loss or in
which the loss is increasing, instead of diminishing, should be
closed down, and that buying khadi for a store from outside Gujarat
should be stopped. This advice is inspired by nothing else but a
careful calculation and some knowledge of economics. I cannot, even
in my dream, wish ill of other provinces and well to Gujarat. It is,
however, of the very essence of the principle of swadeshi that one
should serve one’s neighbours first. This principle is violated
when wheat from the south is preferred to the wheat produced in
Gujarat and the procedure, therefore, is detrimental to Gujarat, to
the south and to the whole country. The philosophy of khadi had its
origin in this principle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Let us now examine the aims we hope to serve through khadi. The first
is that it will revive Indian villages. This can happen only when
every village produces its own khadi. This in its turn is possible
only if every province produces its own khadi and uses what it
produces.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The second aim behind khadi is to bring about a boycott of foreign
cloth through it. This can be achieved only if India manufactures all
the cloth its population requires. If Indians demand cloth similar to
the foreign product, India cannot meet that demand. Indians,
therefore, should accustom themselves to wear, with pleasure, such
cloth as the country produces. If all the people insist on wearing
only khadi manufactured in Andhra, Andhra cannot meet all that demand
and the boycott of foreign cloth can never be  achieved.  Every
province, therefore, should try to produce fine khadi. For the same
reason, every province should produce its own khadi. As a general
rule it is observed that, so long as there is no demand for a
commodity, no effort is made to produce it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 95%">
This certainly does not mean that no one should wear or order Andhra
khadi. My only point is that the Congress at any rate should always
adopt the ideal course. If it wishes, the public will adopt the
second best course. If, because the ideal course is difficult, even
the Congress does not adopt it, no one else is likely to do, and
without such efforts success is impossible.</p>

I notice that spinning has now spread considerably and, in
consequence, there is a great demand for supply of spinning-wheels by
the Ashram. The latter cannot provide all the spinning-wheels
demanded. Nor can the movement progress in this manner. Each
province, each district, each taluk and, finally, each village should
be able to boast of a carpenter who can make spinning-wheels. The
spindle-holders are now made of string or coir. The benefits of the
spinning-wheel movement are not confined to the spinners and weavers.
It provides work to carpenters and blacksmiths, too. There will be no
section of society which will not share in the benefits.</p>

It is but natural that at this time when a determined effort is made
to spread the khadi movement in Maha Gujarat we should require a
large number of volunteers. We need both part-time volunteers and
full-time volunteers. It is essential that every volunteer should
know all the processes connected with spinning. Any persons who wish
to offer their services as such volunteers may send their names to
me, so that as and when the need arises their services may be
utilized. This request for names is not addressed to those who are
already working some-where or other. I invite, however, the names of
persons who are able and willing to serve but who have had no

	 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>from
	Bengal on the question of untouchability. The writer is still

	Madras correspondent in the form of questions. It is a healthy sign
	that the orthodox Hindus are moved to an inquiry into this thorny
	question. There  is  no  denying the earnestness of the framer of
	the questions. They are typical because there is hardly one among
	the long list that has not been put to me in my rambles. In the
	hope, therefore, that my answers may guide the path of the
	correspondent who claims to be a worker and an earnest seeker, and
	such other workers and seekers, I make an attempt to solve the many
	riddles presented by my correspondent.</p>

I am not. But if the untouchables are purposely shut out by the
influential classes, it would be an improper exclusion barring the
road to swaraj. My disapproval of communal representation does not
mean exclusion of any community from representation but, on the
contrary, it lays the burden on the represented communities to see to
the proper representation of the unrepresented or inadequately
represented communities.</p>

I sympathize with the friends who talk to me in this strain. I am
prepared to recognize the limitations of human nature for the very
simple reason that I recognise my own. But precisely as recognizing
my own limitations, I do not decieve myself by refusing to
distignuish between what I ought to do and what I fail to do. I must
not deceive others by refusing to notice the same distinction and
telling them that what they propose to do is not only perhaps
defensible but also right. Many things are impossible and yet are the
only things right. A reformer’s business is to make the impossible
possible by giving an ocular demonstration of the possibility in his
own conduct. Whoever thought it possible before Edison to speak to
people hundreds of miles away from us. Marconi went a step further
and made wireless communication possible. We are daily witnessing the
phenomenon of the impossible of yesterday becoming the possible of
today. As in physical science so in psychological.</p>

pulling down the structure. Any building of the shape of a mosque is
not a mos-que. A building to be a mosque must be duly consecrated. A
building put up on another’s land without his permission is a pure
robbery. Robbery cannot be consecrated. If A has not the will or the
capacity to destroy the building miscalled mosque, he has the right
of going to a law court to have the building pulled down. Law-courts
are forbidden to convinced non-co-operators but not to those who
require such conviction. Moreover, full non-co-operation we have
never practised. A practice has a flaw in it when it is not only
inconvenient but clearly defeats the end it was desi-gned to serve.
So long as I own property I must defend it whether by the force of
law-courts or by the force of my own strong arms. The act is in
essence the same. Our national non-co-operation is or was with a
system. It presupposed co- operation among ourselves in a general
way. But when we non-co- operate among ourselves, national
non-co-operation is a mira-ge. Individual non-co-operation is
possible when we own not a clod of earth. It is possible only for
<i>sannyasin</i>. The highest fulfilment of religi-on therefore
requires a giving up of all possession. Having ascertained the law of
our being, we must set about reducing it to practice to the extent of
our capacity and no further. That is the middle way. When a robber
comes to take away A’s property he can deliver the property to him,
if he recognizes in him a blood brother. If he does not feel like one
but dreads the robber and would wish that someone was near to knock
him down, he must try to knock him down and take the consequence. If
he has the desire but not the ability to fight the robber, he must
allow himself to be robbed and then call in the assistance of
law-courts to regain the lost property. In both the cases he has as
good a chance of losing his property as of regaining it. If he is a
sane man like me, he would reach with me the conclusion that to be
really happy he must not own anything or own things only so long as
his neighbours permit him. In the last resort we live not by our
physical strength but by sufferance. Hence the necessity of uttermost
humility and absolute reliance on God. This is living by soul-force.
This is highest self-expression.</p>

The All-Party Committee met to consider the questions referred to it
by the Conference. It appointed a sub-committee of nearly fifty to
consider the question. The sub-committee appointed a smaller
committee to consider all possible swaraj schemes and report to the
sub-committee the results of its deliberations. Dr. Besant is
labouring at this smaller committee with her usual application and
energy which put to shame younger men and women. But naturally the
attention centred round the Hindu-Muslim problem; not that it is
intrinsically more important except for individuals like me but
because it blocks all progress towards swaraj. The sub-committee
proved too formal for the task. It was necessary to avoid the reserve
and the stiffness even of a committee and to be absolutely informal
and to have a still smaller number of persons. This was done and a
few of each community met at Hakim Saheb’s house. The result has
been succinctly given to the Press by Pandit Motilalji Nehru. I agree
that there is no cause for anxiety or disappointment. For all want a
solution. Some want it at once, some regard the time not to be
seasonable, some would sacrifice everything to get a solution, others
would be cautious and would wait till they have secured what to them
is an indispensable minimum. But all agreed that a solution of the
problem was essential to swaraj. And</p>

who are engaged in finding it. The prospect was never so bright as
when we parted to meet again on 28th February. Meanwhile everyone is
to explore fresh avenues to a settlement.</p>

The statement made by the Deputation is substantially correct. It
was, however, not in 1896 but probably in 1894 that the assurance was
given. I am writing from memory. The facts are these. It was in 1894
that the first disfranchising bill was passed by the Natal Assembly.
Whilst it was passing through that assembly a petition was presented
to  it on behalf of Indians wherein it was stated that the Indians
enjoyed in India the Municipal and indirectly even the political
franchise. Fear was also expressed that the deprivation of the
political franchise was likely to be a prelude to that of the
Municipal Franchise. It was in answer to this petition that the late
Sir John Robinson, the Premier of Natal, and the late Mr. Escombe,
the Attorney General, gave the assurance that there was no intention
to go further and deprive the Indians of the Municipal Franchise at a
future date. The disfranchising bill was disallowed by the superior
Government but another non-racial in character was passed. The
assurance referred to by me was several times repeated by Mr. Escombe
who had charge of all the bills and who was virtually the dictator of
Natal’s policy whilst</p>

I have before me a curious letter in which the writer says, a
distinction is being made by Congressmen in Sind between Swarajists
and Congressmen, and the former are obstructed by  the  latter.  I
should have hoped that such a thing would be impossible after the
Belgaum Congress which recognizes the Swaraj Party as an integral
party of the Congress and which suspends the non-co-operation
programme. Every Swarajist who subscribes to the Congress creed and
conforms to the new franchise is as much a Congressman as the one who
is not a Swarajist, that is to say, who does not believe in Council-
entry. Let it be also remembered that the Swaraj Party has itself
altered its constitution to make it obligatory on every member of
that party to accept the Congress franchise. There should therefore
not only be no obstruction by one of the other but each should help
the other wherever the help is not inconsistent with one’s
conscience.</p>

purpose of sale on the market. It is not possible to object to such

and to give it as their subscription, should beware of buying yarn in
the bazaar. They should try to get their quota spun in their own
families. If that be not possible they should engage a reliable
spinner and get him to supply the yarn. The Akola Congre-ssmen who do

	I can endorse the correspondent’s complaint as to waste. It is a
	good custom to present leaders with yarn garlands but they should be
	prettily made and not much yarn should be used in them. If the idea
	be to present yarn to leaders and not to garland them, the
	correspondent’s suggestion should be adopted and uniform  size 
	hanks should be given. For, if the habit of presenting yarn garlands
	becomes universal and care is not taken, there might be an enormous

I have no doubt about the meaning of the word “habitual”. My
correspondent’s meaning is the only possible meaning. A school
cannot be called national, in terms of the Congress resolu- tion,
whose scholars do not wear khaddar as a rule. But in seek- ing to
know the meaning of words, the safest rule is “go to the
dictionary”. Here is the meaning given in the Concise Oxford
Dictio-nary of the word “habitual”: “customary, constant,
continual”.</p>

The question then arises: are the schools which cannot fulfil the
test then to become affiliated as Government institutions? Surely
such is not the only alternative or for that matter any, for a school
that has non-co-operated. There is room enough for schools
independent both of the Congress and the Government. There may be
schools whose conductors do not believe in Government patronage,
control or interference and yet may not believe for instance in khadi
or in teaching the vernacular or Hindustani. There is no reason why
such schools should not continue if they receive public support or
the conductors are themselves rich enough to carry them on
themselves. All that the Congress has done is to prescribe the limits
within which it can recognize or support educational institutions.
And what can be more natural than that the Congress should insist on
Congress institutions conforming to conditions which in the opinion
of Congressmen promote the interest of the country?</p>

I have been asked to give my impressions of the volunteers’ work at
Belgaum during the Congress week. I thought that I had already dealt
with it in my Belgaum impressions. But I gladly respond. Their work
will bear a fuller and separate treatment. In my opinion the
volunteers reached at Belgaum comparatively the highest watermark in
efficiency within my experience of four Congresses. They were
hardworking, efficient and willing. I heard no complaint from the
delegates about them. Physically too they appeared to me to be fit.
Dr. Hardikar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>was good enough to take me through their camp which had
a businesslike appearance and was fairly tidy. I say fairly tidy for
in my opinion a volunteer camp must be a model of tidiness, not a
thing being out of its place and everything being not only in its own
place but being in its place in a neat manner. For instance, a
volunteer may have his bedding in its place and yet may have put it
in  a heap instead of having properly and neatly folded it in the
prescribed manner. In point of sanitation too a volunteer camp must
be perfect, not a scrap of paper or dirt should be found anywhere. I
understand that Dr. Hardikar specially restricted the number of
volunteers. They had therefore more than a fair share of work to do.
During the time that the Congress was in session they had to work
over sixteen hours per day, being on their legs practically the whole
of that time. I must not omit to mention the lady volunteers. They
were most helpful and attentive. They too had undergone previous
training. Though we cannot manage a Congress session without the
efficient help of volunteers, let me say that work is the least part
of  a  volunteer’s training. Volunteers must be our greatest asset
in winning swaraj. This they can only be, if in addition to having a
spotless character and the necessary training in drilling, sanitation
and first aid to the injured, they know how to organize the nation
for swaraj. For this purpose therefore every volunteer must be an
expert carder and spinner, and must be able in addition to doing his
share of spinning, necessary for the franchise, to organize carding
and spinning in his own district. It should be remembered that
hand-spinning has been</p>

between the highly educated among both. And I suppose it is an
undeniable fact that the so-called higher education is not so common
among the Mussalmans as among the Hindus. I should like my
correspondent to examine the figures as to higher education and say
whether I am not right. Meanwhile let the students of statistics
analyse the returns reproduced above and inform me of any inaccuracy
in them. I have taken it for granted that the absence of figures for
the provinces not mentioned by the correspondent shows that the
figures in respect of them were not favourable to the charge brought
by him. So far as literacy among women is concerned, I am glad to
find that the percentage among Mussalman sisters in so many provinces
is higher than among Hindu women. It shows that the <i>purdah </i>is
no bar to literacy. This is no defence of the <i>purdah </i>for I am
totally opposed to it. I note the fact as a pleasant surprise. For
whilst I knew that many Mussalman sisters though remaining in
seclusion were learned, I did not know that literacy among them was
higher than among Hindu sisters.</p>

I was present here last December and held some talks with you.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

returned to Kohat, I would come back and would talk to you; and if

Some Muslim brothers have come from Kohat and I am talking things
over with them. As a result of these discussions I am in no position
to advise you to go back to Kohat. I was hoping that by holding talks
with them something good might turn up. I am not without hope but
today I do not have a single reason for asking you to return to
Kohat. In fact I feel like advising you to the contrary. It is
possible that I may not succeed in my task with the Muslim brethren.
Moreover those Muslims who have got a hold over Kohat have not come
here. On the other hand they have sent a telegram saying, “A
compromise has already been reached here and the Hindus are returning

The implication is that Shaukat Ali and myself should not interfere
in this matter. But while talking to the Muslims who have come here I
asked them, “Do you take the responsibility of taking Hindus to
Kohat?” One of the gentlemen frankly replied, “If the Hindus want
to return to Kohat, let them do so but we can take no responsibility.
We are not even in a position to invite them, the reason being that
those who are there at present are hated.” So I cannot advise you
to go back to Kohat.</p>

There is yet another matter. If you want to return there relying on
the strength of the Government and if the talks with the Government
have inspired some faith in you, you are free to go back. But even
now I hold firm to the belief that we are not going to benefit by
working with or through the Government . And therefore I do not
advise you to go there under the protection of the Government.
Wherever you stay you have to rely on your own strength.</p>

If there is need for holding talks with anyone before returning to
Kohat it is with the Muslims. In the first place their number is
large. Even if they were equal in number it would not be good to
return without holding talks with them since we have run away from
there in fear. It is a different thing if someone goes there and
sacrifices ones honour for the sake of money or for saving one’s
life. To me it is not a life worth living, it is veritable death.</p>

I learnt something very distressing yesterday namely, that many among
you embraced Islam to save your lives and then you came here. In my
view such poeple have not truly embraced Islam but have done so under
fear and in order to save their lives. If it were not so why should
they say, Cut off my tuft “or Make me  read  the  <i>Kalama</i>”?
If we do so the <i>Gayatri </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>would have no meaning and our Hinduism too would be
deemed meaningless. This is true or Sikhs and Arya Samajists as well.
What I mean to say is that we should be prepared to lose our lives
but not to change our faith. Our true wealth is not money, land or
gold. They can be pillaged. But our true wealth is religion. When we
abandon that we can be said to have pillaged our own homes. Ever
since I heard these things I feel there is nothing to be gained in
your going and staying there. You are losing much through love of
wealth and life.</p>

Sometimes Muslims kidnap a woman and make her embrace Islam. I do not
understand how, in this manner, she can become a Muslim. She does not
know the Koran. She does not know the <i>Kalama</i>. Alas, she knows
very little even of her own religion. I cannot understand how she can
become a Muslim. If someone abducts my wife and she reads the <i>Kalama,
</i>then I can no more live in this world. Either I would seek your
help [in defending her] or beg you to take her back into the Hindu
fold. I would be a coward if I did not act in this manner. I cannot

then make a solemn declaration that as long as conditions do not

well flee from the Frontier Province. I think it would be right if

I could not swallow that argument yesterday about  the possibility of
a Hindu woman being converted to Islam. I wish to have this point
further clarified by Muslim friends— does Islam teach them to
abduct my wife? My wife might not even know what Islam and
Christianity are about. She was born in a Hindu family, she chants
the name of Rama, and reads the <i>Ramayan</i><i>a </i><i> </i>and 
<i>Bhagavata</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. She cannot use her intellect in embracing Islam. She
continues to stick to her own dharma and that too with complete
faith. What should one make of it if someone comes and tells one that
such a woman has embraced Islam? She has not embraced Islam in full
knowledge and therefore she is not prepared to regard herself as a
Muslim. I want to ask Muslim friends: Does their religion teach them
to abduct anyone’s wife and make her a Muslim? It is unbearable for
me if any woman living in the Frontier Province is forcibly violated.
If it is argued that she has embraced Islam, I am not prepared to
believe it. That is why I want to tell you that if you hold your
religion dear, then do not go back as long as Muslims there do not
say, “Come back with honour”; you should not go till then. If you
go back you might make money but if you forsake your dharma and live
there, that life is not worth living.</p>

So far you have not died of hunger. In December I told you that I
couldn’t bear any able-bodied man living by alms, i.e., by begging
for food. If I advise you to do that, I would be doing a wrong thing.
Even today I am firm in this. That is why I have not asked for a
single pie for Kohat. I would collect funds only when I know the
purpose for which they are collected. I have made no list. It is true
that if someone has sent something to me [for the relief of Kohat
Hindus], I redirect that there. But if you act on my advice and those
who are able-bodied live on their own labour, I pledge you my full

lawyers and get us a practice”, that I can’t do. I can’t get
you a brief by getting two persons to quarrel. Similarly if some
businessmen demand rupees ten or twenty lakhs or ten thousand, I
certainly can't give them that. I can only provide you some kind of
work. With this end in view I tell the people of India that everyone
should ply the charkha at least for an hour daily. The charkha is a
symbol of labour. One who plies the charkha can do other work also. I
can't offer you work on land. But there is plenty of work by way of
spinning, ginning and weaving from which lakhs [of people] can earn
their livelihood. I read in the newspapers that the Maharaja of
Mysore has also started spinning on the charkha. If those among you
who are artisans want implements for their vocation, such as
gold-smiths’ implements,— it will be my job to provide them. It
is my duty to make arrangements for each man to pursue his vocation.
I am prepared to beg on their behalf. So I ask you again to prepare
lists from which we can know how many can pursue a particular
vocation and how many members of their families can work and what
kind of work they can do. Even a sick or infirm person can do some
work. I get work out of  my widowed sister and only then do I feed
her. She says, “we are children of a Diwan”, but I do not believe
in these [distinctions]. We are only labourers in the service of
India; so I cannot but exact work from those whom I feed. I keep a
clear account with my sister and wife and so I shall even with a

There is something I have heard and which has pained me. I have heard
that some of the Kohat Hindus gamble; some, having  taken their
ration once, ask for it again and make a row if they do not get it;
if they have one quilt they ask for a second and make money by
selling it. This distresses me much. I can bear what has happened in
Kohat but if these things are true I cannot bear that. If you want to
live like this then you may return to Kohat and drown your religion.
In my view religion does not mean that one becomes a Hindu simply
because one reads the <i>Gayatri</i>. According to me, he alone is a
Hindu in whose heart the <i>Gayatri </i>is inscribed. A man does not
become a Sikh by merely reciting the <i>Granth Sahib</i>. He alone is
a true Sikh who cherishes the <i>Granth Sahib </i>in his heart with
genuine pride. One does not become an Arya Samajist because one
chants Vedic <i>mantras </i>well. But one who shapes his life in
accordance with those <i>mantras </i>is a true Arya Samajist. I will
ask Muslims also whether I become a Muslim because I read the <i>Kalama</i>.

	In a few days I shall be again in Kathiawar, and that, too, in
	Rajkot this time. Shri Bharucha has been so much impressed by
	Kathiawar that he has asked for permission to prolong his stay there
	and propagate the spinning-wheel movement . I hope that the usual
	remark about our being enthusiastic merely in the beginning will not
	be proved true in this case. If the political leaders of Rajkot
	decide, they can infuse new life in Rajkot as also in other parts of
	Kathiawar. “In other parts”, because Rajkot is the central place
	and, as it is the headquarters of the (Political) Agency also,
	political workers foregather there. No one can say that politicians
	are pressed for time, and they have sufficient influence over the
	people. They can make the whole of Kathiawar khadi-minded,
	revitalize it and check the exodus of Kathiawaris for a few pounds
	of <i>bajri</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
	We shall not understand how the problem will be solved in this way,
	by asking the question what a person can earn through the
	spinning-wheel; we shall be convinced that it can be, if we
	calculate how much money the people will save. If we only think how
	much everyone will suffer by the increase of a pie in a rupee in the
	salt tax, we shall see no reason to be seriously upset. But when we
	calculate the total revenue yielded by this impost, we shall be
	astounded by the figures. Loss of this kind is like a prick by the
	cobbler’s needle. It is felt by the society as a whole. We can
	deduce from this the effect on every individual.</p>

every home spinning brings half an anna every day. That will amount
to twelve rupees at the end of a year. And if we assume that there
are five persons in every home, then, 2,600,000 ÷ 5 = 520,000 ¥ 12
= 6,240,000, that will be the figure of rupees saved for Kathiawar.
Let us do another calculation. Assuming that for every person in the
population of 2,600,000 on the average five rupee are spent every
year on cloth, Kathiawar uses cloth worth Rs. 13,000,000. If we
deduct from this sum one-third as representing the cost of cotton,
then Kathiawar will be saving Rs. 9,000,000.</p>

What a glow of fresh life would the people of Kathiawar feel if they
found that they were exempted to the tune of nine million rupees from
the levy which they have to pay to the Bombay Government annually! If
we give up counting the benefit to each of us individually, we would
understand the invisible gains or losses in which we share. I expect
the people of Katihawar to count the collective gain or loos. If
Kathiawar does that today, the rest of India will follow suit. If we
merely ask, “What will it profit to me?” Our conclusion  will  be
absurd and ruinours. Activities beneficial to society will be
undertaken when we learn to ask: “How will this benefit the
people?” If every person thought of his own gain, all would be
ruined. When all seek the benefit of all, that is, collective
welfare, the whole society and every members of it would benefit.</p>

If the Kathiawaris think on these lines, they will realize the
miracle which the spinning-wheel can work. And I hope to receive from
them a balance—sheet drawn on these lines of work done in this
month. Did those who took the pledge to spin do the spinning every
day? Have those who did not know spinning learnt it? Has the cotton
for which an appeal was addressed to the people been collected ? If
it has been, has any plan been drawn up regarding its disposal? The
Executive Committee and the individual workers will have to answer
these and many other similar questions.</p>

I expect of Rajkot, too, a similar—balance sheet of work done.
Preparations are under way there for honouring me. What need is there
to honour me? If the people think, however, that they ought to honour
me, they can do so by raising a pile of yarn before me and by every
person adorning himself in Khadi. I can take no pleasure in
high—sounding epithets. I shall be undertaking this my second visit

I shall be opening a national school at Rajkot. I believe that
sincere workers have been giving their services for it. The Gujarat
Provincial Committee has donated liberally towards its establishment.
His Highness the Thakore Saheb has given land at a low price. I wish
that the citizens of Rajkot should take interest in this school. They
should watch it, correct any mistakes it may be making and, if it has
men of character on its staff, help it by sending their children to
it. It is but proper the Rajkot itself should shoulder the burden of
its expenses.</p>

This time my tour of Kathiawar will include a visit to Wadhawan. I
shall give a few hours to the town for the sake of the national
school there. Great sacrifices have been made for its sake. I have
heard of much criticism against it, too. Clouds have gathered over
it, and cleared. Some Khadi work has been done in the town. It is,
again, a town which claims Motilal as its citizen. It has enjoyed the
benefit of Shivlal’s enterprising spirit and wealth. I will expect
many things from this town. I am sure it will not disappoint me.</p>

I wish that, instead of wasting their time and resources on honouring
me, people at every place which I visit should think of utilizing my
services. I request the workers to see that my time and that of the
public is not wasted in useless speeches. May I claim a right to beg
that, wherever a meeting is organized as being unavoidable, every man
and woman attending it will be clad in khadi?</p>

His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore has taken up spinning. This news
cannot but gladden the hearts of those who look upon it as  a sacred
duty? The correspondent reporting this news also adds that this
development has followed Sir Prabhashanker Pattani taking up
spinning. We need not get elated on hearing of these instances. Even
so, they draw attention to the nature and extent of the power which
lies in spinning. Moreover, the example of eminent men is bound to
have an effect on the common people. I congratulate the Maharaja of
Mysore and hope that he will not give up till the end of his life
this activity which he has taken up. It will do immense good to him
and</p>

his subjects. Its immediate benefit may seem insignificant, but I
have no doubt that it will ultimately grow into an impressive giant
tree. The work of spinning will become a golden link binding the
Maharaja and his subject. This will revive the rule that princes
should engage themselves in useful work which is calculated to
benefit the subjects, the knowledge that even the work done by the
poorest among the subjects has a place in the palace of the Maharaja
will always act as an inspiration to the people, and it will be
established that in reality there is no distinction of class between
the prince and the poor. Such results do not follow from a few days’
work. They require continuous and regular work, done with complete
faith.</p>

The following letter of Dr. Sumant Mehta came into my hands only
during my recent journey to Delhi. For one thing, during tours I do
not receive my post regularly and, for another, even if letters are
received in time my secretary cannot look into them immediately.
After he has seen them, he passes on to me those needing immediate
attention, and I can look into them as and when I find time. This
naturally entails delays. Had I received Dr. Sumant Mehta’s letter
in proper time, I would have made use of it during the convocation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

The doctor proposes, and rightly, that it should be made a permanent
feature and included in the curriculum itself. The letter seems  to 
imply that the doctor intends his scheme to be adopted in place of
the present scheme of studies.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
Personally, I might like even that; there is, however, no need to
completely replace the present scheme, and even if there be, it is
not possible to do so. We had in mind the students’ inclinations
when framing it. In comparison with other provinces, Gujarat felt the
spirit of service a little late. Every student, therefore, will not
be eager for a course of studies essential for training in service.
Moreover, along with the needs of social service we have to pay
attention to the problem of livelihood. The prevailing idea is that
education is intended to equip the student with the means of
livelihood. If the aim were no more than this, it could be excused,
but there is also the idea that education should help the student to
make money or to get appointed to a position of authority. As long as
this attitude does not change, our curriculum is bound to remain
defective from a theoretical point of view. I think it impossible to
change it immediately. But it is essential, and quite possible,
gradually to reduce the idea of career to secondary importance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The Vidyapith also will have to create for the students fields of
social service which can offer them means of livelihood. Livelihood
may not be the aim of education, but the ability to earn it must be
one of the fruits of education. The aim of education is spiritual
development, and where this is achieved, the ability to make a living
is bound to follow.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It is also noted that students are not happy unless they acquire a
knowledge of English. They also crave for a knowledge of literature.
There can be no harm at all in either. We have only to guard against
making a fetish of them, against making the study of English and of
literature the sole aims of education and forms of self-indulgence.
In their right place, which they occupy at present, they are of great
value.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
It cannot be maintained that the curriculum of the Government
colleges is in every respect harmful. I do not feel that all of it
deserves to be kept out. Its features of parrot-learning, prohibition
of the use of the mother tongue, grand display of the knowledge of
English, one- sided study of history, almost complete indifference to
our ancient culture, absence of training in self-control, all these
and similar features must be guarded against.</p>

I, therefore, believe that there is considerable room for improvement
in the present curriculum of the Vidyapith. But this is sooner said
than done. Who will effect the improvement? There is none among its
workers who is rich in the experience of life. Those who are in
charge of formulating the curriculum are products of Government
colleges. Some of them may have been disillusioned about those
colleges, but how can we expect them to have a new vision and
experience of new methods? Hence the defects in the curriculum of
national education. The heads of all institutions have tried to
effect what improvements they could and their efforts have met with
some measure of success.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now a word about Dr. Sumant Mehta’s suggestion. I agree that the
programme of studies embodied in his proposal deserves to be
implemented. Some of the subjects suggested therein can be introduced
in the early stages of the course in the Mahavidyalaya. Some others
can be taught even in the pre-Mahavidyalaya stage. Yet some others
seem to be such as might be taught after the general studies are
completed. I invite Dr. Sumant Mehta to prepare his plan of study in
detail. I could have done this even by writing a letter to him. The
reason for writing about the subject here is to induce the teachers
and the students to think about it, discuss it and also help Dr.
Sumant Mehta. We have very few persons who can think. And even those
we have are busy each in his own field of work. This position is
becoming normal day by day, as is proper that it should. If everyone
were to dabble in every subject, he would do justice neither to the
subject nor to himself. Unless each one of usselects his own field of
work and works with single-minded devotion in that, we shall never
achieve our goal. The task of implementing the plan will have to be
accepted by the Doctor himself. Thoughtful teachers and social 
workers who take interest in academic matters may assist him. My role
was to bring them and him together and, to an extent, express my own
views. The doctor has retired to Petlad for one year, and he has an
opportunity there or experimenting with his scheme. It will be easy
for him, therefore, to elaborate it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
When it is fully developed, the scheme will require teachers who can
implement it, but that is a separate problem. I am sure that we shall
get them when the need for them arises.</p>

I know that the pages of this week’s <i>Young </i><i>India </i>will
 be searched for the finding of Maulana Shaukat Ali and myself on the
tragedy of last September. I am sorry to disappoint the curious. For
Maulana Shaukat Ali is not with me and I must not publish anything
without his first seeing it. I may, however, tell the reader that I
have already discussed my impressions with Pandit Motilalji, then
Pandit Malaviyaji and lastly with Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Ali and I shall hope to publish them<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3

addition, or amendment as the case may be. But apart from the
finding, I am in a position to reiterate my advice to the Hindus that
in their place I should not return to Kohat unless there is an
honourable peace with the Mussalmans without the Government
Intervention. This is not possible at the present moment. For
unfortunately, the Muslim Working Committee which is at present
guiding the Mussalmans of Kohat was not and would not be represented
before us. I can appreciate the delicate position of the Hindus. They
do not want to lose their property. The Maulana Saheb and I have
failed to bring about peace. We have failed even to draw the
principal Mussalmans for a discussion. Nor am I in a position to say
that we should succeed in our attempt in the near future. In the
circumstances the Hindus are at liberty to take any course they may
consider advisable. In spite of our failure, I can only advise one
course. “Don’t return till the Mussalmans take you to Kohat with
self-respect and dignity.” But I know that this is cold comfort
except for those who are able to stand on their own legs and are in
need of no advice from any quarter whatsoever. Such is not the
position of the Kohat refugees. I have conveyed my views to Pandit
Malaviyaji. He has been their guide from the beginning and they must
act as he advises them. Lalaji came to Pindi but he was unfortunately
laid up in bed. My own considered opinion is given in the statement</p>

But there is no hesitation about my advice regarding what the
refugees should do whilst they are outside Kohat. I cannot help
remarking that it is demoralizing for men and women  who  have strong
arms and legs and who are otherwise physically fit, to subsist on
charity. They must find out some occupation for themselves or with
the aid of the local men. I have suggested carding, spinning and even
weaving. But they may do any other useful work they choose or that
may be chosen for them. The idea is that no person, man or woman, who
is physically fit should live on charity. There must be always enough
occupation in a well-ordered State for all who are willing to work.
The refugees must be able to give a good account of every minute of
their time whilst they are being supported by the nation. “Idle
hands some mischief still will ever find to do” is not a mere
schoolboy rhyme. It contains a profound truth which can be verified
by everyone for himself. Let there be no distinction between rich and
poor, high and low. They are all bed-fellows in adver-sity. And the
rich and the well-to-do should set an example to the others by
labouring usefully even though they may not be drawing rations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
What an incalculable good it must be to a nation  whose  members know
an occupation which can stand them in good stead in distress. The
refugees’ life would have taken a nobler turn if they had all been
spinners or carders or weavers. The refugees’ camp would then have
presented the appearance of a busy hive and could have been kept up
indefinitely. If the men do not decide to return at once, it is not
yet too late to mend. It is a mistake to issue dry rations. It is no
doubt less trouble to the committee of management but it means more
waste and utter indiscipline among the refugees. They should place
themselves under soldiers, discipline keeping regular hours for
rising, washing, praying, feeding, working and retiring. There is no
reason why there should not be <i>Ramayana </i>readings or such other
readings for them. All this requires thought, care, attention and
diligence. Given these the calamity could be turned into a blessing
in disguise.</p>

I returned from Rawalpindi yesterday. Today I got your letter for
which I was waiting. I could not resist sending a telegram conveying
my thanks. Please do not be angry with the person who wrote to me. I
shall try to let you know his name also. On reading that you do not
consider any letter as wholly confidential, I have begun to feel more
proud of mankind. I feel humbled. I thought that I was perhaps the
only persons who had nothing private of confidential. You have
surpassed me, because you are living in an environment where it would
be difficult to publicize one’s private life. Had the writer been a
schemer or a wicked man, I would have written nothing to you from his
letter, nor would I have allowed it to influence me in the least. But
he is a gentleman, discrimination, disciplined  and learned. He
cannot possibly have any malice towards you; but I can well
understand how he came to commit this mistake. I am sending him a
copy of your letter. It will do him good. He is such a pure- minded
person that I wouldn’t be surprised if he came to you and offered
his apology. I did well in writing the letter to you. You recollect
your past lapses; but who is free from these? I have been saved
thrice from falling. It was not owing to my own strength but owing to
my unlettered mother. She bound her son by the thread of a vow and he
was saved.</p>

I am in the predicament of a man who having come to know that there
is a serpent under his mattress shakes the matters vigoro- usly,
sweeps the room and washes the floor with water. I have come to know
what I did not know earlier about the situation in Kohat. I talk to
you about it because it is a matter concerning religion. We all have
to take this as a warning. It does not mean that we have  to  do
something special and novel; but we have to prepare ourselves 
mentally and emotionally. We have to become purer.</p>

	crushed. But here the whole community was persecuted. Its cause must

	many things frankly about proselytization. But that activity has
	hurt me very much. I would not mind it at all if 30 crores of Hindus
	became Muslims as a result of scriptural studies and  rational
	arguments. Then I would be the single Hindu left and thereby I would
	add lustre to Hinduism. Or I would adduce proof of the immortality
	of Hinduism and say that the others became Muslims because they
	could not bear the brilliance of Hinduism. But if people turned
	Muslims out of greed or fear, as it happened there, I could not
	endure it. I am talking about this matter because I am to make you

there will be no change in my non-violent behaviour, my attitude of
love and in my behaviour towards Muslims. The more I see their
weaknesses, the more shall I serve them. My love for them will 
certainly endure. But the language of love will change—it has
become more firm and will become firmer still—just as my words to
Englishmen are becoming stiffer. That will be the only difference. My
sole object is to rouse you this morning and to caution you. I want
to caution you because you may sometimes face a similar situation. If
any little boy or girl in the Ashram is kidnapped, you should not
just look on, interpreting my non-violence in a superficial way. The
determination to be pure is itself a source of strength. A man having
a pure and unsullied heart has no need to develop his body. His body
automatically becomes strong. And thereafter mere resolve is enough.
It is my resolve that I would utter the name of Rama before retiring,
so that without chanting the name I can never get sleep. And if I do
get it, I utter <i>Ramanama </i>while turning on my side and I do see
my standing near me. The same true of every resolve.</p>

Even a child in the Ashram is not afraid if he faces danger. If he
does not have strength of soul, he surely has nails. We clip nails
becuase dirt accumulates in them. When they grow big they get in the
way and we clip them. In like manner, we should go on removing the
dangerous elements in the body one by one.</p>

part of Hinduism, I will have none of it. Even if a man has bathed
and washed off his filth, we believe that still we cannot touch
him—this attitude is sinful. The people of India are the <i>Dheds

deeds. It is not the adult of the British that we are slaves. The

the success you achieved in it were no ordinary ones. But to fight a
battle is one thing, and to follow it up with constructive work  is 
another. One discovers that to reap happy benefits from one’s
success is a difficult matter,and it often seems as if the struggle
had never been fought. To return to the normal conditions after a
struggle is as difficult as after a prolonged fast. We discovered
this even after the Kheda agitation, and feel it after the present
struggle. We saw the same thing, on a wider scale in Europe. There, a
great War was fought between Britain and Germany; colossal sacrifices
were made and we had expected to see a new Europe as a result of
these, expected to see its people more moral and pure, wiser and more
godfearing. But the evil ways which prevailed there persist even
today, and the people who made the sacrifices are in an unhappy
plight. Let us hope that the difference in the manner of fighting
that War and our struggle will be reflected in thier repsective
outcomes. In the War in Europe, the two sides fought to destroy each
other. In a satyagraha struggle, neither side is destroyed, but on
the contrary both benefit. How does it happen, then, that we do not
see the desired result at the end of even such a pure struggle as
satyagraha? The reason is just this, that we find excitement to be a
common feature of the two kinds of fighting. We are not able to
maintain an atmosphere of peace and show patience, as we should, and
so we seem to lose the gain we have made. About Borsad, however, the
Durbar Saheb had forewarned me that he would not be able to show me
Khadinagar, that the struggle had not taught</p>

Even running a school requires considerable ability. The aphorism, as
in one’s body so in the universe, holds true on all occasions. If I
can conduct the Satyagraha Ashram well, I can succeed even in Lord
Reading’s seat. The difficulties I have to face Ashram, the anxious
thought I have to bestow and the number of problems I have to solve,
I do not have to in a struggle like yours. What after all is to be
done in running a campaign? I have to chalk out a programme and tell
you what to do, merely give instructions to people; running an Ashram
is much more difficult that this. I have no aspiration to be a
Viceroy even in this life; I only wish to be a devoted servant of the
country. But I beg leave to say that running an Ashram taxes one’s
spiritual resources more agonizingly than discharging the duties of a
Viceroy ever does. You, too, I wish, should tax yourselves in like
manner in running the Vidya Mandir, or the more one suffers the purer
one becomes.</p>

crime against you if I did not say that this makes me happy. But
there is also something else which pains me. I do not know if the
organizers of the meeting deliberately made the arrangements which we
find here, but by now everyone who attends such meetings knows my
idiosyncrasies. One of these is that I am extremely paimed to see at
a meeting a separate enclosure for <i>Antyajas</i>, and find it
impossible to start my speech. But, as you have said, and many others
besides you say, non-violence is the central creed guiding my life,
and I am trying to act every moment in accordance with it. If what
you have said is true, I can never wish to give you pain. I would not

The manner in which you have framed your address and the fact of its
being printed on [hand-made] paper or, maybe khadi, can have no value
in my eyes, or only as much as you give by your daily conduct. The
address, however, which you have presented to me this moment by
removing the fencing [separating the <i>Antyajas </i>from the rest of
the audience] will ever remain inscribed in my heart. I beg for
another address like this from my Hindu sisters and brothers. I would
not be pleased by your giving me a little yarn, or offering me
flowers and fruits of various kinds and bringing an <i>Antyaja </i>girl
to place a <i>tilak </i>on my forehead (as was done here). These I
may have anywhere. But the gift you have made me just now should be

to mix with <i>Antyajas</i>, for they are also human beings. I want
that we should serve them for they deserve our service. They render
to society service which a mother gives to her child. To look upon
them as untouchables and to despise  them amounts to forgotting our
humanity. Indians have become the pariahs of the world in this age
because they look upon countless numbers of human beings as
untouchables. This has resulted in the Muslims, too, being treated as
untouchables, because of their association with us. What is the cause
of this unhappy state of affairs? There is only one answer: “Reap
as you sow” is a divine law. There is nothing mysterious in the
fact that, through the world, God is dealing us this justice. It is
perfect justice we are getting. “As men worship me, so I give  
myself   to   them”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font>so   said   Shri   Krishna.   If,   therefore,   you
understand what I want from you, you will not be pained. I am not out
to give pain to people. I am not asking too much from you. I have
never asked you to enter into marriage ties with <i>Antyajas </i>or
eat in their company. That is a matter of your own choice. But you
cannot claim that to regard them as untouchables is also a matter of
your choice. It cannot be a matter of your choice to avoid contact
where you should not and not avoid if where you should. If you do not
see the sufferings of <i>Antyajas, </i>how can you say <i>sarvam

The author of that Upanishad was not hypocrite since he has
ascertained that this entire universe in <i>Brahman; </i>we should be
worse than brutes if we do not suffer when we see others suffer. Our
dharma declares in the most emphatic terms that the brute, too, has a
soul just as we have, but we have in this age distorted the teaching
of that religion, Akha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 4pt">4

touch of another human being] as a superfluous limb. You should
discard it, cut it off. I want you to destroy this evil of
untouchability</p>

a sense of brotherhood. If we end it, we shall win glory for Hinduism

stop embracing Islam or Christianity. No religion depends for its
survival on the numerical strength of its followers. There has been
no more fallacious idea than that the strength of a religion depends
on the number of those who profess it. Even if but one person remains
a true Hindu, Hinduism will not perish; if, on the other hand, the
crores of Hindus in the country adopt the ways of hypocrisy and evil,
Hinduism will not live long but is certain to be destroyed. When I

There is no doubt that the practice of untouchability is inspired by
hatred. If anyone claims that he bears love for <i>Antyajas </i>though
treating them as untouchables, I will not believe him. I see no
evidence of love whatsoever in this practice. If we bore love for
them, we would not add-ress them insultingly, would not throw at them
our left-overs; if we had love for them, we would hold them in
reverence as we do our mothers, would provide them better wells and
schools than what we ourselves have, and permit them to visit
temples. All these would be indications of love. Love shines with the
light of countless suns. If one little sun cannot be hidden, how can
love remain so? Does a mother ever have to declare that she loves her
child? An infant which cannot even speak looks at its mother’s eyes
and, as their eyes meet, we see something mysterious passing between
them.</p>

Because I say this, let no one believe that a Hindu returned from
South Africa with reformist ideas wants to impose his ideas on
Hinduism. I can truthfully say that I entertain no ambition  of
reforming other people. I am a selfish man, immersed in my own joy. 
I seek my own spiritual welfare, and that is why I have been able to
detach myself from everything and can live in complete peace. But I
want you to feel the joy which I do and, therefore, ask you to
welcome contact with <i>Antyajas</i>, to serve them and experience
the happiness which you will get by doing so.</p>

a harsh necessity resolves to remain unmarried for her whole life and
lead a life of self-sacrifice and voluntary suffering, if, like Uma,
she takes a vow that she would marry only if she got a husband like
Siva, she is bound to get such a husband, if not in this life in the
next. Such  a woman will be an ornament to her whole community. The
purpose of marriage is not self-indulgence, but self-control. I want
all people to understand this idea.</p>

Misses Angus and Hindsley were sent from Adyar to the  Ashram by Dr.
Besant to learn carding, spinning, etc., so as to be able to train
others at Adyar. They passed a month at the Ashram and kept a diary
of their daily experiences. On their departure they left relevant
notes from their diary for publication in these pages. On first
reading I thought I could not well publish them as they appeared to
me to be too personal. The next thought was to cut out the personal
references and then publish them. But on re-reading, I have decided
to present the notes without a single alteration. I have stood the
strain of personal reference now for a long time. I can very well
bear the additional strain. There is a merit in the notes which
compels publication. The references to the Ashram are not wholly
true. All is not so rosy as it has appeared to these friends. The
Ashram has its jars, it has its trials and difficulties, it has to
wear away many a rough edge. But it does try to live up to its name.
There are certainly things about the Ashram which can be copied with
safety. But I must warn the reader against being carried away by some
of the flattering description, and applying for admission. There is a
standing notice from the Manager to me that he has more inmates than
he can take care of and more work than he can cope with. Let those 
who like  the way of the life described by Misses Angus and Hindsley
copy it wherever they may be.</p>

charkha. He does not believe in wordy battles. He personally
approaches four families every morning with his big charkha, spins
before them by way of giving first lesson and begs of them their
contributions. The process may seem futile to some, but the melodious
sound and sweet music of the charkha, preceded by the recitation of a
prayer in the early hours of the day, wonderfully conquers the
sceptic who orders a good charkha and promises due contributions.
Uncompromising unbelievers who sneered at the charkha are daily won

I do not believe that “my philosophy” is an indifferent mixture
of Tolstoy and Buddha. I do not know what it is except that it is
what I feel to be true. It sustains me. I owe much to Tolstoy and
much to Buddha. I still somehow or other fancy that “my philosophy”
represents the true meaning of the teaching of the <i>Gita</i>. I may
be totally mistaken. Such a mistake can do no harm either to me or to
anybody. For the source of my inspiration is of no consequence if
what I stand for be unadul-terated truth.</p>

Let the philosophy I represent be tested on its own merits. I hold
that the world is sick of armed rebellions. I hold too that whatever
may be true of other countries, a bloody revolution will not succeed
in India. The masses will not respond. A movement in which masses
have no active part can do no good to them. A successful bloody
revolution can only mean further misery for the masses. For it would
be still foreign rule for them. The non-violence I teach is active
non- violence of the strongest. But the weekest can partake in it
without becoming weaker. They can only be the stronger for having
been in it. The masses are far bolder today than they ever were. A
non violent struggle necessarily involves construction on a mass
scale. It cannot therefore lead to <i>tamas </i>or darkness or
inertia. It means a quickening of the national life. That movement is
still going on silently, almost imperceptibly but none the less
surely.</p>

I invite the attention of the revolutionaries to the three great
hindrances to swaraj—the incomplete spread of the spinning-wheel,
the discord between Hindus and Mussalmans and the inhuman ban upon
the suppressed classes. I ask them patiently to take their due share
in this work of patient construction. It may not be spectacular
enough. But on that very account it requires all the heroic patience,
silent and sustained effort and self-effacement of which the tallest
among the revolutionaries is capable. Impatience will blur the
revolutionary’s vision and lead him astray. Slow and inglorious
self- imposed starvation among the starving masses is every time more
heroic than the death of the scaffold under false exaltation.</p>

I have been asked to say something about <i>brahmacharya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
This is one of those subjects on which I write in <i>Navajivan </i>from
time to time. I rarely speak on it, because I think that it is an
extremely difficult subject to talk about and one cannot explain
one’s ideas about it in a speech. You wish to hear my views on
ordinary <i>brahmacharya </i>and not on <i>brahmacharya </i>in the
extended definition of the term which connotes the control of all
organs of sense. Even ordinary <i>brahmacharya </i>is said by the
Shastras to be very difficult to observe. Permit me to say that there
is ninety-nine per cent truth in this view, but that it falls short
of absolute truth by one per cent. The observance of this ordinary
<i>brahmacharya </i>is felt to be difficult because we do not strive
to control the other organs of sense. The most important of these is
the palate. For him who has learnt to  control the palate. The
observance of <i>brahmacharya </i>will be easy enough. Students of
zoology tell us that lower creatures observe <i>brahmacharya </i>better
than man. What they say is true, and if we try to know the reason we
shall discover that the lower creatures have the completest control
over the palate, which is not the result of an effort of will but is
instinctive. They feed on grass and plants, and eat only as much as
would satisfy their hunger. They eat to live, and do not live to eat.
We do quite the opposite of this. The mother feeds her child all
manner of delicacies, believing that only so can she express her
love. By acting in this way, we do not make our food more tasty, but
rather less so. Food is made tasty by appetite. A plain <i>rotla</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3

dishes so that we may be able to load our stomachs to the full, and
then we ask why we cannot observe <i>brahmacharya</i>. We let our
eyes, which God has given us for seeing things, be tainted with lust,
and do not learn to observe what we ought to. Whyshould a mother not
learn the <i>Gayatri </i>and teach it to her child? It would be
enough if, without going into its deeper meaning, she merely
understands that it is an invocation to the Sun-god and teaches the
child to worship the Sun. <i>Sanatanists </i>and Arya Samajists, both
may worship the Sun. In explaining the <i>Gayatri </i>as worship of
the Sun, I have given its most obvious meaning. What is the meaning
of this worship? It means that, holding up our heads and looking at
the Sun we should cleanse our eyes. The author of the <i>Gayatri </i>was
a <i>rishi</i>, a seer. He tells us that nowhere shall we find
anything to equal the drama of sunrise or see beauty and mystery like
its. There is no  <i>sutradhara</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>as skilled as God and no stage grander than the sky.
But which mother ever asks her child to look at the sky, for fear
that the child might hurt its eyes? Her mind is filled with all
manner of worldly thoughts; the education which they give in that big
building, she perhaps tells herself, will make her child a well-paid
officer. Does she ever ask herself, however, how much the child
benefits from what it learns, consciously or unconsiously, from the
atmosphere in the home? Parents paid their children with clothes till
they feel suffocated, try to make them look smart and handsome, but
do the children really look so? Clothes are meant to cover the body,
not to beautify it; they are meant to protect us against heat and
cold. We should ask a child shivering with cold to go and warm itself
at the stove, or sun in the street or go and work on the farm; then
alone can we help it build a body as strong as steel. Anyone who has
observed <i>brahmacharya </i>ought to have a body of such strength.
We, on the contrary, ruin children’s bodies. We wish to keep them
within the four walls of the home and make them comfortable. This
produces a kind of artificial heat in their skin which we can only
compare to eczema. We have ruined our bodies by pampering them
overmuch, we have been playing with fire.</p>

So much about clothes. Then, through the things we talk about in the
home we produce harmful effects on a child’s mind. We talk about
marrying the boy or the girl, and the things which the child sees
around it have much the same effect on its mind. What surprises me is
that we have not yet become the most uncivilized people on the earth.
Despite everything calculated to destroy decent social restraints,

Though this is our condition, we wish to oppose others with physical
force. Than are two ways in which we can make ourselves fit to do
this, a lower and a higher. The lower way is to cultivate strength of
body by any means whatever, by eating and drinking anything which may
serve our purpose, training ourselves for physical fighting, eating
beef, and so on . When I was a boy, a friend used to tell me that we
ought to eat meat, that if we did not we would never be as strong and
stout as Englishmen. The poet Narmadashanker<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>also
gave this advice in a poem of his. The lines, “The Englishman rules
and the Indian is content to submit” and “The foreigner is full
six feet tall” are intended to suggest this very idea.
Narmadashanker has rendered great service to Gujarat but there were
two phases in his life, the first of self-indulgence and the second
of self-control. This  particular poem belongs to the period of
self-indulgence. In Japan too, when they found it necessary to fight
other countries beef eating became common. If, therefore, we wish to
cultivate physical strength the lower way, we shall have to start
eating such things.</p>

But <i>brahmacharya </i>is the only means for us if we would
cultivate physcial strength the higher way. I feel pity for myself
when I hear people describing me as a man of inviolate <i>brahmacharya</i>.
I have been so described in the address presented to me. I must tell
you, therefore, that the person who drafted the address does not know
who may be called a man of inviolate <i>brahmacharya</i>. Didn’t he
 ask  himself how a man like me, married and having several
children,could be so described? A man of inviolate <i>brahmacharya
</i>would never get fever, not even so much as headache, he would
never have an attack of bronchitis or appendicitis. Doctors say that
appendicitis may even result from an orange seed sticking in the
intestines. But the seed will never be retained inside if one’s
body is clean and healthy. When the intestines have lost their tone,
they cannot eliminate such things in the natural course. My
intestines also must have lost their tone and so I might have failed
to assimilate something which I swallowed. Children often swallow
similar things, but their mothers seldom take serious notice of that.
The reason [why no harmful effects follow] is that their intestines
have the natural strength to eliminate such things. I do not,</p>

therefore, want anyone to become a hypocrite by attributing to me the
observance of inviolate <i>brahmacharya </i>[and following my
example]. The power and light of inviolate <i>brahmacharya </i>are
far greater than what I can boast of. I am not perfect in my
<i>brahmacharya</i>, though it is true that I strive to be so. I have
only placed before you a few observations from my experience which
indicate how one may erect a protecting hedge [to preserve one’s
<i>brahmacharya</i>]. Observing <i>brahmacharya </i>does not mean
that one may not touch any woman, not even one’s sister. It means
that one’s mental state must be such that touching a woman would
disturb one no more than touching a piece of paper. If, in order to
preserve my <i>brahmacharya</i>, I must guard against touching my
sister to nurse her when she is ill, that <i>brahmacharya </i>is
worth no more than the dust under our feet. We would be perfect in
our <i>brahmacharya </i>if, even when  touching  a young and
extremely beautiful woman, we are disturbed no more than when we
touch a corpse. If you wish your children to be capable of such
<i>brahmacharya</i>, you cannot prescribe their studies but should
let a man like me, imperfect though he be in his <i>brahmacharya</i>,

We must develop fearlessness at the end of a war and, by doing
constructive work, acquire the capacity to plan and execute. If we do
not have the latter, our independence cannot be preserved.  If  we
secure swaraj through non-violence, it can be preserved through
service. If we want swaraj for the sake of power it can be retained
only through violence. It is worthwhile to foster the strength of
non- violence and give up the strength that comes from power. As long
as we do not have the strength to live together, swaraj cannot be won

We can do anything in the name of religion but, when we realize that
it is <i>adharma</i>, we cannot persist in doing that. To me
untoucha- bility is more unethical than slavery. When the movement
for ending untouchability was going on here, there was a suggestion
that Christians should take part in it. But I objected to it. An
honest Christian like George Joseph<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

to enrol himself for this work in Vykom but I had said “No” to
him. If we go to the whole world for help, our work may become more
complicated.</p>

I have often acknowledged the sacrifices made by students. But it is
a universal rule admitting of no exception that the world does not
take note of the sacrifices of those who themselves proclaim their
sacrifices, for that is no sacrifice which has to be proclaimed by
the person making it. Sacrifice speaks for itself. Would it not be
better if the students thought of what they had gained, rather than
of what they had sacrificed?</p>

Anyone who does not know that national education is of value in
itself does not know what it is. <i>Snatakas </i>need not believe
that the value of the graduates of national universities has now gone
down. Why should they themeselves reduce their value by believing so?
I would expect these graduates to have full confidence in themselves.
Let them not behave as baggars without self-respect. They should have
faith in God. Do they want me to beg before the Rulers of Indian
States? Why should they not enhance their value by their own
knowledge and strength of character? We should hope for a time when
employers themselves would demand graduates of national universities.
It is for <i>snatakas </i>to hasten such a time. A diamond lying

Having said this, I beg leave of my correspondent to correct a few of
his errors. It is not true, as he believes, that a non-co-operating
student cannot suspend non-co-operation as others have done. The
painful and humiliating truth is that thousands of students who had
joined non-co-operation have returned, and more are returning, to co-
operation, that some <i>snatakas</i>, whom we had taken to be non-co-
operators, have appeared at examinations controlled by the Govern-
ment though they had obtained national diplomas. As against this,
some lawyers had their <i>sanads</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>cancelled by the courts and are forced to be among
non-co-operators. Some others, moreover, who were in Government
service and resigned their posts are truly in a pitiable condition,
but they do not feel that way and are as happy as kings, for though
enjoying the benefits of Government service they were slaves then,
and are free now though without those benefits. For this reason, they
regard themselves as fortunate.</p>

I, therefore, ask those students who are overcome with despair to see
that they have no reason to lose heart; on the contrary, they have
brighter prospects before them. Of course, this is subject to one
condition. The general impression about non-co-operating students is
that they should be upright, fearless, self-controlled, hardworking
and patriotic. Students who possess these qualities will have no
reason any time to lose heart. The salvation of the country depends
on them. They will be the foundation on which the golden temple of
the  Goddess of Freedom will be raised.</p>

I said in the last issue that I would declare open a  national school
at Rajkot. The auspicious ceremony, however, is to be performed by
the Thakore Saheb. That had always been the intention of the workers
and in case the Thakore Saheb was not available I would be there to
perform the ceremony. Having had no telegram or definite information
on this point, I assumed that I would have to do the job. I was in

keeps the public tank clean and sees to it that cattle do not wallow

incident of my childhood which happened on this very  spot  and which
I have treasured all these years. It was customary in those days, on
the occasion of a royal wedding, to send a deputation to bridal
States, before the wedding took place. The sons of the minister would
form part of the deputation. My father who was then minister,
however, had made it a point never to send his boys on  such 
occasions. At the time which I am recalling today, deputations were
to go to Kanpur and Dharampur. My father, of course, kept us back. My
good mother, who was more worldly and did not want her children to be
robbed of the prizes of position, pressed my brother and me to go to
the late Thakore Saheb and cry before him. When he asked us what we
were after, we were to tell him that we wanted to go to Dharampur. We
followed the advice and we were sent not to Dharamapur but Kanpur.
Today also I must cry to conquer. I shall cry not for name and fame
or wealth and position. Fame, said the <i>shastris</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt"><i>1
</i></font></sup>who blessed me, was ever a virgin inasmuch as she
failed to find a suitable match for her, and they wished that that
coy damsel should at last wed with me. May she ever remain “in
single blessedness”. For I am sure that were she to marry me I
would be undone. I cry not, therefore, for fame, but one or two
things you have withheld from me.</p>

more for the kinder sentiment expressed by the Thakore Saheb. I wish
I was worthy of them. I do not for a moment flatter myself with the

people and want to continue as such. Let me pray that I may remain

A very thoughtful Mussalman once told me that so long as there was
untouchability in Hinduism it was difficult for Mussalmans to
entertain any regard for that faith or its followers. I have repeated
times without number that an “untouchable” community is unknown
to the Shastras. The weaver and the scavenger are not classed as
untouchables by the Shastras. I am both. My mother was certainly a
scavenger inasmuch as she cleaned me when I was a child. But she did
not, on that account, become an untouchable. Why then should a
<i>Bhangi</i>, who renders similar necessary service, be regarded as
untouchable? Even if the whole world of <i>shastris </i>were to be
against me I would proclaim from the housetops that they are wrong in
considering untouchability to be part of the Hindu religion.</p>

And in this connection I take leave to mention one thing that both
pleased and pained me . I was glad to notice that the <i>shastris’
</i>blessings was the first item of today’s programme. But I
wondered whether there was a false ring about them. Their praise
meant endorsement of my work on untouchability. Did they approve of
my activity about it or did they merely obey the presumed or declared
will of the Thakore Saheb that they should bless me? The benediction
rang untrue because of the omission in your address of my campaign
against untouchability. I beseech you, Thakore Saheb, to be kind to
them, to befriend the depressed people of your State, even as Rama of
old befriended Shabari and Guha, both presumably untouchables. I ask
you to ensure them admission into schools, temples and all public
places.</p>

I was distressed to find the boy scouts clad in foreign khaki. I did
expect that these at least would be clad in khaddar. If you have
khaddar uniforms for your boy scouts and your Police  you  can
relieve the misery of the poor, the untouchables and the indigent
widow. I entreat you, therefore, Thakore Saheb and members of the

sword’s edge, you may not depart by even a hair’s breadth from
the straight and narrow path of truth. It is an eternal reminder of
the fact that in your state there should be not a single drunkard,
and no impure man or woman. It is your duty to put strength where
there is weakness and cleanliness where there is dirt. Befriend the
poor and the oppressed. Your sword is not meant for others’ necks,
it is meant for your own. You can tell your people that the moment
you exceed the bounds of your authority they may put you to the
sword. I speak in these terms to you as I owe a duty to you, Thakore
Saheb. Your father made my father an unconditional gift of some land.
I have thus eaten your salt and I should not be worth the salt, if I
did not on this solemn occasion invite your attention to what are a
prince’s obvious duties. The honour you have done me lays me under
a deep debt of gratitude. I prize the relief of the poor and the
oppressed and the untouchables more than all that honour. Tell me
that you have introduced numerous spinning-wheels in your villages
and schools, that you have introduced khaddar in all your
departments, and that all your public institutions and places are
thrown open to the untoucha- bles, and I shall feel doubly honoured
and in reverence bow down my head to you. May God bless you with
strength to serve your people.</p>

This school, or rather the Vidyapith from which it has sprung, is a
part of the great experiment which is at present being conducted in
the country. Durbars and Indian States rarely undertake an exper-
iment of this kind. Their general inclination is to follow the royal
path. We shall hardly find any State which would think of abandoning
this path and venturing upon experiments. It is for the people, not
their rulers, to undertake experiments. Rulers are the protectors and
representatives of their subjects. If I may go further, I would say
that a real king is the servant of his subjects. He cannot,
therefore, conduct experiments at their cost. From that point of
view, the Thakore Saheb was right in what he said regarding teachers,
but people like me who have spent their whole lives in making
experiments cannot follow any other course. I would, therefore, pray
to the Thakore Saheb to look kindly on us. If the rules intended for
the teachers of a country which aspires to be free, that is, to be
self-controlled, are not very strict, we shall find it difficult to
get teachers of even moderate quality for the ordinary schools.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
I would tell the teachers that they should always be ready to face
difficulties, and should follow the path of dharma till the very end.
No matter if the number of students goes down from 150 to 40, they
should continue to serve the school. It is their faith which will
give a magnetic quality to the school and attract more students in
the future. It is said that we are always brave in the beginning,
but, when difficulties come, instead of praying to the God of mercy
we abandon the task, the egotists that we are. If we examine the
history of nations, we shall see that among people who enjoy freedom
there have been countless men and women who had remained loyal to
their principles at the cost of their lives. It does not matter if
the school makes no progress, not merely for five years but for
twenty years. In the history of a school twenty years mean nothing.
Whether or no we see any tangible results, if the teachers have faith
in themselves they should follow what seems to them the most
straightforward path; they are bound, in the end, to see the coast.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
It is necessary to say a few words about the distinctive features of
this school. One is that it has decided to admit <i>Antyajas </i>in
the face</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 5%"><br/>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
of many difficulties, and another that it has given the highest
importance to bodily labour. Its teachers and pupils have had a share
in the labour behind the greenery we see on its grounds. Such bodily
labour is a form of <i>yajna</i>. In his age, however, the best <i>yajna
</i>for this country consists in spinning. Every man and woman should
give half an hour daily to the spinning-wheel for the sake of the
country, for the sake of the <i>Antyajas, </i>of the countless poor
and the numberless widows. The parents should realize that their
children ought to  cultivate not only their intellect but also their
bodies, should learn not merely to serve their own interests but also
to work for public good. Those who see that the spinning-wheel
advances public good, will never abandon it. I hear, on the contrary,
that parents do not like their children to do bodily work, they do
not like them to spin. True knowledge consists in a harmonious
development of the body, the intellect and the soul. Our highest
welfare lies in cultivating all the three. Ours is a country in which
even self-sacrificing and hard- working teachers will lose heart. I
pray to the Thakore Saheb that he should look kindly on teachers
living in such an atmosphere.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
Does the school violate any moral principles? If it does, the
position of course would be different. Maybe some will think that the
issue of untouchability involves a moral principle; those parents who
think that contact with <i>Antyajas </i>defiles us need not send
their children to this school. I will then pray to God to open my
eyes if I was in the wrong, or to vouchsafe that the parents should
give up their obstinacy if they are in the wrong.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 95%">
I shall say in conclusion that this school will  not  prosper through
the sympathetic interest of the Thakore Saheb or through the efforts
of the parents, nor will it prosper because of my efforts or
Vallabhbhai’s or through the promise of help by the none too
flourishing Vidyapith. Everything will depend on the teachers. I do
not believe that money alone can help any institution. If it could,
the Hardinge School in Calcutta would not have had to be closed. It
did not succeed because it did not get sincere workers to breathe
life into it, such as an institution of its kind requires. You should
aspire to give life to this school and should start work with God’s
name on your lips. Those who regard themselves as weak as women and
work with God’s name of their lips, who turnto God with Draupadi’s
piteous cry<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The Thakore Saheb expounded fine ideas about education, but was
pessimistic about being able to put them into effect in a small State
like this. But there is no justification for his pessimism. In fact a
State enjoys many advantages in being small. The people of Rajkot are
such that it should be easy to win their co-operation. The smaller
countries of Europe, like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland—countries
about which the world has not heard much because they were not
involved in the last War—boast a civilization in no way inferior to
that of the bigger coun-tries; they have carried out many successful
experiments in the field of education. The problems of big countries
are also big. I can well understand what difficulties a person in the
position of Lord Reading generally has to contend with. With so many
parties and interests to consider, and the field of work so large,
what effective work can be done? It is, therefore, only in small
countries that promising plans can be easily implemented. The Gujarat
Vidy- apith has been, in a way, doing what the Thakore Saheb
explained. If we run one model institution with ideal students, many
more institu- tions of the same kind will grow out of it. A  zero 
can  produce nothing, for it cannot be multiplied, whereas one can
grow into many. There is, therefore, no cause for despair. The cause
of despair  generally lies in the man himself. The <i>atman </i>is
its own friend and its own enemy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>We
may not put any limits to what human effort can achieve. There can be
any such limits only if we can see above us any obstruction to upward
flight. For rising the sky is the only limit. There is a limit to how
low we can fall. God Himself has created such limit in the form of
land, rock, water, etc. Hence we need not despair. I advise the
people to take the fullest advantage of the Ruler, and should like to
say to the latter that he has done much, but much more needs to be
done.</p>

The Ruler and the subjects should develop the  completest  mutual
understanding and confidence. If it is true to say “As the Ruler,
so the subjects”, it is equally true to say “As the subjects, so
the Ruler”. If you yourselves do nothing, however much the Ruler
may wish to help, he, too, can do nothing. If you let hypocrisy,
flattery and wickedness govern your lives, the Ruler’s life is
bound to mirror those evils. I have to mention this because the
saying, “Salt is better even than honey”, is still true.</p>

It is a good letter because it is a frank letter. I am unable to
congratulate the Travancore Government, if the facts are as stated.
But  I do not know them. I therefore suspend my judgment till I know
them first hand . I am eager to visit Vykom at the earliest possible
date. I hope that it will not be long.</p>

Meanwhile, satyagrahis must not be dejected. They dare not give way
to despair. Of all my Tamil lessons one proverb at least abides with
me as an evergreen. Its literal meaning is, “God is the only Help
for the helpless”. The grand theory of satyagraha is built upon a
belief in that truth. Hindu religious literature, indeed all
religious literature, is full of illustrations to prove the truth.
The Travancore Durbar may have failed them. I may fail them. But God
will never fail them, if they have faith in Him. Let them know that
they are leaning on a broken reed if they are relying on me. I am
living at a safe distance from them. I may wipe their tears, but
suffering is their sole privilege. And victory will surely come out
of their sufferings provided they are pure. God tries His votaries
through and through, but never beyond endurance. He gives them
strength enough to go through the ordeal He prescribes for them. For
the satyagrahis of Vykom their satyagraha is not a mere experiment to
be given up if it does not succeed within a prescribed time or after
a prescribed force</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
of suffering. There is no time limit for a satyagrahi nor is there a
limit to his capacity for suffering. Hence there is no such thing as
defeat in satyagraha. Their so-called defeat may be the dawn of
victory. It may be the agony of birth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The Vykom satyagrahis are fighting a battle of no less consequence
than that of swaraj. They are fighting against an age long wrong and
prejudice. It is supported by orthodoxy, superstition, custom and
authority. Theirs is only one among the many battles that must be
fought in the holy war against irreligion masquerading as religion,
ignorance appearing in the guise of learning. If their battle is to
be bloodless, they must be patient under the severest trials. They
must not quail before a raging fire.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The Congress Committee may give them no help. They may get no
pecuniary help, they may have to starve. Their faith must shine
through all these dark trials.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Theirs is “direct action”. They dare not be irritated  against
their opponents. They know no better. They are not all dishonest men
as satyagrahis are not all honest men. They are resisting what they
honestly believe to be an encroachment upon their religion. The Vykom
satyagraha is the argument of suffering. The hardest heart and the
grossest ignorance must disappear before the rising sun of suffering
without anger and without malice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I am alarmed at the appearance of small-pox in the satyagraha camp.
It is a disease born of filth and yields to hygienic treatment. They
must isolate small-pox patients and discover the cause of the
disease. Is their camp in a perfectly sanitary condition? Doctors
have no medicine for small-pox. Water cure is the best cure. Low diet
or no diet is the safest. Let the patients have copious draughts of
pure water. Above all neither the patients nor the others should lose
nerve. The disease is also a course of suffering. Soldiers’ camps
are not free from disease. Indeed it has been ascertained that more
soldiers  die  of  disease than of bullet wounds.</p>

For finance, they need not worry. Their faith will bring them all the
pecuniary aid they may need. I know of no good cause that has died
for want of funds.</p>

The italics and the black types are the writer’s. I have given the
letter for its undoubted earnestness. And yet to me, an ob- server
untouched, I hope, by any bias one way or the other, the reasoning
appears to be specious when it is used to demonstrate that the
Mussalmans are not a minority in India. The writer forgets that the
claim is that of all Mussalmans against all Hindus. The latter cannot</p>

both have the cake and eat it. Though divided among themselves, the
Hindus do present a more or less united front not only to the Mus-
salmans but to all non-Hindus, even as the  Mussalmans  though
divided among themselves present naturally a united front to all non-
Muslims. We shall never solve the question by ignoring facts or re-
arranging them to suit our plans. The facts are that the Mussalmans
are seven crores against twenty-two crores of Hindus. The latter have
never denied it. Let us also know the issues. A minority does not
always fear a majority be-cause it is a majority. The Mussalmans fear
the Hindu majority because the Hindus, they say, have not always
treated them with justice, have not respected their religious
prejudices and because, they say, the Hindus are superior to them in
education and wealth. Whether these are facts or not is irrelevant
for our purpose. It is enough that Mussalmans believe them and
therefore are afraid of the Hindu majority. The Mussalmans expect to
meet this fear only partially be means of separate electorates and
special represen- tation even in excess of their number in some
cases. The Hindus admit the Mussalman minority but deny the Mussalman
charge of injustice. This must therefore be verifed. I have not known
Hindus to deny the statement that they are superior to Mussalmans in
education and wealth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 102%">
The Hindus on their part fear the Mussalmans because they (the
Hindus) say that Mussalmans whenever they have held power have
treated them with great harshness and contend that though they were
in a majority they were non-plussed by a handful of Mussalman
invaders, that the danger of a repetition of the experience is ever
present before the Hindus, and that in spite of the sincerity of the
leading Mussalmans the Mussalman masses are bound to make common
cause with any Mussalman adventurer. The Hindus therefore reject the
plea of weakness on the part of the Mussalmans and refuse to
entertain the idea of extending the doctrine of the Lucknow Pact. It
is again beside the question whether the Hindu fear is justified. The
fear is a fact to be reckoned with. It would be wrong to  impute 
motives to any community or leaders. To distrust Malaviyaji or Mian
Fazl-i-Hussain is to postpone a proper solution. Both honestly state
what they feel. Wisdom lies therefore in brushing aside all side
issues and facing the situation as it is, not as we would like it to
be.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
In my opinion therefore the writer has tried, be it ever so
unconsciously, to overprove his case. He is right in saying that
Hindus</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
are divided into many antagonistic sects or parties each setting up a
claim or separate treatment. He is right also in stating that the
untouchables have even stronger case than the Mussalmans for separate
representation. The writer has made out a case not against the fact
of Mussalman minority but against communal representation and
separate electorates. He has shown that any extension of the doctrine
of the Lucknow Pact must inevitably lead to communal representation
for innumerable sub-castes and other denominations, thus indefinitely
postponing the early advent of swaraj.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
To extend the Lucknow Pact doctrine or even to retain it is fraught
with danger. To ignore the Mussalman grievance as if it was not felt
is also to postpone swaraj. Lovers of swaraj cannot therefore rest
till a solution is found which would allay Mussalman apprehen- sions
and yet not endanger swaraj. Such a solution is not impossible.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; margin-top: 0.03cm">Here
is one.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In my opinion the Mussalman claim for majority in Bengal and the
Punjab in accordance with their numbers is irresistible. That claim
cannot be resisted for the fear from the north or the North West.
Hindus, if they want swaraj, must take the chance. So long as we fear
the outside world, we must cease to think of swaraj. But swaraj we
must have. I would therefore rule out the Hindu fear in considering
the just claim of the Mussalmans. We must dare to do justice even at
the cost of future safety.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
What the Mussalmans want is not separate electorate for its own sake
but they want their own real representatives to be sent to the
legislatures and other elective bodies. This can be done by private
arrangement rather than legal imposition. There is flexibility about
private arrangement. A legal imposition tends to become more and more
rigid. Private arrangement will continually test the honour and good
faith of each party. Legal imposition avoids the necessity of honour
or good faith. Private arrangement means a domestic settle- ment of
domestic quarrels and a solid wall of united  opposition against a
common enemy—the foreign rule. I am told that the law prevents the
working of the private arrangement I have in view. If it is so, we
must seek to remove the legal obstacle and not create and add a new
one. My plan therefore is to do away with separate electorates but
secure the elec-tion of the desired and agreed number of Mussalman
and other candidates in a given constituency under a joint ticket,
Mussalman candidates o be nominated by previously known Mussal-</p>

man associations. I need not enter into the question of
representation in excess of numbers at the present stage. It can be
considered and all difficulties in that direction can be met when the
principle of private arrangement is accepted by all.</p>

No doubt my proposal presupposes a sincere desire on the part of all
concerned to reach a solution in terms of swaraj. If communalism is
the goal, then any private arrangement must break down. If, however,
swaraj is the goal and the parties approach the question purely from
a national standpoint, there need be no fear of a break-down. On the
contrary every party will be interested in its  faithful working.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
What the law should, however, provide is a just franchise whereby
every community can have, if it wished, voters on the roll in
proportion to its numbers. Our voters’ rolls should answer the
number of representatives in proportion to its population. But that
question requires a critical examination of the working of the
existing franchise. For me the existing franchise is wholly untenable
for any swaraj scheme.</p>

It will be remembered that many workers made promises at Belgaum just
after the close of the session as to the number of self- spin-ning
members they would register before the 1st March next. That day is
soon coming upon us. I have before me the list  of promised members.
I hope the makers of these promises will prove as good as their word.

resolved upon securing far more than the figures promised at Belgaum.
I would like the Provincial Secretaries, if they kindly will, to
telegraph to <i>Young India </i>the numbers of self-spinning and
other members registered at the end of the month. Workers everywhere
are finding the task of securing voluntary spinners far more
difficult than getting four-anna members. To me the value of the
spinning franchise consists in its dificulty due not to want of
ability but want of application. For let it be noted that the
difficulty is confined not merely to unbelievers, it is applicable
also to believers. They readily make promises but equally if not more
readily break them. Witness the falling off in spinning during the
month of December. I hope therefore that there will be ceaseless
effort on the part of those who made promises.</p>

Some friends have suggested that the time for sending in the prize
eassay on hand-spinning and khaddar should be extended. One friend
suggests the extension to as late as November. If I did so, it would
defeat the purpose for which the essay is required. Mr. Revashanker
has issued the prize with a view to stimulate thought and activity on
the message of the spinning-wheel during this year of grace which is
fast running out. The idea moreover of allowing a brief period is to
concentrate the energy of the few searchers we have on the subject
and to make it worthwhile even from a pecuniary standpoint for those
khaddar students who may be in need, to devote their whole attention
during the period to the essay. I do not expect an exhaustive
treatise, but I do expect a classical introductory essay on the
subject so as to serve as an infallible guide for more elaborate
work. It should give an exhaustive bibliography on the subject and a
scientific, brief, relevant, connected, summary of them.</p>

There are many who question the facts often set forth in these

doubt the ability of the wheel to compete with the mills. Others
regard it as a mere toy incapable even of producing an effect on the

statistics and argument in support of the value of the wheel unless

Another suggestion comes from another friend. He thinks that the
examiners should include one or more mill-owners, such as Messrs
Ambalal Sarabhai and Matubhai Kantawala. The names of examiners were
selected by me and I must confess that the omission of a mill-
owner’s name was deliberate. I felt that the examiners to be just
to the subject should be believers in khaddar but open to reason and
able to judge. My correspondent, however, suggests that even experts
like Mr. Maganlal Gandhi are likely to make mistakes for their want
of an intimate knowledge of the mill industry. I recognize the force
of the objection and will therefore gladly put myself in
correspondence with the gentlemen concerned and seek their
co-operation in the examination.</p>

wells for them will perpetuate the evil. It will take a long time to
root out the effects of untouchability. It would be wrong to withhold
help from the untouchables in the shape of providing them with
separate wells for fear of others never letting them use public

many people will use them. Reform among the untouchables must proceed

As an ex-prisoner it is pleasant to compare notes with fellow
prisoners. Acharya Gidwani is not alone in developing dislike of tea
in his prison. I was myself a regular drinker of tea and coffee. But
my first experience cured me of the habit. There was no tea allowed,
and I began to like the idea of being free from the slavery of tea.
For us in India it is a luxury we can ill-afford. But the worst of
tea is that it replaces milk. Tea has only as much nutritive value as
there are milk and sugar in it. The way we prepare tea in India
counteracts the effect of milk and sugar because of the boiling of
the leaves which sets free the injurious tanin contained in the leaf.
If tea is to be drunk at all the leaves should never be boiled but
they should be put in a strainer and boiling water poured gently over
them. The water that thus trickles down into the kettle should be
straw colour. But the safest thing to do is to follow Acharya
Gidwani’s prescription and to give up tea altogether. Those who
want simply to drink, but not eat, may take boiling water with sugar
and milk and add a little cinnamon powder to give the water a
colouring. Acharya Gidwani’s remarks on Muller’s system will be
read with interest. In my opinion the Acharya shares the weakness of
new converts. All these systems promise much more than they can
perform. There is nothing new in Muller’s system. It is an
indifferent and incomplete reproduction of some of the <i>Hatha Yoga</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>practices.
Considered purely from a health point of view  <i>Hatha </i><i>Yoga
</i>practices are almost perfect. Only they share with everything
Indian the disabilities of their origin. The secret consists in deep
and well-regulated breathing and gently tretching the muscles. Muller
attracts us because he has given physical reasons for the exercises
he prescribes. His system has its use, no doubt, in that those who
will not take the trouble to understand the intricacies of <i>Hatha
Yoga </i>exercises can certainly profit by following the easy
instructions prepared by Muller. What is more, we have not many
accessible representatives of <i>Hatha Yoga </i>and the few there are
naturally and rightly do not trouble about its physical consequences
and therefore teach them only to those who are spiritually minded.</p>

Since my return from Pindi I have visited nearly ten villages of
Borsad taluk. It is a taluk of the successful and glorious satyagraha
of 1923 under Mr. Vallabhbhai Patel’s leadership. It contains an
intelligent, able and comparatively hard population. But even in this
taluk I was pained to find in some villages squalor and degradation
that were due purely to poverty. The crops were damaged by a severe
frost. In certain villages the people were in constant danger of
having their fields raided by cattle lot loose upon them at the
instance practically of the principal landowner. It was not possible
for them to feel settled in life or feel that they had a home of
their own which they could take pride in. The result was despair and
consequent indifference to effort. There was nothing but the charkha
for such people. But even the charkha makes slow headway. They do not
want to do anything. They want merely to eke out a living somehow.
“We have gone on like this for years, let us close our lives like
this”, is the reply written in their blank and incredulous looks.
It is the same thing to them even if one presented them with some
other industry. They do not want to <i>work </i>because they have
hither- to <i>slaved</i>. And having only done that, they believe in
<i>slaving </i>but not in <i>working </i>. This is a sad discovery
not made by me for the first time. It was the same thing in
Champaran, worse in Orissa. But it came upon me in Borsad taluk with 
a strange and overwhelming force. I was ill-prepared for the
discovery in this taluk. On the contrary I had expected to find
well-ordered villages where I would see enthusiasm and brightness and
hope. Not that all the villages were alike. Although they are so near
one another, each has problems of its own and each has a distinct
individually. For the villages I have described, the spinning-wheel
is the only hope, if there is any. Cattle cannot raid it. Frost
cannot bite it. It is man’s protection against cruel nature’s
ravages and some protection against man’s depradations.</p>

Ample work awaits those patriotic young men who do not mind the
village life and who can derive pleasure from silent and sustained
labour, not too taxing and yet taxing enough for its monotony. It
requires sufficient application to be able to appreciate the monotony
of life-giving industry. A beginner of music knows the dullness of
the initial effort but the very monotony becomes a pleasure as soon
as he has mastered the art. So it is with the village workers. As
soon as they</p>

have lived down the excitement of the intoxicating town life  and
settled down to work, the monotony of labour will give strength and
hope because it is productive. Who is ever jaded by the monotonous
and unfailing regularity with which the solar system works. Though as
ancient as time, it has never ceased to excite wonder and praise. We
know, too, that a disturbance in the even tenor of its working means
destruction of our race. So it is with the village solar system whose
centre is the wheel.</p>

to do so? I have said at so many places that I have no provision for
the safe custody of articles of silver and other valuables. To make
such provision is to invite trouble. I have been able to preserve my
freedom only because I have refused to possess such articles. I have
been, therefore, telling the country that those who wish to follow

But, while on the one hand I offer compliments to you, on the other I
pity myself for my avarice. My appetite is more than can be satisfied
by this piece of paper. A sum of two hundred and one rupees is not
good enough for me. I say this because I can assure you that you will
get from me twice as much as what I take from you or even more. I do
not receive a single pice which does not grow into a veritable tree
raining coins—not through interest but through the manner of its
use. It would be much better to perish than to live on interest. I
put every pice to the best possible use and profit. I will use every
pice I receive to help the country to preserve its purity and to
clothe its naked. Every pie, more-over, will be accounted for. I have
not come into contact with any person whom I might have told that he
had given me enough. This is why my Memon friends always keep away
from me. Were it not so, persons like Omar Haji Amod Zaveri<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>would be present in this meeting. They tell me that
wherever I meet them I try to rob them. It is, thus, very risky to be
a friend of mine in these hard times. Only such persons who, being
Hindus, are ready to offer their money freely for the service of the
<i>Bhangis</i>, or are ready to use all their strength and their
money to win the country’s freedom— only such persons can afford
to be my friends in these hard times. The Thakore Saheb of Rajkot
showered his love on me so much that I was almost drowned in the
flood. But all the time I was trembling, wondering how long I would
be able to retain his friendship. Why should I not feel happy at
receiving an address from the hands of the Ruler of a State in which
my father was a Diwan? My grandfather was the Diwan of the State
during the rule of the present Maharana’s grandfather, and my great
grandfather was Diwan to the latter’s  father. The Rana Saheb’s
father was my friend and client. Having</p>

received material benefit from him, is it possible that I would also
not be pleased by an invitation from the present Maharana Saheb? But
it is difficult to retain all friendships, for instance, I have not
been able to retain that of the British. The reason is that I think
it necessary to preserve only one friendship in this life, namely,
God’s. God means the voice of conscience. If I hear it say that I
must sacrifice  the world’s friendship; I would be ready to do so.
I am eager for your friendship and would not feel satisfied even if I
could take away all your money. I will always ask you for more and,
should you send me away, I would seek a place in God’s house. My
field of work is India. So long as a fire is raging in the country, I
cannot possibly think of leaving it to go anywhere else. South Africa
would welcome me, but at present I would not like to go even there as
the fire in Sourth Africa can be put out only when the fire in India
has been put out. I have been appealing to all Princes for help in
extinguishing that fire. Is it unreasonable of me to expect most from
Porbunder in this matter?</p>

I expect similar help from the people too. I ask for co-operation
from you all. If you give it, the result may be that all of us will
resume co-operation with the British. I do not mean that we shall go
running to them; rather, they will come running to us. They tell me
that I am a good man, but that my co-workers are rogues, that
incidents like the one at Chauri Chaura will betray me. But I believe
in human nature. Evreyone has a soul and can exercise soul-force as
much as I. You can see the soul-force in me because I have ever kept
my soul wide awake by humbly entreating it, or beating a drum or
dancing before it. Yours may not be equally awake, but we are all
equal in our innate capacities. The Rulers and their subjects, Hindus
and Muslims, all are fighting one another but without God’s help
they cannot move even a blade of grass. If the subjects think that
they will cultivate strength and harass the Rulers and the latter
think that they can be strong enough to crush the subjects, if Hindus
believe that it is no difficult matter for them to crush seven crores
of Muslims and the latter think that they can easily crush the
twenty-two crores of Hindus nourished on no strength-giving food,
then the Rulers and the subjects, Hindus and Muslims, all are

likewise, did not bind hu-man beings to one another, we would all be
dead. We should, therefore, have such a chain to bind us if we want
swaraj or <i>Ramarajya</i>. That chain of love is no thing but the
thread of hand- spun yarn. If the yarn is foreign, it would only
serve as iron shackles on your feet. Your links should be with your
villages, with the <i>Rabaris </i>and with the <i>Mers </i>of Barda.
If, instead, you have your links with Lancashire or Ahmedabad, of
what profit will that be to Porbunder? What the people really want is
that we should have some use for their labour, that we should not
force them to remain idle and so starve them. Is it right that
instead of getting stone from  Ranavav,  you should order your
requirements from Italy? How can you afford to order your cloth or
ghee from Calcutta in preference to the cloth woven in your own
villages and the ghee made from the milk of your own cows and
buffaloes? If you do not use your own products but order your needs
from elsewhere, I would say that you were chained with fetters. I
have been a free man ever since I discovered this sacred principle of
complete swadeshi and understood that my life should have a link with
the poorest among the poor. Neither the Rana Saheb nor Lord Reading
nor even King George can deprive me of my happiness.</p>

temples. I want to know from you whether you will listen to me only

Someone asked me what I hoped to gain by  accepting an address in
Porbunder, and advised me to ascertain first what class of persons
here wear khadi. Instead of asking what class of persons wear khadi,
I may ask whether anyone at all does so. You like to wear fine cloth.
Some rich millionaires told me that even they could not afford to
wear such cloth always. You will, however, get fine cloth to wear if
you spin fine yarn with the same care with which you prepare thin</p>

So long as this problem of yarn is not solved, you will not be able
to forge the chain of love with which to bind people together. If you
wish to bind the whole world with such a chain, there is, assuredly,
no way but this; nor is there any other way of bringing about Hindu-
Muslim unity. When I went to Rajkot, I was accompanied by Shri Shuaib
Qureshi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. The local Muslims told him that I was deceiving him,
that in asking the people to propagate khadi my motive was to ruin
Muslim merchants. But Shuaib is not a man who can be misled in this
manner. He knows that I would never concern myself about the  handful
of merchants engaged in the foreign cloth trade. He himself is a
lover of khadi, and he knows that I have not been able to serve the
cause of khadi or the country as well as I have served Islam. Our
Muslim brethren should know that India is the land of their birth,
and that they cannot hope to free the Islamic countries without 
first securing India’s freedom.</p>

This may turn out to be my last tour of Kathiawar. Perhaps I have
only a few years to live. It was with the utmost reluctance that I
accepted the Presidentship of the Congress, and also of the Kathiawar
Political Conference. Only ten months remain now. I have, therefore,
come here to tell you that if you look upon me more especially as
your brother—though I regard myself as a brother of all living

dharma. The essence of Hinduism does not lie in the practice of

coercion, this evil would have disappeared from the country long ago.
I have heard that many sea-men in Porbunder have given up drinking,
and also that the Rana Saheb approves of this movement and is ready
to help. We cannot hope to be free till we are free from the evil of
drink. The methods adopted in Europe for winning freedom will not
help us. There is a world of difference between the temper of the
people in Europe and the climate there, on the one hand, and on the
other, the temper of our people and our climate.  The  people  of
Europe can harden their hearts against pity, our people cannot.
Muslims of other countries tell me that Muslims of India are
comparatively of a mild temper. Whether this is a good thing or not,
only the Hindus and the Muslims, or the world, can say. Personally, I
feel that we stand to lose nothing by their being mild. Being
compassionate does not mean being timid or forsaking the use of arms;
the really strong man is he who, though armed, does not strike the
enemy but stands before him boldly, ready to be killed. It is the
ruling principle of a brave man’s life, and the essence of the
Kshatriya spirit, that he never abandons his post of duty, never
turns back. It is necessary for anyone who wants to cultivate these
qualities to give up the use of intoxicants. I, therefore, would be
happy to hear that the people of Porbunder had totally given up
drinking. In Rajkot, the evil is spreading wide. The shopkeepers are
competing with those in the civil station, with the result that
liquor is sold at the same price as soda. But those who get liquor
thus cheap shed tears of blood afterwards. Workers’ wives come and
ask me if I cannot persuade the Thakore Saheb [to close the
liquor-booths]. The evil of drinking, they tell me, has ruined their
homes and introduced discord in their families; their husbands have
taken to immoral ways and their homes are sinking into poverty. If we
want to earn the blessings of these poor women, we shall have to take
courage in our hands in asking the Rulers to save the people from
this terror. That the drink-trade is a source of income to the State
or that drinking makes people happy for a while should be no
consideration with them. If the evil spreads, the condition of the
country will become so frightful that it will automatically perish;
no one will have to try to destroy it. May God bless you and give you
the good sense to listen to my words and understand what I say, so
that the entire world may benefit through you.</p>

I am very happy to see you all. I feel great happiness in meeting the
<i>Antyajas </i>who have come here—the term denoting <i>Dheds,
</i><i>Bhangis </i>and <i>Chamar</i><i>s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>who are mistakenly treated as outcastes. You know that
caste Hindus do not come into contact with <i>Antyajas</i>. They
believe that they can offer to <i>Antyajas </i>the food left over by
others. Thus all manner of injustice is done to them. Many amongst
the Hindus are trying hard to set this right. In the Congress
important discussions are going on and great efforts made [to end
this].</p>

But they cannot do much by themselves. Your help too is needed. Many
Hindus tell me: “You take their side; but you should see for
yourself how these people live. They eat carrion and they do not
bathe or wash. One feels nausea at the sight. They have dirty habits.
How then can we touch them?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
There is some truth in this. The truth is worth listening to. You
should give up whatever is bad in you and should help in reforming
yourselves. Even God does not help those who do not help themselves.
So it is I tell you to help yourselves. Wash your face at dawn at
four o’clock, clean your eyes of mucus, and pray to God. If you ask
me how to do this, I would beg you to take the name of Rama. Krishna
or Karsan, or whatever name we call Him by, signifies the same Being.
But the name Rama is easiest of all. We must beg of Him, “Oh God,
make us good”! Bathing once in several days is not good. You should
bathe daily. Labourers should bathe at night after their work. You
should not steal. You should keep your children clean. It is your
fault if they are not clean. What can the poor school teacher do? The
third thing is not to drink liquor. The man who drinks becomes Satan.
You should not eat carrion,—in fact you should avoid meat. Won’t
it do if you get only <i>roti </i>and milk? Those who know how to
weave should keep up weaving. I can put up with it if you do not
spin, but not with bad habits.</p>

covers the problems of <i>Antyajas. </i>This problem has created

embrace the <i>Antyajas </i>if we want to make khadi every man’s

organization among weavers. I have just come from Wankaner; there are
three hundred Muslim weavers there whose work is beautiful. But there
are only two or three who weave hand-spun yarn. If we want others to
weave khadi, we must begin spinning. We do not want those women who
spin for money to give up their other occupations and spin for us. We
want to make those spin who do not get even two pice. In our country
where one gets only <i>roti</i><i> </i>and salt, the wheel is a

While doing the work of spinning do not go over to weaving. If we
want fine yarn we have to spin with our own hands, and without fine

On my returning to India [from Africa], I [first] went to Ahmedabad,
consulted the citizens there, placed my views before them and
established my Ashram there only after they had agreed  to support
and help me for one year. In my consultations with them I had also
spoken of my views on the issue of <i>Antyajas. </i>I said that I did
not discriminate even against those belonging to other  faiths  and
would most certainly admit <i>Antyajas</i>. They told me that I would
never get <i>Antyajas </i>of the type I had mentioned. Well, I
decided to stay there, got utensils and others articles of household
use. But there was no money. But I had faith [ in God]. A few months
passed and Duda- bhai<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>arrived with a note from Thakkar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. As soon as I took him in, the people of Ahmedabad
decided to boycott me. The people who drew water from the same well
as we also boycotted us. But I told them that I would bear everything
they might do, but would not leave Ahmedabad. If it is God’s will
that I should live here, I told them, He will enable me to do so,
otherwise I would go and live among  <i>Antyajas. </i>I knew, I said,
what my self-respect required, and would not feel insulted by their
talking angrily with me. After five days, the people using the well
melted and Dudabhai was permitted to draw water from it. But the
problem of money remained. But on the day I had no money left, God
came in person and gave me the money I needed. One fine day, a car
drove up to the  Ashram gate.  A gentleman whom I had never met
previously alighted from it, came up to me and told me that he wanted
to donate Rs. 13,000, and asked me if I would accept the money. Next
day he came with Rs. 13,000 in banknotes, gave the money to me and
left. That Satyagraha Ashram still exists. I wanted to be loyal to my
principles of satyagraha and stand my ground in Ahmedabad. The
Ahmedabad people have not deserted me, they come to see me and I
enjoy their goodwill. This is so simply because I had bound them with
the chain of love and I was confident that I would get the reward of
my love from Ahmedabad</p>

I am supposed to take away with me this lock and key, as also this
trowel which has not been soiled with earth at all. The gold coins
which Shri Dhorajiwala has given to me, I will hand over to Fulchan-
dbhai. Both these things have a meaning. A good many activities are
going on in the country at present; who can say how many of them are
genuine, or what self-sacrifice and sincerity of effort lie behind
them? I, for one, do not know. All that I know is that of the 
innumerable institutions which are being run in the country at
present, a few, we can say, have life in them. An English poet has
said, describing Heaven, that St. Peter stands guard at its gate, and
the key with which he opens the gate is of iron and not of gold.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Explaining
this, another poet has said that it is not easy to open the gate of
Heaven, that it cannot be opened with a key made of gold since gold
is a rather soft metal, whereas iron is supposed to be one of the
strongest metals. The gate, therefore, can be opened only with a key
made of iron. Here in Kathiawar we say of a very difficult task that
it is as difficult as chewing iron pellets. Running an institution
like this is   a task of that kind. For building the walls of a
library, a trowel made of silver can be of no use. We need one made
of iron. Likewise, we cannot use a silver padlock for locking its
doors. We must have an iron one. There is, thus, an artificiality
about the first steps we have taken in  doing both these things. I

spreading some earth; the work of building will be done  by  the
masons and the doors of the temple [of knowledge] will be opened by
the teachers. A library does not mean a building containing books, or
the books in it, or idle visitors who do not read the books. Were it
otherwise, we would find many booksellers to be men of character.
Because the building of the nursery school is a fine one, and much
money has been spent on it, can we say that the school will flourish?
It will do so only if it gets the services of men who can run it on
sound lines, only if it has a soul in it. Ordinarily Ido not like to
perform the opening ceremony of such institutions, for how does it
help me to do so? But I agreed to perform the opening ceremony of
this because I have faith in the workers who are behind it. That is
all. You should not suppose that any particular good will follow
because I have performed the opening ceremony. I am a bird ever on
the wing. Today I am here, tomorrow I may be in Ahmedabad and the day
after in Delhi. However, I welcome your exploiting my name to do what
good you can. The survival of this library will not depend on the
support of the rich, or on the children using it or on anyone
donating a hundred thousand gold coins. On the contrary, all that
money may prove to be an obstacle. It has been my experience that
whenever I received much help in money the cause suffered. At the
time of the struggle in South Africa, as soon as money poured in from
this country the movement lost its vigour, in the same way that
Yudhishthira’s cha-riot  came down a little nearer the earth when
he said: “Whether man or elephant I do not know.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

we require for that length of time can be obtained by eight hours’
work. Everyone should be satisfied with that. This is my reason for
not wishing that this institution should prosper financially. It
should have only enough to enable the workers to keep body and  soul
together while they serve it; they will lay down their lives for it
if they find it necessary to do so.</p>

mushrooms do. The point of what I have been saying is that the
workers who are attending this meeting and have pledged themselves to
lay down their lives for it, should put their faith in god and, even
when they feel that they are drowning, they should cling to their
faith and keep swimming. If they do not act thus, you may be certain
that they will invite upon themselves the curses of the country, for
they will not have justified this imposing building. Such palatial
buildings may be all right for Princes and Rulers, but this building
may be all right for Princes and Rulers, but this building will
become the poverty of the country, if we do not justify it by an
appropriate return to the country by way of service and if the
workers do not feel haunted by it as by a ghost so long as they have
not been able to render such return. The establishment of this
institution and my performing its opening ceremony will have been
justified if Shri Fulchand and his co-workers live in it as men who
had given up all attachment, even as king Janaka was known to have
done though he lived in a palace. If, however, the spirit of
renunciation vanishes and love of comfort comes to prevail in its
place, the institution is bound to perish. That school alone is a
national school which helps us to win swaraj and all whose teachers
abide by the rules, are inspired by a spirit of self-sacrifice and
lead an austere life.</p>

I was pained to hear that the citizens of Wadhwan have boy- cotted
this institution. Money should be available locally for an
institution for as long as it is in need, and the workers who run it
should also be able to win the goodwill of the local population. The
position of public workers like us who are fighting for swaraj is
difficult, for they are also reformers. A reformers finds himself in
an anomalous position, for he is not able to enter the atmosphere of
the locality and is content to receive that help he can get from
outside. Otherwise, what connection can Dr. Mehta of Rangoon have
with this school? Wadhwan contributed to the fund even though they
knew Shri Fulchand’s views about serving <i>Antyajas</i>; I do not
understand, then, why the people have boycotted him now. I should
like them to come and put their point of view to me, tell me what
they feel.</p>

A national institution means one which strengthens the nation’s

character, it does not become national by having a large number of
pupils and enabling them to make a living. They are indeed welcome to
work for their livelihood; but it is not the aim of education to
equip</p>

them for that purpose. Its aim is to awaken the pupil’s soul, to
bring out his spiritual powers, to train his body, intellect and
soul. I am told that such a large number of pupils are enrolled in
the school at Wankaner because its results at examinations are one
hundred per cent. This a narrow way of measuring its worth.</p>

Probably it is true that the teachers there are good; however, the
children are enrolled there not in the hope that they will learn from
the teachers to live virtuous lives, but in the expectation that
because of the teachers’ efficiency they will pass the
examinations. We must abandon this narrow criterion. The Vidyapith
and the national schools exist in order that we may learn to do so. I
urge the parents, therefore, to support such institutions, and urge
the teachers to remain loyal to their ideals, to welcome suffering
and to draw the pupils to them by the strength of their character. If
they succeed in this, my coming here and performing the opening
ceremony will have been fully rewarded.</p>

There is no other province as poor as Utkal. Khadi work, therefore,
could progress better there than anywhere else. But the above letter
tells us that the work done there is the poorest. The reason is well
known. Where food is scarce, energy and enthusiasm for work
disappear. If good workers are steadily forthcoming, Utkal can be
trusted to overtake all other provinces.</p>

A gentleman writes: “Will it not be much better if, instead of
purchasing hand-spun yarn and sending it to you, we send you the
requisite amount for khadi and wear it?” There is a
misunderstanding behind this question. The Congress has demanded not
one of the two things, but both of them. First, everyone should send
2,000 yards of hand-spun yarn every month whether spun by oneself or
someone</p>

else. Secondly, everyone should wear khadi. And so there is no
alternative, but the two together are obligatory. A mere spinner
cannot become a Congress member nor can a mere khadi-wearer. And this
is quite right. By making spinning universal we shall increase the
production of khadi and by making the use of khadi universal we shall
increase the consumption of khadi. That along will remove starvation

This gentleman further writes: “When I went to persuade a woman to
wear khadi, she objected: ‘If I wear khadi, my husband may be
attracted by a woman using foreign or mill-cloth and thus lose his
character.” I cannot expect such a reply from any virtuous woman.
But since the issue has been raised it should be considered. If any
husband deviates from his moral course simply because his wife
observes simplicity or performs her duty, then the  virtuous  wife 
should scarcely care for him. A man’s character is not worth
anything if he could be tempted merely by another woman’s clothes. 
A  husband who is seduced by a change in dress can also be seduced by
a more beautiful woman.</p>

My experience, however, is contrary to the statement of this woman. I
know hundreds of husbands who have been delighted to find their wives
in khadi clothes. Their household expenditure has been reduced and
their love for their khadi-clad wives has grown. But it is also
possible that this sister had no mind to use khadi and so unawares
she might have raised this unworthy objection. I appeal to the
sisters who think like her to take boldly to khadi and realize that
beauty does not consist in dress but in purity of character, and
clothes are not meant for adornment but for protecting the body from
heat and cold.</p>

Unwarranted expenses on such heads as marriages and deaths have all
soared so high that they cannot be met without incurring debts or

but all the processes of cloth production. This is an occupation that
requires very little capital and also very little physical strength.
This can offer a good livelihood if one gives up the prevalent pomp,

many of us will take to weaving as a profession or earn our bread by

It is sign of the times that in all these places I noticed among the
people the keenest desire for total prohibition. In Rajkot it is most
keen-ly felt, because there an unhealthy an ugly competition is going
on bet-ween the State liquor shops and the Civil Station liquor
shops. The result is that the prices have considerably gone down and
the lower classes are taking to liquor more than ever before. Their
womenfolk are bitterly complaining about the havoc that is being
played in their families owing to men returning day after day in a
drunken state. People are urging the Thakore Saheb to abolish liquor
shops altogether. The latter is reluctant to do so on the ground of
individual liberty. He is of opinion that temperance should be
brought about by preaching. The State Assembly has unanimously passed
a resolution requesting the Darbar to close all licensed liquor
shops, and prohibit distillation of liquor except for medicinal
purposes, if necessary. It will be interesting to learn how the
Thakore Saheb deals with this resolution.</p>

I have read today your commentary on my statement on Kohat. I honour
you and love you all the more for your out-spokenness. But your
commentary shows how with all the detachment and impartiality in the
world sometimes people most closely related as we are can come to
opposite conclusions on identical facts. It makes me more charitable
than ever towards opponents and more distrustful of my judgment even
than I am. I have twice read your commentary and I see the wide gulf
that separates us in the affair. I am prepared to strongly condemn
the publication of the poem but I am unable to condone the looting
and arson. I do not endorse your opinion that the pamphlet was the
cause of the conflagration. The ground was already prepared. I cannot
treat the conversions as lightly as you seem to do. In my opinion the
Khilafatists have greatly neglected their duty and Maulvi Ahmed Gul
certainly betrayed the trust reposed in him.</p>

I do not say these things to influence your opinion if there is no
cause for it. But I do want you to look more deeply into the facts
than you have done and see whether there is cause for
reconsideration. I tremble to publish our statements. The publication
will give rise to an acrimonious discussion. I would therefore even
suggest the whole matter being examined by Hakim Saheb or Dr. Ansari.
I would love to have new light on the question. I would like all the
friends to look at the facts and try to influence us both. But if
after we have exhausted all our resources to come to a joint
conclusion, we fail, we must dare to let the public know our
difference of opinion and know too that we shall still love one
another and work together. But that very love demands that we take no
hasty action. Are you coming to Delhi? If you are, let us travel
together. I leave by the metergauge on 27th. But if you are coming
and you would rather leave by the Punjab Mail I would join you at
Baroda. It may be advisable to have leisurely discussion between us.
The train seems to be the best place for such discussion. Do let me
know what you would like to do. Please wire if</p>

	Prayer time is the best time for words of blessing. On two earlier
	occasions, when young people who grew up in the Ashram were married
	off, many among us did not appreciate the significance of the
	occasion. Whoever comes to the Ashram, whether children or married
	men, would like to observe <i>brahmacharya</i>; and, therefore, how
	can marriage be solemnized in the Ashram where is the aim  is  to
	encourage everyone in the observance of <i>brahmacharya </i>? It is
	natural that the question should arise in the minds of many people;
	and yet three marriages came to be solemnized here. Though the
	regulations of the Ashram are strict, we are unable to enforce
	discipline. It is not easy to impart training in <i>brahmacharya </i>to
	young persons. Not that older folk are able to observe <i>brahmacharya
	</i>strictly. To fulfil an ideal, one should have ardour in one’s
	heart. The subject is so profound that the more I delve into it, the
	more aweinspiring it seems and I see its beauty and drink deep of
	its delights.</p>

There were three such cases. In order to pacify my mind I took the
one way out. The ceremonial should be performed outside the precincts
of the Ashram. One should get married without deceiving the inner
self or the outer world. And then one should come to the Ashram and
receive everyone’s blessings.</p>

If marry one must, it should not be to indulge the senses but to
practise self-control—this must be made clear to the married couple
as well as the inmates of the Ashram. Inmates should not eagerly look
forward to wedding occasions. It is a different matter if they can’t
be avoided. That is an event linking the soul and God. That is why in
English the soul is feminine in gender. Jaydev has also descried the
soul as a feminine entity sporting with the Supreme Being. Little
remains to be done in this world after such marriage of spirits. If
marriages must take place even when this union of souls does not
obtain, well, let it be so. It is necessary for me to tell you on
this, the fourth, occasion that marriage is not meant for greed but
for sacrifice. Resolve that even if you wish to derive sense pleasure
from this relationship, you will do so within limits. Among us the
rule of fidelity is meant for women only, though the last four
morsels given to [the couple] while solemnizing the marriage stand
for the union of flesh, spirit and bone. It is a pity we did not lay
down a similar rule for men. Therefore I can only say that you must
live in moderation and realize that the pleasures of the body should
be only a means of procreation.</p>

Who has the right to give birth to a child in these terrible times?
Countless persons in India observe <i>brahmacharya </i>and many  in 
Europe as well. Among Roman Catholics, there are many adult men and
women who observe <i>brahmacharya </i>throughout their life. An
eighteen-year-old girl walks out of worldly life andobserves unbroken
<i>brahmacharya</i>. They have monastries and nunneries where such
men and women live. In these hard times no one in India has the right
to beget children. No one has at any time the right to bear children
before one is strong enough.</p>

I wanted the marriage to be solemnized in the Ashram, because the
priest performing the rites would explain their significance and you
could thus learn that marriage is not a matter of pleasure but of
self-control. Both of you, therefore, should understand this occasion
and remember it. I have taken upon myself one responsibility and I
will never regret it. The result is bound to be beneficent. You know
my relations with Vallabhbhai. He asked me of his own free will that</p>

this marriage be solemnized by me. Kashibhai was also favourable to
the idea. There is no need for spending lots of money on a marriage.
It is penance that is needed. Outside the Ashram a marriage cannot
take place without money being spent, for you cannot have only the
religious rite, leaving out things like  <i>barat</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>. That is why the marriage has been solemnized here. The
seed that is sown will grow into a tree. But be worthy of your
parents to nurture that seed and eschew worldly pleasures. For not
spending money, the motive was not stinginess, and it certainly was
not greed. Such expenditure bears heavily on the <i>Patidar </i>families
and our intention was to save them from it altogether. I have known
Dahyabhai for a long time and Yashoda too. I feel confident that they
are strong enough through self-control to add lustre to this
marriage. All these things which I say to inmates of the Ashram
can-not be said too often. I do not mean to seek out such</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; line-height: 102%"><a name="171. THE EMBARGO"></a>
occasions, for that is not my vocation. But if they arise, I perform
the ceremonies in the hope that self-control can be strengthened
thus. This may well be an illu-sion. I do not wish not to take the
chance if it comes. But I wish for all of you that you develop more
self-control through such occasions. That is why we are all assembled
here. Let us pray to God that we may attain our ideals and we may
bring up men and women here who do not think about marriage and
procreation, but who regard all children as their own, and who spend
their lives in serving children who have no sunshine in their lives.
Dahyabhai and Yashoda must think for themselves and realize how great
is their responsibility. It seems to me as if they have lost their
freedom today. But this state too can be beautiful. Let them be happy
and restrained. Let them breathe the spirit of sacrifice and be
worthy of their parents and also of us; so that no one may feel like
asking why this marriage was celebrated in the Ashram.</p>

It is quite true that my going to Kohat is likely to reopen the
settlement in so far as it is intrinsically bad. It is settlement
brought about my coercion, for it has been arrived at under threat of
prosecu- tions on either side. It is not a voluntary settlement that
pleases the parties. Both the Hindus and the Mussalmans whom Maulana
Shaukat Ali and I met at Rawalpindi said as much. But my visit to
Kohat, whatever else it may or may not bring about, can never mean
greater estrangement between the parties. If, therefore, I had been
permitted together with Mussalman friends to proceed to Kohat it
would have meant furtherance of peace which the Viceroy claims to
have at heart equally with me. Whilst, therefore, I was able somewhat
to understand the refusal when the things were still in a ferment, I
am unable to understand the prohibition at the present moment.
Friends were not wanting who suggested that I should have proceeded
to Kohat without permission or intimation and taken the risk of a
prohibition order. I could not do so unless I meant to disobey any
such order and court imprisonment. And as I hold that there is no
atmosphere at the present moment in the country for any such step I
could  not  take  the proposed risk. I can only hope that the
authorities will appreciate the deliberation with which I am avoiding
every step that may precipitate civil resistance. My purpose so far
as it is humanly possible is to avoid taking a single step that may
even indirectly precipitate violence on the part of the people. But a
time must come when non-violent resistance on my part may become a
duty in total disregard of untoward consequences. I do not myself
know when such a time can or will come. I know that it is a
possibility. But when that time comes I hope that friends will not
find me wanting. Till then I must ask them to bear with me.</p>

I print the telegram, but alas! what immediate action can be taken?
Of Public sympathy the prisoners can be sure. I have little doubt

inhumanities ascribed to them. I trust that the Administrator of
Nabha will give a full explanation about the awful charges brought
against the prison authorities and court an impartial inquiry into
the allegations.</p>

to progressive opinion is a sad commentary on its “advanced”
state. The progressives really won the battle from a moral
standpoint. Whilst it is regrettable that 22 should have voted
against the use by the so- called untouchables of the public road in
question, it is consoling to</p>

find that 21 members vindicated the position taken by the Hindu
reformers by voting in favour of their resolution. The saddest part
of the letter, however, is the fact that the satyagrahis seem to be
losing hope. I do not wonder. Theirs is the first experience of
sustained satyagraha. Let me, however, assure them that victory is
assured. For their cause is just, their means non-violent. Let them
realize, too, that by their sufferings they have attracted the
attention of the world. Whoever knew Vykom before the struggle
commenced? They should also know that they are fighting an age-long
superstition. What is a year’s suffering on the part of a few
reformers in their attempt to break down the iron wall of prejudice?
To lose patience is to lose the battle. They must fight to the
finish. What is the alternative anyone can have in view? The breaking
of heads will not serve the purpose. Orthodoxy will stiffen its back
and will suck nourishment out of the blood of its martyrs. For if the
orthodox are injured, sympathy will irresistibly be drawn towards
them though their cause is wrong. To attempt to force the entry will
invite stronger barricades. And even if force succeeded, it would
merely mean mechanical use of a single public road and not change of
opinion.</p>

What, however, the Hindu reformers want is the conversion of the
orthodox people who have made of untouchability a religion. This they
will only do by sufferings such as they are now undergoing.
Satyagraha is the shortest cut to success. All the reforms that have
been brought about by violent methods have taken not one year but
years. The victory of enlightenment over darkness in Europe was a
long and torturing process. And one is not sure that it was a lasting
success. There was no conversion of those who opposed and died. The
others who were converted were attracted by the sufferings of those
who died even whilst inflicting death on their opponents. The net
legacy that age bequeathed the world was a confirmation of belief in
methods of violence. I hope therefore that the satyagrahis of Vykom
will not swerve from their path even though their ranks may  be
thinned and victory may seem further off than ever. Satyagraha is
utter self-effacement, greatest humiliation, greatest patience and
brightest faith. It is its own reward.</p>

The Sub-Committee appointed by the All-Parties Conference Committee
is to meet once more on the 28th instant at Delhi. No Sub- Committee
had perhaps a more difficult task before it. The Sub- Committee
redivided itself into two groups, one for drafting a skeleton swaraj
scheme and the other for framing a skeleton Hindu-Muslim Unity
scheme. Dr. Besant was Chairman of the Swaraj group of the
Sub-Committee and she has already presented a report for the
consideration of the Sub-Committee. The adjournment took place for
the consideration of the Hindu-Muslim question as no  agreement could
be reached last time, and as the desire was expressed that the
members then present should be able to confer with those who were
absent and those others who though not members might be able to
assist in reaching an agreement. It is to be hoped that those who can
will attend the forthcoming meeting. Lala Lajpat Rai has telegraphed
asking me to postpone the meeting to a date after the third week of
March. Several members have informed him that they will not be able
to attend. I have informed him<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>saying
 that  I  could  not  postpone without reference to the meeting
itself and that the meeting might postpone if it was thought
desirable. Everybody has by this time made up his mind as to what
should be done. No new light would possibly be thrown on the question
at the forthcoming meeting. The only question for consideration would
be whether there is a middle course between the two extremes that
were discussed at Delhi at the last meeting. That leads to another
question. Is there a will on the part of both the parties to find an
immediate solution ? The swaraj scheme is also a tremendously
important problem. Only, the Hindu-Muslim question seems to block all
progress. I do hope that all who are at all able will come and assist
the deliberations. I would advise the  absentees to send in their
opinions lest the meeting should decide to continue its deliberations
instead of postponing as suggested by Lalaji.</p>

his imprisonment was a gross injustice and because that injustice has

What they have now received from the Acharya they could have had long
ago. In fact as has been repeatedly pointed out in these columns,
Acharya Gidwani never entered the Nabha boundary in order to defy
orders. He entered purely and simply in order to perform  a
humanitarian service. But neither the nation nor the Acharya has lost
by the imprisonment. It is the necessary training for swaraj and the
price that one must pay for liberty.</p>

but I dare not ignore the incidents now reported especially when a
personal appeal for expression of opinion is made to me. I understand
that the stoning method is enjoined in the Koran only in certain
circumstances which do not cover the cases under observation. But as
a human being living in the fear of God I  should  question  the
morality of the method under any circumstance whatsoever. Whatever
may have been necessary or permissible during the Prophet’s
lifetime and in that age, this particular form of penalty cannot be
defended on the mere ground of its mention in the Koran. Every
formula of every religion has in this age of reason, to submit to the
acid test of reason and universal justice if it is to ask for
universal assent. Error can claim no exemption even if it can be
supported by the scriptures of the world. I extend my sympathy to the
sect in its distress. Needless to say I can express no opinion on the
merits of the case. I do not think the public has any data for
forming an opinon on merits. It is the form penalty that wounds the
human conscience. Both reason and heart refuse to reconcile
themselves to torture for any crime, no matter how vile the crime may
be.</p>

deserves an answer. I have great regard for the missionaries for
their zeal and self-sacrifice. But I have not hesitated to point out
to them that both are often misplaced. What though the Bible were
translated in every tongue in the world? Is a patent medicine better
than the Upanishads for being advertised in more languages than the
Upanishads? An error does not become truth by reason of multipled
propagation, nor does truth become error becase nobody will see it.
The Bible was a greater power when the early fathers preached it than
it is today. “A well-wisher” has little conception of the way
truth works, if he thinks that the translation of the Bible in more
languages than the Upanishads is any test of its superiority. Truth
has to be lived if it is to fructify. But if it is any satisfaction
to “A well-wisher” to have my answer I may gladly tell him that
the Upanishads and the <i>Gita </i>have been translated into far
fewer languages than the Bible. I</p>

As for the second question, too, I must own that the missionaries
have founded many leper asylums and the like. I have founded none.
But I stand unmoved. I am not competing with the missionaries or
anybody else in such matters. I am trying humbly to serve humanity as
God leads me. The founding of leper asylums, etc., is only one of the
ways, and perhaps not the best, of serving humanity. But even such
noble service loses much of its nobility when conversion is the
motive behind it. That service is the noblest which is rendered for
its own sake. But let me not be misunderstood. The missionaries that
selflessly work away in such asylums command my respect. I am ashamed
to have to confess that Hindus have become so callous as to care
little for the waifs and strays of India, let alone the world.</p>

A Bengal zamindar sends me a long letter dealing with Hindu- Muslim
unity, untouchability and swaraj. The letter is too long for
publication and covers no new ground. I cull, however, one typical
sentence from it. It is:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.09cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">For
over 500 years the relation between Hindus and Mussalmans was that of
foes. After the advent of British rule both the Mussalmans and Hindus
were compelled out of policy to forget that racial hatred and the
acrimony of that bitter enmity is now no more. But the permanent
difference in the constitution of these two races does even now
exist. I believe the present cordial relation is due to British rule
and not to the catholicity of modern Hinduism.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0cm; line-height: 102%">
I regard this statement as pure superstition. The two races lived at
peace among themselves during the Mussalman rule. Let it be
remembered that many Hindus embraced Islam before the advent of
Muslim rule in India. It is my belief that had there been no Muslim
rule, there would still have been Mussalmans in India even as there
would have been Christians had there been no British rule. There is
nothing to prove that Hindus and Mussalmans lived at war with one
another before the British rule. My belief is that the British policy
of “divide and rule” has accentuated our differences and will
continue to do so, till we recognize that we must unite in spite of
the policy. This cannot and will not happen unless we refrain from a
scramble for place and power. The beginning must be made by the
Hindus.</p>

the distressing problem of cattle, uneconomic holdings and want of
occupation for the peasantry all the year round. All these, apart
from the burden of taxation, deepen the poverty of the masses and
deserve conside-ration at the hands of all patriots. Everyone of them
is capable of being handled in an effective manner. In a country
where the cow is an object of worship, there should be no cattle
problem at all. But our cow-worship has resolved itself into an
ignorant fanati- cism. The fact that we have more cattle than we can
support is a matter for urgent treatment. I have already suggested
the taking over of the question by cow-protection societies. It is
their legitimate function. The question of uneconomic holdings
requires revision of the family system. The question of wanton
destruction of manure requires a true agricultural education and that
of unemployment for half the year for millions of men and women can
only be solved by the spinning- wheel. It is clear that to the fight
with the Government we must add a scientific study and handling of
the problems discussed by Mr. Sam Higginbottom.</p>

you wish me to write about it, discuss it with me when I reach the
Ashram towards the end of March.</p>

certainly very fine to look at. Bhai Mahadev and I have both tried
it; it works very well. I wonder if anyone at our place can  set  it 
up properly. Please let me know how it works. I had asked Chi.
Maganlal to send one more charkha; I do not know if it has reached

The memories of my visit to Kathiawar, which lasted from the 15th to
21st , will ever remain fresh in my mind. I was delighted to see the
independence displayed by the Thakore Saheb of Rajkot. I had my
misgivings about the usefulness of the People’s Representative
Assembly, but my presence during this body’s deliberations for
three hours dispelled them. The ultimate benefit from this
organization would be known only in the future but it can be said
that it is useful even in its present form. It rests with the
representatives to increase its utility. The representatives have
complete freedom to express themselves and they were seen exercising
this to the full. Nobody seemed to worry about what views the Thakore
Saheb would approve. The representatives expressed even such views as
were likely to offend the Thakore Saheb.</p>

As the proceedings were conducted in Gujarati, the atmos- phere was
lively. Here was none of the artificiality, snobbery, and so on that
one finds in English speeches. Some speeches, one could say, were
excellent and effective. The speeches did not drag on and most of
them were to the point. I would not consider this council inferior to
any other assembly in respect of debating ability, self-restraint and
orderly procedure.</p>

Prohibition was the main topic discussed by the Assembly. It
unanimously passed a resolution to the effect that the Durbar should
ban the distillation of liquor. The representatives knew that the
Thakore Saheb was opposed to this resolution. And yet it was passed a
second time.</p>

The Thakore Saheb had himself argued with the representatives. Hence
his views on this subject could be known. He argued that if drink
shops were banned, individual liberty would be curtailed. I think
that there is a great flaw in this argument. It is difficult to
understand how individual liberty is curtailed if liquor shops are
closed down. People did not want drinking to be considered a crime,
but they wanted a ban on the preparation and sale of liquor. No
society or individual is entitled to prepare or sell a thing if it is
considered harmful by them. Everyone is aware of the harm done by
drinking. As there can be no liberty for anyone to steal, there can
be none to distil or sell liquor. Those who cannot do without liquor 
may transgress the law. Many instances of such restrictions are found
even in countries where individual liberty is cherished. Liberty and
license are not the same thing. One cannot have the license to act as
one pleases. If such license exists, then the goddess of liberty can
never stay there. Everyone has the right to enjoy as much liberty as
will not harm others. There is a legal maxim<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>in
English that one should use one’s property in such a way that
others are not injured. I have every right to dig up my whole plot of
land but I cannot dig it so that the foundation of my neighbour’s
house is damaged. If a section of the people drinks wine, the evil
consequences are not suffered by the drinkers alone but their
children and neighbours also suffer. America has closed down drink
shops and breweries. That has not resulted in</p>

Assuming that the ban on the drink trade would  curtail individual
liberty, even then, if the people clearly hold a unanimous view, it
is the duty of the ruler to act according to the wishes of the
people. That is a principle recognized all over the world. There was
no one in the People’s Representative Assembly who did not desire a
ban on the drink trade. There is evidence to show that the addicts
themselves desire such a ban. Their families have suffered. It will
be regrettable if the Thakore Saheb does not respect the wishes of
the people in this matter. The ruler has taken the initiative in
forming the People’s Representative Assembly, and I would expect
that he will not disregard the people’s wish clinging to wrong
reasoning and that he will earn the sincere blessings of the poor by
banning the drink trade.</p>

The Thakore Saheb of Rajkot is a stickler for regularity. He does all
his work at the appointed hour and diligently goes through all his
appointments, and makes others do the same. He loves discipline. He
believes that our greatest drawback is lack of discipline. That this
is very much so cannot be denied. The people are not able to fulfil
their good intentions for want of rules and discipline.</p>

I kept your letter by me all this time. I can see nothing to except
in Maulana Mahomed Ali’s statement.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

in height that the former is superior to the latter in height,
although the latter is superior to the former in every other respect?
May not the Maulana truthfully say that he is superior to the
so-called greatest man in the world in so far at least as the Maulana
believes a religion which in his opinion is the best of all? I think
the Maulana has legitimately drawn the contrast.</p>

see your note on Hindu-Muslim question. He therefore sent it to me. I
have read and reread it. I am entirely in favour of the Mussalmans in
the Punjab and Bengal having representation in accordance with their
numbers. But I have been unable to follow the argument in favour of
separate electorates. Its working seems to be proving unsatisfactory
almost everywhere. And if you have separate electorates for one
community you can hardly resist such a claim on behalf of the others
and finally by sub-sects. This must mean ruin of nationalism. Have
you given a thought to the proposal made by me?</p>

for coming to any definite conclusions. Nor is there likeli- hood of
any being reached in the near future. We, therefore, see no hope of
being able to convene a general meeting of the Conference within the
prescribed period except upon a requisition referred to by us. The
failure to reach a decision is likely to disapoint the public. We
would, however, advise publicists and others not to despond. That the

The reader will see from the statement published in the Press that
the Sub-committee of the All-Party Conference has not been able to
come to any decision on the problem of problems. But perhaps it was
as well that it did not. The atmosphere for a reasonable solution is
lacking. Each distrusts the other. In such circumstances there can be
no common ground of action. Each necessarily wants to surrender as
little as possible. Nor does one notice a real anxiety on the part of
any of the parties for a solution. There is, however, no cause for
despair. The present failure may be a stepping-stone to success, if
those who can trust and who have no fear of one another will be true
to their faith and try to work at a solution. Any solution to be
national must disregard the Government, i.e., must have inherent
working power and must not depend for its proper working upon the
goodwill of the Government.</p>

I have a long telegram describing a daring dacoity attempted in
Sukkur at 10 p.m. on the 22nd near the Police Station and in the
heart of the town. The telegram adds that the bankers are feeling
unsafe and that the dacoits are still uncaught. The object of the
telegram no doubt is to excite public sympathy and criticism of a
Government the most expensive in the world and yet failing to afford
simple protection to life and property. That sympathy the citizens of
Sukkur  have. Criticism of the Government they may also have by the
cartload. But the more relevant question is what the bankers were
doing when the dacoits came. From the telegram it would appear that

difference there was bound to be so long as human nature remained
what it was and so long as there was a conflict between European
culture and the Indian, a legal recognition of the difference in the
shape of the introduction of the Bar sinister in the laws of the
country was an intolerable burden. The settlement of 1914 chiefly
consisted in the vindication of the Indian position. With General
Smuts’  opposition we may hope that the Bill will now be dropped.
But let us not deceive ourselves. The Natal Disfranchising Bill
recently passed is an extension of the “Bar Sinister”. General
Smut’ opposition therefore means only a protest against the bar
being introduced even in the matter of employment, not against the
bar altogether. However I tender my congratulations to General Smuts
on his plain speech at the risk of still further weaken-ing his
political position in his country. We may not be satisfied till the
South African statute-book is purged of all legal inequality as
between whites and Asiatics or better still as between white and
coloured people.</p>

So far as the conscientious objection is concerned the mention of God
may be removed if required from the Congress pledge of which I am
proud to think I was the author. Had such an objection been raised at
the time, I would have yielded at once. I was unpre- pared for the
objection in a place like India. Though there is officially the

Buddhists and Jains are atheists or agnostics. The latter they cannot
be. Those who believe in the soul as apart from and capable of life
independent of and after the dissolution of the body cannot be called
atheists. We may all have different definitions or “God”. If we
could all give our own definitions of God there would be as many
defini- tions as there are men and women. But behind all that variety
of definitions there would be also a certain sameness which would be
unmistakable. For the root is one. God is that indefinable something
which we all feel but which we do not know. Charles Bradlaugh
described himself as an atheist no doubt but many  a  Christian 
declined to regard him as such. He recognized in Bradlaugh a greater
kinship with himself than many a lip Christian. I had the privilege
of attending the funeral of that good friend of India. I noticed
several clergymen at the function. There were certainly several
Mussalmans and many Hindus in the procession. They all believed in
God. Bradlaugh’s denial of God was a denial of Him as He was known
to Bradlaugh to have been described. His was an eloquent and
indignant protest against the then current theology and the terrible
contrast between precept and practice. To me God is truth and love;
God is ethics and morality; God is fearlessness. God is the source of
Light and Life and yet He is above and beyond all these. God is
conscience. He is even the atheism of the atheist. For in His
boundless love God permits the atheist to live. He is the searcher of
hearts. He transcends speech and reason. He knows us and our hearts
better than we do ourselves. He does not take us at our word for He
knows that we often do not mean it, some knowingly and others
unknowingly. He is a personal God to those who need His personal
presence. He is embodied to those who need His touch. He is the
purest essence. He simply Is to those who have faith. He is all
things to all men. He is in us and yet above and beyond us. One may
banish the word “God” from the Congress but one has no power to
banish the Thing Itself. What is a solemn affirmation if it is not
the same thing as in the name of God. And surely conscience is but a
poor and laborious paraphrase of the simple combination of three
letters called God. He cannot cease to be because hideous
immoralities or inhuman brutalities are comm- itted in His name. He
is long suffering. He is patient but He is also terrible. He is the
most exacting personage in the world and the world to come. He metes
out the same measure to us that we mete out to our neighbours—men
and brutes. With Him ignorance is no excuse. And withal He is ever
forgiving for He always gives us the chance to</p>

repent. He is the greatest democrat the world knows, for He leaves us
“unfettered” to make our own choice between evil and good. He is
the greatest tyrant ever known, for He often dashes the cup from our
lips and, under cover of free will, leaves us a margin so wholly
inadequate as to provide only mirth for Himself at our expense.
Therefore, it is that Hinduism calls it all His sport—<i>lila</i>,
or calls it all an illusion—<i>maya</i>. We are <i>not </i>, He
along <i>Is</i>. And if we will be, we must eternally sing His praise
and do His will. Let us dance to the tune of His <i>bansi</i>—lute,
and all would be well.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

Since reference has been made to a booklet<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>of
mine on ethics and religion, I must draw the attention of the reader
to the fact that what the correspondent refers to is a translation of
the original which is in Gujarati. But the Gujarati itself as the
preface makes it clear is not an original effort but an adaptation
from an American publication called <i>Ethical Religion </i>by Mr.
Salter. The translation came under my notice in Yeravda Jail and I
regretted to notice the absence of any mention of the source from
which I had borrowed. The translator himself I understand did not
rely upon the original Gujarati but a Hindi translation. The English
rendering therefore is a round-about thing. I owe this explanation to
the author of the original book and I am glad that the mention of the
work by my correspondent has reminded me of my obligation.</p>

teachings of the Holy Koran. But I have criticised the teachers, that
is, the interpreters, in anticipation of their defending the penalty
of stoning to death. I claim to understand enough of the Koran and
the history of Islam to know that a multitude of interpreters have
interpreted the Koran to suit their preconceived notions. My purpose
was to issue a warning against the acceptance of such
interpretations. But I would like to say that even the teachings
themselves of the Koran cannot be exempt from criticism . Every true
scripture only gains by criticism. After all we have no other guide
but our reason to tell us what may be regarded as revealed and what
may not be. The early Mussalmans accepted Islam not because they knew
it to be revealed but because it appealed to their virgin reason. I
fully endorse the Maulana’s statement that error is a relative
term. But we know as a matter of fact that some things are
universally accepted as errors. Death by torture is, I expect, such
an error. In making the three statements the Maulana has quoted, I
have simply mentioned three canons of interpretations which I think
are incapable of challenge. Anyway, I abide by them . And if I am at
perfect liberty to express my opinion “as to whether renegades can
be stoned to death under the law of Islam” why may I not express an
opinion as to whether</p>

penalty of stoning to death can be imposed at all under the law of
Islam? The Maulana has betrayed intolerance of criticism by a non
Muslim of anything relating to Islam. I suggest to him that
intolerance of criticism even of what one may prize as dear as life
itself is not conducive to the growth of public corporate life.
Surely Islam has nothing to fear from criticism even if it be
unreasonable. I therefore suggest to the Maulana the advisability in
the light of my criticism of applying himself to an elucidation of
the tremendous issues involved in the incidents reported from Kabul.</p>

Another friend properly remarks that it is not the people that are
apathetic. It is the workers, the leaders. They are doing nothing to
spread the gospel. The people have not yet developed that liking for
khaddar as to make them go out of their way to procure khaddar, but
if it is brought to their doors, they would gladly take it. The
harvest is indeed such but the labourers are few. Why will not every
worker make it a point to sell a given quantity of khaddar per month?
I know that we have made sufficient progress in the manufacture of
khaddar to be able to supply the most fastidious tastes. I was shown
the other day a rich bride’s trousers. It was all made of khaddar
and silver and gold embroidery. There was nothing wanting from a rich
man’s point of view. And the khaddar saris were as fine as one
could possibly desire. There was the inevitable richly-coloured shawl

I have telegrams from Faridpur urging me to attend the Bengal
Provincial Conference. I am extremely sorry for my inability to
attend it, much as I would love to do so. I had warned<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>the Faridpur friends not to rely upon my attendance. I
had told them that my movements were uncertain. Mine is not an
enviable position. I have calls from Bihar, Wardha, Orissa, Andhra
and several other places. I would like to visit all of them. But
since I cannot visit all at the same time, I must judge where I can
be of the greatest service at a particular moment. I feel that my
place just now is among the valiant band of satyagrahis at Vykom. It
is a promise long overdue. They are endeavouring to enforce the
doctrine of satyagraha in every minute detail. They are few in
number. They are fighting against heavy odds. Till now I have
interfered with their seeking monetary and other help from outside.
It is due to them that I should as a professing expert go to them and
guide them and hearten them for all that lies in front of them. The
friends from the other provinces will not grudge me or them this
privilege of long-deferred communion.</p>

What is more, whereas I fancy I can be of some assistance to these
satyagrahis, I feel sure that I can be of no use in the other
provinces except to be on show there. My prescription for them is
incredibly simple. Settle your local differences whether they are
between Hindus and Mussalmans or other or whether they are between
Brahmins and non-Brahmins. Spin as much as you can, wear khaddar on
all occasions, enrol as many selfspinning members as you can for the
Congress. And add to these those who will not spin themselves but
will gladly furnish 2,000 yards of yarn per month, hand-spun for them
by others. Help the suppressed classes in your district  or province

Mr. A. V. Thakkar, that friend of the suppressed classes, has sent me
a copy of the Report of the Committee appointed by the Bombay
Corporation to inquire into the ejection from municipal chawls of
certain members belonging to the suppressed classes. These poor men
and women have been driven out on the grounds that they are not in
municipal service, that some of them can afford to pay more and that
some others are undesirable persons against whom prosecutions have
been proved. On behalf of the evicted people it has been contended
that they are near relatives of the employees, that they have been
living in municipal chawls for years and that the evictions have been
brought about at the instance of corrupt municipal servants who could
not get bribes from the evicted persons. In the Municipal
Commissioner’s report it is stated that</p>

were such that no impartial person could accept them.</font></font></p>

cannot recall any such statement having been made by me. But</p>

the question of bribery is irrelevant. Even if every Municipal
official would be proved to be above corruption, the eviction of the
people other than employees is bad in principle <i>so far as the
suppressed classes are concerned. </i>Theirs is a special case. They
have nowhere to go to. They do not cluster together in municipal
chawls for the sake of finding cheap habitation. They live there
because they can procure no other for love or money. I hold that it
is the duty of the Corporation not only to let the relatives of the
suppressed class employees remain with them but it is also to provide
enough and decent additional accommodation for these classes. The
Corporation will be entitled to charge a reasonable rent for such
accommodation. I know instances of very respectable members belonging
to the suppressed classes having been unable to procure lodgings at
any rent whatsoever. The owners will not  let  their  houses  to 
these  classes. The objection of the Committee or the Municipal
Commissioner to</p>

valid, if it were raised in connection with any other class. I hope
therefore that the case will be reopened and provision made for every
one of the evicted men and women of the suppressed class.</p>

My views remain the same as hitherto. Unity is inevitable. It will
take longer than I had expected. The estrangement is undoubtedly
growing. Let us hope that even in the midst of the storm, same of us
will remain calm I am out for conquest. I as a Hindu will not
therefore quarrel with the Mussalmans, neither will I yield to
threats, such as I see are reported to have been uttered at Peshawar.
I am in correspon- dence<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  
</font></sup>both with Maulana Zafar Ali Khan and Dr. Kitchlew<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

must refuse to lose my head even if they have said all that has been
reported of them.I do not believe in the efficacy of retaliation. I
would urge the Hindus not to be angry over such incidents. But I see
that there is no settlement to be had in the near future. No lasting
settlement can be had by higgling. I cannot be interested in a fight
for sharing power with the bureaucracy. Such fight can only
strengthen British dominance. I would prefer anarchy to that
dominance. As equals I would value co-operation of the British, but I
would prefer anarchy to their dominance. For I know that we can never
become one nation through that dominance. I can see the chance of
reconciliation between Hindu and Mussalmans after</p>

a free and hearty fight, but I see none with British arms restraining
us. We must learn to restrain ourselves. My motto, therefore, is
“Unite now, today, if you can; fight if you must. But in every case
avoid British intervention”. I know that the temptation is great.
But, great or small, I must avoid it at all cost. I can see swaraj
rising out of the Thermopylae being enacted in every street or
village in India, but I can see no swaraj out of the armed neutrality
between the two communities. There is as much need for a change of
heart among the Hindus and Mussalmans, as there is among the British,
before a proper settlement is arrived at.</p>

Govern- ment and in such circumstances if I were the Government,
probably I would do exactly as the British are doing, i.e., try to
divide both and rule. What can one do with those who want to be
ruled? The Hindu- Muslim problem is therefore just now an insoluble
puzzle. I propose to keep out of it, holding myself available
whenever wanted. I believe in God, not as a theory but a fact, more
real than that of life itself. I must therefore wait upon Him. In the
hour of my need He will guide my steps on this question as He has
done hitherto. Meanwhile, in the spinning-wheel and untouchability, I

Your letter has been travelling with me all this time. I am now
writing this in the train that is taking me to Madras. I had no
intention of being inattentive to anybody at Belgaum. But what was I
to do ? I had not a moment for personal chats. I therefore hardened
my heart.</p>

You are morose. There is no occasion for it. Let us do the day’s
work to the best of our ability and smile. All work faithfully done
has the same value in the book of life. Why then should we worry?</p>

You have not asked any definite questions. But if you have any, pray
do not hesitate to ask them. Be assured that you are the same to me
that you were before. I treasure the memory of the faithful co-
workers of Champaran. I shall never have and never had a more
faithful band to work with. If I had such a band throughout India,
swaraj will not be long in coming to India.</p>

It is impossible for us to do propaganda through the British Press.
The British Press is bent upon furthering Imperial aims. However much
we give them facts about the actual position in India, they would not
publish them. At one time, factual material for publication as an
advertisement was sent to a British paper by a person along with the

you have been pleased to present to me. It is always a matter of
embarrassment for me to receive addresses. On several occasions I
have described myself as a scavenger, and I should be content if I
could die also as a scavenger. I am a lover of municipal work. Fates
have decided otherwise There was a time when I was myself thinking
seriously of taking to municipal life. It is a life in which a great
deal of plodding is required. I am myself a plodder, and I call
myself a scavenger because I believe in sanitation from more than one
point of view, that is to say, in outward sanitation, as also inward
sanitation.</p>

I am not a stranger to Madras. I have lived off and on several
occasions in Madras, sufficiently long to enable me to study and
understand the sanitation of your city; and it has always grieved me
whenever I have walked through your streets early in the morning to
see them disfigured. I used to talk when I used to live with Mr.
Natesan<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>about the conditions of the streets of Madras. I do not
wish to single out the streets of Madras as if they are more
insanitary than the streets of other cities of India. But I cannot
help remarking upon the condition of your streets because I think
that more than any other city of India, the streets of Madras were at
that time disfigured even by grown-up elderly men. It was a sight to
which I must confess I was unused before I came to Madras, and often
did I feel like taking a broom myself and cleaning up every nook and
corner of the streets through which I passed. I still indulge in it
as a pastime. Whenever I can get a little bit of cleaning work, I
assure you, it gives me a pleasure and you could understand my
weakness also from municipal addresses. If I must receive addresses
at all, I always feel that the receipt of the municipal address does
give me opportunity to drive this one truth home to the citizens of
India. I feel that in the matter of outward sanitation we have to
learn a great deal from the West. It has been my painful duty often
to speak against the Western civilization and the methods of the
West. I, therefore, whenever I get  an opportunity, never miss the
opportunity of saying what we can legitimately and usefully learn
from the West; and I think that for the methods of sanitation in the
large cities that we have in India we cannot do better than go to the
West for the lessons. I wish I could drive the truth home to you that
scavenging is an occupation which is a noble occupation although it
may not give as much renown and that notoriety which services in
other departments of life bring to us. You</p>

You have said several things in your address in praise of such humble
services which I have been able to render in my capacity as a
humanitarian. I am humanitarian first, and I want to remain a
humanitarian up to the very last. I notice, however, one singular
omission from your address, and that is in connection with khaddar. I
would like to point out to you that among my humble services in the
cause of humanity I place khaddar almost in the forefront. Unity
among the different races and the different communities belonging to
different religions of India is indispensable to the birth of
national life. Remove the curse of untouchability, which is as
necessary as the removal of phthisis to an individual. It is eating
into the vitals of Hinduism, but the removal of the degrading poverty
of the masses is dependent upon khaddar and it is for that reason
that I say to every Indian, to every Englishman in India, every
foreigner who comes to India to visit me when they ask me what is it
that I would desire for a foreigner to do. I tell him: “Study the
conditions of my country and find out whether you have anything
better than simple  spinning- wheel, and if you find, after a careful
study of the conditions of India, that there is nothing better, speak
a word on behalf of the spinning- wheel.” I wish that I could
isolate the spinning-wheel from several other things, from the
politics of the country. But you are aware I have said on more than
one occasion that all these departments of life are interwoven and
intermixed, that it is impossible to isolate them from the other
departments of life. But I do know that, apart from the political
value of the spinning-wheel, and to produce khaddar, if we are to
remove the economic distress under which this  land  is labouring, if
we are to serve the dumb millions of India, we cannot do without
khaddar, we cannot do without the spinning-wheel. I therefore humbly
commend it to the attention of the Municipal Councillors. I ask you
to give it a place in your schools and I ask you whether you are
Englishmen or Indians, whether you are Mussalmans or Hindus, whether
you belong to one political school or other in the country, to give
place to the spinning-wheel and khaddar in your homes.</p>

I thank you all and the various associations sincerely for the
addresses that have been presented to me this afternoon. It is a
matter for great pity that even after so many years it is not
possible for you to understand Hindustani or Hindi and it is a matter
of shame and sorrow for me that I am unable to speak to you either in
Tamil or in Telugu. I was looking forward to the pleasure of being
able to address the audiences in the southern Presidency in Tamil if
I had  been allowed to finish my six years in Yeravda. Unfortunately
for me and unfortunately for you it was not to be. But I do hope that
a time will come, and that soon, when you will insist upon people
coming from the north and the western Presidency addressing you in
Hindustani. You know, and if you have not, you ought to know, that
over Rs. 75,000 have been brought from the other parts of India and
spent in the southern Presidency in order to induce it to pick up
Hindustani. There are teachers covering this Presidency who are
giving lessons in Hindi or Hindustani. After all you should take the
trouble of learning them. If you have not yet availed yourselves of
the opportunity afforded to you let me hope that you will do so now.</p>

It is but a stage in my journey that I find myself today in Madras. I
have come not to pay a visit to Madras but to visit the satyagrahis
at Vykom and if, after I have finished my work there, time is left
for me I do intend to pass a few days in Madras and renew my
acquaintance with you individually. (“Hear, hear!”) Meanwhile, I
ask you to respond to the request made from the chair that you should
pray for the success of the mission that awaits me in Vykom. I am
going to Vykom personally to tender my sympathy and support to the
devoted band of satyagrahis. I hope that they will allow me to wait</p>

Satyagraha not being a war of violence but being a war of conversion

For me the question of untouchability is a deeply religious question.
It is a matter of penance and purification on the part of those who
are not untouchables. It is a matter of essential reform in Hinduism.
If you will therefore out of deepest conviction pray for success to
my mission I want all these prayers of yours.</p>

I know that having come here you will expect me to say something on
the present situation that faces India, but you will not expect me to
speak upon what may be termed the political side of the question. I
am uninterested in it. Whilst it is an integral part of the Congress
organization, I have purposely refrained from interesting myself in
it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I have no aptitude for it, nor faith in it. But that does not by any
means mean that others need not or should not have faith in that
programme. My life’s work is chalked out for me. I know for certain
that if we can ensure reform from within, the other will follow as
day follows night. I am equally certain that no reform from without
can avail without reform from within. Every effort that might be made
in the Legislative Councils or in the Legislative Assembly, every
effort that might be made on your behalf in London, will be perfectly
fruitless. this is not said by way of criticism of those who are
taking part in that activity, but this is said in order to emphasize
the fact that you and I, the men in the street, have to look after
ourselves. This is said in order to emphasize the fact that if you
and I are to help the fruition of that programme, we must work from
within. What can your Councils do if Hindus and Mussalmans fly at one
another’s throats? What can the Councillors do on the Council floor
if we, the Hindus, ostracize a fifth of our own kith and kin? What
can they do if we will not identify ourselves with the down-trodden,
poverty-stricken masses of India by turning the wheel and wearing
khaddar? I am told times without number, in season and out of season,
that nothing can be done in this great country of ours unless there
is some excitement provided for the people. But please remember that
swaraj is not a product of excitement or intoxication. Swaraj will be
the natural and inevitable</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
result of business-like habits. It will be a natural and inevitable
result of co-operation among our own ranks, of exacting discipline
and obedience, and of sustained energy and willing, well-meant,
calculated sacrifice. It will be natural and inevitable result of
co-operative industry on the part of the whole nation. It will be the
natural and inevitable result of an enlightened awakening amongst the
masses of India. But half-a dozen or twenty cities of India along 
working together cannot bring swaraj. We who have attained a degree
of political consciousness and have begun to love our country for the
sake of it, must spread ourselves out amongst the masses and go back
to the villages.</p>

Of Hindu-Muslim unity you know what I have said in Bombay. Those of
you who know how to spin will understand the simile I am about to
give you. Indifferent spinners amongst you know how sometimes when
you are unwinding your yarn from the spindle it becomes sometimes a
tangle. You know the more you try to undo the tangle the more knotty
it becomes, and a wise spinner leaves his tangle aside for the moment
when he has lost his temper and approaches it after he has cooled
down. So it is with the Hindu-Muslim question. It has become a
hopeless tangle at the present moment. I thought I was an expert in
solving that tangle as I think I am also an expert in spinning. But
for the time being I have put away in my cupboard this Hindu-Muslim
tangle. That does not mean that I have despaired of a solution. My
mind will eternally work at it till I find out a solution. But I must
confess to you today that I cannot present a workable solution that
you will accept. In the atmosphere surcharged as it is with mutual
distrust I cannot persuade either the Hindus or the Mussalmans to
accept my solution. But for you I would like to leave this little
single thought that those of you who have to deal with Hindus or
Mussalmans as the case may be, be straightforward, honest and
fearless in your dealings with one another. In spite of the horizon
which is black before you, do not lose faith, be loving to one
another, remembering that the same Divine Spirit inhabits whether it
is the Hindu body or Muslim body and try to be charitable, one
towards the other.</p>

Of untouchability you know the exact position wihtout my having to
say a word. But I am aware, probably you will also agree, that we
have, during the last four years, made a tremendous advance in the
right direction. It is not enough, I know, for the purpose required;
but it is enough to fill us with the hope that within the present</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
generation the curse will be blotted out of Hinduism.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Last but not the least to mention remain the spinning-wheel and
khaddar. I know that even in that direction we have done something.
But it is sheer laziness and our ignorance that have left khaddar in
the position in which it stands today. There is no question here of
passion and prejudice as there is about the Hindu-Muslim problem.
There is no question of religious intolerance as there is about
untouchability. I have not yet met a single man who has told me that
it is against his conscience either to turn the spinning-wheel or to
wear khaddar, its product. It is the simplest A B C of economics that
millions of the masses of India who have at least four months of
idleness on their hands would be able to turn those four months to
good use if they had the spinning-wheels in their cottages. Whilst a
few pies per day may be nothing to you and to me, those few pies are
a heavensent gift to these masses. It must be a matter of ordinary
common sense to understand that if we would have our masses to spin
the charkha we must first of all learn the art that has all but died
out before we would take the message of hope to these cottages. You
will agree that it will be easy enough for a child to understand that
if the masses are to spin the charkha and weave khaddar, the classes
and masses together must use and wear khaddar, and I am sorry to have
to prophesy that if we have become so soft as not to be able to wear
coarse khaddar, remember that there is no swaraj for us in this
generation. Swaraj is a hardy tree of patient growth and therefore it
requires the patient toil of hardy men and women and you will have to
do what Elizabeth of old did for her own country. She prohibited the
import of soft cloth from Holland and herself wore and coarse cloth
that was woven for her in her own dear England and imposed that
obligation upon the whole of that nation. You need not go into the
complications about the question of khaddar and the spinning-wheel.
You need not bother your heads about the question whether it cannot
by itself bring swaraj. Let it be a simple but easy test for you and
for me. Are we or are we not ready to give half an hour to the nation
and spin away for all we are worth for the sake of the nation, for
the sake of identifying ourselves with the poorest in the land? Are
we or are we not ready to wear such cloth as may be spun and woven by
our sisters and  brothers? What is better, that we send away one anna
or two annas per yard of calico to Manchester or Ahmedabad or send
one anna or two annas to the cottages near Madras? Which is your
choice? Have you or have you not enough patriotism in yourselves to
think of your near</p>

I am patient by nature. But patient as I am, I grow impatient when
clever people talk to me all kinds of sophistries, when it is easy
enough for them to understand that one yard of khaddar bought by them
means at least two annas in the pockets of the poorest. I have no
other and better message for our land and if I am the only one
living, a solitary witness of the message, I must continue to deliver
that message so long as I have life in me.</p>

You want civil disobedience. I want it also. I know it is the only
substitute for an armed revolt. It is the real test of our strength.
But disobedience to be civil implies discipline, thought, care,
attention. Civil disobedience and excitement and intoxication go ill
together. And I know that without proper careful organization of the
spinning- wheel and khaddar, there is absolutely no civil
disobedience. As Lalaji well said, we may gain swaraj but we shall
not have the power to retain it. He said that on another occasion,
speaking on another subject; but that remark applies with equal, if
not greater force, in connection with civil disobedience.</p>

I found that the Rulers of Porbunder, Wankaner and Wadhwan enjoyed
the same popularity which I had noticed in the case of His Highness
the Thakore Saheb. Each of them seemed to desire the good of the
people. I was left with the impression that every one of them was
trying to satisfy his subjects. However, I must say one thing. I
found that in each State the Ruler’s expenses exceeded his income,
more or less. I am certain that a Ruler cannot justify his
guardianship so long as he does not cut down his expenses. He takes a
share of his subjects, earnings and offers his own services in
return. One whose services are indispensable becomes the leader. He
remains a true</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
leader only so long as he is loyal. A Ruler’s loyalty should mean
two things.On the one hand, he must protect the welfare, freedom and
virtue of his subjects and, on the other hand, he must put to good
use the revenues collected from them. If the Ruler spends money on
himself in an unbecoming manner, he is not utilizing the revenues
properly. He may certainly spend a little more than his subjects, he
may indulge in luxuries if he so wishes; there must, however, be a
limit to this. As one disinterested, I can clearly see that, in this
age of public awakening, such a limit is entirely essential. No
institution  which cannot prove its utility for the people will be
able to survive long. Having observed, as much as I could in a week,
four States in Kathiawar, I did find some justification for my
defence of the form of Government existing there; along with this,
however, its weaknesses also became apparent to me. As a well-wisher
of the Rulers, I would humbly request them voluntarily to introduce
the above changes, for, if they do so, not only will they gain more
popularity but will enhance the prestige of their thrones. He who
sets limits to his own authority, is the real Ruler. God has Himself
set limits to His own power, and in spite of having the capacity of
misuse that power, He does not do so. Anyone who, despite the
capacity to subsist physically, renounces that capacity attains 
<i>moksha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. The   perfect  <i>brahmachari</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>,  by  voluntarily conserving his energies, reaches such
a state that finally he becomes, as it were, impotent. That state is
beyond description. It is beyond all duality. Though he appears
corporeal, he is pure and immutable  spirit. That is why the English
maxim says: “The king can do no wrong.” The author of the
<i>Bhagavata </i>says that the Radiant One can do no wrong. Tulsidas
remarked in his sweet Hindi: “Oh holy man! The Mighty can have no
faults.” In our age, all these three maxims are being
misinterpreted; and it is believed and said that the powerful one
even though he commits an offence cannot be guilty. The very opposite
is true. He alone is strong who never misuses his strength and
voluntarily renounces the misuse of his strength, so much so that he
becomes incapable of such misuse. Why cannot our Rulers become so? Is
it beyond their powers?</p>

teachers’ character, their patriotism, their readiness for
sacrifice and their determination. I am envious in a good-humoured
way of the buildings of both the  schools.  These would prove a boon
if austere teachers dwell there, otherwise they may bring about our
downfall. In Burma there was a time when in every town sadhus taught
diligently in good schools housed in good buildings. The buildings
today are the same. However, when I visited those schools I found
sleepy, indolent sadhus there. The schools existed merely in name.
They had lost their souls. Just as admission of <i>Antyajas </i>is an
essential aspect of national schools, so is the spinning- wheel. On
the regular turning of that wheel depends the turn of the wheel of
India’s fortunes. The full development of the wheel is possible
only through  national schools. I look forward to its deification in
every school. The teachers’ service to the country will be measured
by their ability to inculcate respect for it. The spinning- wheel is
the only means for energizing this country which is slumbering in
idleness. As the wheel calls for disinterested labour, it yields the
greatest reward; and it is beautiful work. It may at first appear
monotonous, however; there is music in that monotony. It is for the
teachers to train the ear for this music. I hope that both these
schools will become perfect models.</p>

I appeal to the citizens of Rajkot and Wadhwan to take interest in
their schools. My appeal is especially directed to the citizens of
the latter. There was some bitterness at Wadhwan between Acharya
Fulchand and the citizens. I deliberately sought an occasion to
understand this matter. I met those gentlemen who had some
complaints. As a result of this, I came to the conclusion that there
was no cause for complaint unless it be Shri Fulchand’s temper. The</p>

citizens have a prominent role under the new  arrangements. The
school belongs to them. It is desirable that they take part in its
activities with enthusiasm. It is their duty to take such part. They
did so once and they also contributed funds. Everyone said that had
Shri Shivlal been alive Wadhwan would have shone out uniquely. All
men, however, are mortal. We may, if we choose, immortalize those
whom we love. Why cannot many wise citizens of Wadhwan become
Shivlals? It is not too much to hope that the wealthy citizens of the
town will take it upon themselves to finance the school. While the
teachers are the souls of such institutions, the citizens should
become the bodies.</p>

The technical school for spinning and weaving founded at Wadhwan by
Shri Shivlal is also remarkable. A fair amount of propagation of
khadi has been carried out by that school. However, I consider it
insufficient in view of the potentialities of the villages around
Wadhwan. On the principle that where nothing has been done all round,
even a little effort shines out, Wadhwan may be deemed to have done
well. However, we cannot rest satisfied with a little. The real
question is whether Wadhwan has done all that it could. I have said
already that its capacity is great. The technical school is a solid
memorial to Shri Shivlal. The spinning-wheel was his life’s work. I
was told that he had fully understood its significance. I hope that
all aspects of the art of the spinning-wheel will be developed in
Wadhwan.</p>

Today, there are three springs of khadi in Kathiawar— Wadhwan,
Madhada and Amreli. The organizing committee has drawn up plans to
produce more khadi. However, it is desirable that these three centres
should exchange their experience and enter into a  healthy
competition with one another. All the three centres can multiply the
production of khadi. There is every hope that khadi will get
encouragement from the States. Hence these centres should not falter
in producing khadi. Proper steps should be taken incessantly for the
propagation of khadi amongst the people. The organizing committee is
primarily responsible for this. I wish that this committee should buy
up all the khadi that is left over and stock it. It should take over
the monopoly of khadi. What is practised by the rich in America in
order to increase their wealth should be practised by us for the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
good of the people. In order to gain control over a certain business,
they buy up the entire stock of that article and then sell it at any
price they choose. Why should we not do the same for khadi in the
interest of the people? In America, such monopoly is practised in
order to raise prices. We shall do so in order to bring down prices.
The cost of producing khadi varies at different places because there
is some variation in the cost of spinning, etc. Moreover, we are
seeking gifts of cotton. This is in a way a bounty or encouragement
for  khadi. Because of this, the committee can afford to sell khadi
at a loss, whereas private organizations usually cannot do this. The
former can add up the different charges, then add to it the cost of
cotton received by way of gift, and then sell khadi at the price
arrived at. The rate at which private organizations are to be paid
can be fixed by talking the matter over with the organizations
concerned. They should, however, bear the following in mind.</p>

This task can be achieved only when everyone works diligently,
honestly and in mutual trust. We are faced with many difficulties
because we have not developed either the enthusiasm or the ability to
team together for public service. These organizations can keep away
from all these shortcomings because their workers have a well-
developed sense of public service. They are imbued with a missionary
spirit and have had some experience too. They might not have learnt
how to work harmoniously together and to tolerate different
temperaments. Where the motives are good, experience alone will
overcome the shortcomings.</p>

opportunity for testing [the progress of spinning]. I had hoped to
get  a good spinning-wheel in Rajkot, at any rate. However, I would
by no means call it good. A good spinning-wheel is one the tape,
belt, etc., of which are of the best quality, and its spindle is
neither thin nor bent. I do not think that it passed all these tests.
However, what I found intolerable was the dust that had gathered on
the spinning-wheel. A workman always keeps his tools in the best
shape. Why should the wheel gather dust? In Jetpur the very limit was
reached. Devchandbhai hastily promised that he had an excellent
spinning-wheel which he would send immediately. He had taken me to
Jetpur by car. It was eleven o’clock at night but how could I go to
sleep without spinning? The spinning-wheel duly arrived, but why
should it work at all? The spindle worked was if it was the guest of
the Girnar mountain, the tape consisted of yarn wrapped anyhow, the
belt, a mere string. Ordinarily, my arm does not ache when I work on
the spinning-wheel but this time I had to turn the wheel so hard that
within half an hour my arm was tired. Such was Devchandbhai’s fine
spinning-wheel. After this bitter experience, it appeared as if
Devchandbhai had called the public meeting in order to mock at the
spinning-wheel. I did not spare the wheel nor its owner my rebuke at
the meeting. However, in the light of the aforesaid misinterpretation
of the maxim, namely, the powerful are blameless, who would put the
blame on Devchandbhai’s spinning- wheel? After all, he was the
secretary. He himself was convinced that his spinning-wheel could not
possibly be faulty. I would, therefore, like to make it publicly
known that if Devchandbhai does not immediately set right his
spinning-wheel, he will be removed from office.</p>

However, as the sting is merely that of conscience, it will be wel-
comed even though it hurts. It is difficult to get a pure and upright
secretary like Devchandbhai. We should make the best use of him that
we could. Where the subjects slumber, the king cannot be awake. How
could Devchandbhai be vigilant when all of us are negligent ? He has
understood the significance of the spinning-wheel but he did  not
repair or adorn it because of the slackness all around him. If he was
devoted only to the spinning-wheel, the imperfection in his wheel
would be unforgivable. I was a little less dissatisfied with
Porbandar. The same could be said of Wankaner. This imperfection gave
me an idea of the progress of the spinning-wheel in Kathiawar. The
wheel has not yet secured the place of honour which it deserves. It

If work is done systematically in this manner, a great improvement
will be noticed within a short time in the spinning wheel and its
yarn output. I found that whereas I can easily turn out a hundred
yards of yarn on my spinning-wheel, on these other wheels I could
hardly spin fifty. Moreover, except in Rajkot nowhere else did I
experience the pleasure that one has while plying a good spinning-
wheel. Before the end of this year, not only should khadi gain a firm
foothold in Kathiawar, but we should acquire such skill as to be able
to weave fine saris. I found that Yashodabehn had had hand-spun
dhotis woven for her husband, Dahyabhai. These could compete with the
fine dhotis made in Andhra. Why cannot hundreds of men and women spin
such fine yarn?</p>

The division of labour agreed to at the time of the conference was as
follows—the people should spin, wear khadi, and I should take care
of political matters. I have already explained its implications, yet
it is necessary to explain them again. This is what it means. Just as
the people must actively fulfil their own pledge, similarly I too
must be alert and fulfil mine. The people can, by being vigilant,
fulfil their pledge and succeed therein. This is because the key to
success is in</p>

their own hands. It is possible that, in spite of my vigilance and in
spite of fulfilling my pledge, I may not succeed, because my success
depends on others. Moreover, my success too is dependent on the
people’s fulfilment of their pledge. It is sad that it should still
be necessary to explain how politics is linked with yarn. The
collective strength of the people lies in spinning yarn. I am
convinced that its invisible power will influence everything. Whether
this is true or not, it is necessary that the people realize the
implication of my pledge. There is no guarantee that I will indeed be
able to achieve something. I have only pointed out to the people the
path which I consider the best. A nation cannot achieve anything
through demonstrations alone. We should also understand the situation
of the Rulers. Our purpose is not served by mere condemnation or
criticism. In order to understand this situation, I advised the
conference to refrain from passing resolutions on political matters.
I have pledged myself to examine the matter as thoroughly as possible
in my capacity as the president. I am striving to fulfil the pledge.
I am not reclining at ease, nor shall I do so. However, this does not
mean that those who are suffering should seek no remedy. My advice
merely means that the conference can assist in the above manner. It
should be clearly understood that I am in no way opposed to people
adopting whatever truthful and peaceful means they prefer to redress
their grievances. The conference should give all possible assistance.
At the moment, that assistance has taken the form of my using all my
powers of persuasion with those States against which complaints have
been made. Success depends on the purity of the issue and the persons
concerned and on the people’s fulfilment of their own pledge. The
people too must create an impression by their vigilant work. They
will gain self-confidence if they preserve their self-respect by
means of constructive work. Today, the people of Kathiawar, like
those elsewhere, have lost their self- respect. My experience
suggests that in many States of Kathiawar, the conditions are such
that the people can make as much progress as they wish. Some
facilities that are absent in British India are available to the
people of the States of Kathiawar. The people can take full advantage
of these only by engaging themselves in constructive work.</p>

it again in April. I had to see the <i>Antyaja </i>school at Botad,

different places should arrange my April programme in consultation
with Devchandbhai and the Amreli office. I hope that no one will wish
to take me to a single place where khadi is not the attraction. I
expect to see a large number of members enrolled in April. I also
hope that cotton which was promised has already been collected and
more promises secured; and lastly, those centres which were to be
opened under the Rajkot resolution have started working.</p>

This feeling is understandable. Anyone who has worn khadi spun by
himself and woven by himself or others can realize the value of the
pearl-like tears which have fallen from this sister’s eyes. A
certain gentleman had lost a towel made of self-spun yarn. He was
restless with anxiety so long as it was not traced. We attach no
value to   a match-stick or a pin but what would be our attitude if
we had made it ourselves? The same sweetness and sentiment that one
sees in food cooked by oneself one also finds in hand-spun,
hand-woven khadi.</p>

Sumant Mehta. There is truth in both these view-points. It would be
good if both were put into practice. However, we do not always have
the strength to do everything that is good. Experience alone will
determine the ultimate shape of education. It is not our indifference
to chemistry and other such subjects but rather lack of equipment
which is responsible for our not teaching them at the moment. It is
for this very reason that only the most important things have been
accommodated. The spinning-wheel is the symbol of industry. When it
is firmly established in its proper place, the sciences and crafts of
the blacksmith, the carpenter and others will automatically find a
place. There is no doubt that our efforts should be to meet the needs
of all the four castes. I can see that we are making progress in that
direction. If all educationists who put their faith in national
education continue the work assigned to them with faith and courage,
the desired changes will come about of their own accord. Where the
intention is honest, success is inevitable. I observed during my tour
that people are prepared, or almost anxious, to contribute funds for
these activities, but we have a dearth of men with conviction and
competence.</p>

for ever. But I am afraid I am unable to pay you the same tribute so
far as the spinning-wheel is concerned. I took the oppor-tunity, in
replying to the address of the Madras Corporation, of mentioning the
fact that no municipality’s work in India can be considered to be
complete until that municipality had identified itself with the
lowest of its citizens. One often learns that the order is really
reversed, that is to say, the municipalities give to those who have
much and take away much from those who have very little. They care
more for the rich and the powerful and little or less for the poor
and down-trodden. (“Hear, hear.”) I hope that it is not true of
this town and that you are observing the proper order of things. I
therefore suggest the spinning- wheel only by way of addition. It is
to me a symbol of inseparable connection between the rich and the
poor. It is the one certain definite solution for the poverty of the
masses of India. I ask you therefore to introduce the spinning-wheel
in your schools and also its product, khaddar. I ask you to give it a
sacred place in your homes as it occupied years and years ago. I have
not hesitated to call it one of the <i>yajnas </i>of this age and as
the great ones do, so do the lower order of beings follow. You will
not therefore be able success-fully to carry the message of the
spinning-wheel to the humble homes of India, unless you adopt it
yourselves. May you have the courage and the strength and the
goodwill to follow the advice that I have humbly tendered to you!</p>

	necessary for me to stay here before proceeding there. I know that
	yours is a historic city. It is full of all kinds of vivid
	recollections, not all of them of a pleasant type. Living on the
	seaside you are aware of what adventure can do. The sea is an
	epitome of adventures. At the present moment, however, I am not
	concerned with the adventures that the sea offers. What we need is

	have made but little progress towards our</p>

goal, it is because the spirit of adventure is absent from us. It
requires for instance an adventurous spirit to find out in the Hindu
religion its black spots. Those who are not fired with that spirit
are satisfied with things as they are. They do not stop to enquire
whether they are good or bad; but ever since I have been in India,
after my sojourn in South Africa for a period of nearly 20 years, I
have been telling the Hindus that we have in our religion a black
spot which must be removed. It is untouchability and here I am sorry
to add also unapproachability. I have not come in order to argue with
the orthodox people. I have come with a message of peace. I want to
plead wisdom and tell them that this untouchability and
unapproacha-bility cannot be part of Hinduism. I have come to tell
them that the satyagrahis who are fighting against enormous odds at
Vykom are not out to destroy religion, but to reform it. I have come
to tell them of all the implications of this struggle. I have come to
tell them also that it is wrong for us to be satisfied with things as
they are, if we find that they are bad. It, therefore, gives me
pleasure that I shall be carrying with me your blessings and your
sympathy, for in the address presented to me on your behalf by the
municipality I am assured of  your  sympathy and support. I want you
also to carry the same spirit a little further and I want you to find
with me that one of the most potent causes of the ever-deepening
poverty of the masses is that they have nothing to do for nearly a
third part of the year throughout India. I would like you to discover
with me that if we give them the spinning- wheel which had a place in
every home in India only a hundred years ago, they will find enough
to occupy themselves during their leisure hours. But the introduction
of the spinning-wheel in the millions of our homes will be a
perfectly useless thing if we do not discard the use of foreign cloth
or mill-made cloth.</p>

In going about, therefore, from place to place I am pleading with
those men and women whom I see that it is their bounden duty to
discard the use of foreign cloth and mill-made cloth and replace it
with hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar. For you in Malabar plenty of
clothing is a burden. I have no doubt that I am an object of envy
with most of you. In this weather of ours the least we have in the
shape of clothing the better it is from every point of view. I wish
you will not run away with the idea that dignity or civilization
requires multipli-</p>

cation of clothing. (Laughter and “hear, hear!”) “Handsome is
not who is handsome clothed, but handsome is who handsome does.”
The truest test of civilization, culture and dignity is character and
not clothing. I feel overwhelmed with sorrow whenever I find the
people in India telling me that they have outgrown khaddar and that
it is impossible for them to return to the savage days when our
ancestors were satisfied with khaddar clothing. I would like you to
answer with me the critics who think in that way, that the best way
of ridding India of the curse of poverty and pauperism is for one and
all of us to be dressed in khaddar. Those of you who will go in for
fineries and fineness, it is possible for you to get as fine a
hand-spun yarn as you wish to. I hope therefore that you will tax
yourselves, tax your minds and dot every home in Cochin with the
spinning-wheel and see to it that everyone in Cochin uses khaddar and
nothing else.</p>

I need say nothing about the Hindu-Muslim question. I know that you
miss the presence of one of the Ali Brothers. It has been usual for
one of them to be touring with me throughout India. But it was not
possible to do so this time. But I wish to congratulate you on the
freedom from this taxing problem in your midst. It is a matter of
great pleasure to me to find that all the communities belonging to
the different religions are living in a spirit of goodwill and
brother-hood in this State. I wish that we could in every part of
India copy your worthy examples. May God give you the strength and
the wisdom to introduce khaddar and the spinning-wheel in your homes
and to rid Hinduism of the curse of untouchability! May all the races
inhabiting this fair land remain for ever united as they are today!</p>

seen you and heard you. Having heard you, it seems to me that in so
far as the present <i>brahmacharis </i>are concerned, if the parents
of the Brahmin boys insist on their boys being allowed to dine
separately, their scruples should be respected. But, for the future,
it may be announced that no <i>brahmacharis </i>would be accepted
whose parents would not let their boys dine in the same row with the
others. I understand from you that the cook at the Gurukul would be
always a Brahmin. What you object to (and that properly) is the
separating of non-Brahmin boys from the Brahmins. I do think that all
the boys should sit in the same row whilst they are taking their
meals.</p>

	I know you will excuse me for not standing up to speak to you, and I
	hope you will also excuse me for being a few minutes late. I can
	only give you my assurance that my being late was due to no delay on
	my part. I have been occupied the whole day long with the mission
	that has brought me here. It gives me very great pleasure to see
	such a large assembly here, because it enables me to tell you the
	purpose of my mission.</p>

	At the outset, however, I wish to thank all those who presented me
	with addresses yesterday; at the time the address was presented, a
	letter was delivered into my hands protesting against that address
	and assuring me that it did not represent the sentiments of all the
	people in Vykom (“Shame!”). I gladly accept that protest and
	inform you of it. The very fact of the letter having been signed by
	a few gentlemen shows at least that they were not in sympathy with
	the address or rather the wording of it. Nor does it surprise me
	that the address did not carry the consent of all the people of
	Vykom. I know that you are unfortunately divided here over a very
	vital question. So far as I am concerned, I would be happier without
	any address whatsoever, but when I do receive addresses, they give
	me a topic of conversation with the meetings which I address and
	this address does show that in a most particular manner. I thank
	those who have pres-ented me with the address this evening also.
	That too deals with the subject that has brought me here and that is
	the subject of untouch-ability and unapproachability and the method,
	namely, satyagraha, adopted in Vykom in order to rid this place of
	unapproachability in a particular way. As you are aware, that
	struggle from its very inception has commanded my deep admiration
	and sympathy. It is possible that the conductors of satyagraha may
	have made mistakes in the campaign. Who is there in the world who is
	infallible? But I am satisfied that the mistakes, if any were
	committed, were not deliberate. Satyagraha, like the name itself, is
	a somewhat new doctrine, or rather a new presentation of an old
	doctrine.</p>

position taken up by the satyagrahis at Vykom is that the roads that
pass by the great temple should be open to those who are considered
to be untouchables or unapproachables. The claim is based upon
humanity itself. Any road which is open to the public, so  far  as
Hindus are concerned, any road that is open to those who are caste
Hindus, should and does claim to be open to those who are thrown out
of caste and considered untouchables or unapproachables. In my humble
opinion, it is a natural and just claim. As you know, ever since I
set my foot on Indian soil after a long exile in South Africa, I have
been speaking frankly, fearlessly and freely on the question of
untouchability. I claim to be a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu. I claim to
know sufficient of the Shastras for my own purpose and I venture to
suggest that untouchability and unapproachability, as they are
practised in this holy land of ours, have no place or sanction in the
Hindu Shastras. (“Hear, hear”, and cheers.) Neither approve nor
disapprove, but simply listen to my remarks. I venture to suggest to
those who are professors of Hinduism, who hold Hinduism as dear as
life itself, that Hinduism like every other religion, apart from the
sanction  of  Shastras, has got to submit itself to the test of
universal reason.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In this age of reason, in this age of universal knowledge, in this
age of education and comparative theology, any religion which
entrenches itself behind Shastric injunctions and authority is, in my
own humble opinion, bound to fail. In my opinion, untouchability is a
blot upon humanity and therefore upon Hinduism. It cannot stand the
test of reason. It is in conflict with the fundamental precepts of
Hinduism. The first among the three principles I am about to
enunciate of Hinduism is <i>Satyannast</i><i>i</i><i> </i><i>par</i><i>o</i><i>
</i><i>dharmah</i><i>,</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>i.e.,
there is no religion other than or higher than truth. The second is 
<i>Ahimsa  </i><i>paramo </i><i>dharmah </i>and if ahimsa, meaning
love, non-violence, is the law of life, is the greatest religion, is
the only religion, then I suggest to you that untouchability is in
direct conflict with that truth. The third is that God alone is Truth
and everything else is transitory and illusory. If it is so, I
suggest to you that it is impossible for us to reconcile
untouchability and unapp-roachability with the grand doctrine. I have
come, therefore, to reason with my orthodox friends.  I have come to
plead with them, and by their courtesy and goodwill. I was able to
wait upon them this afternoon. They gave me a patient hearing and
listened to me. We argued, I appealed to their reason, I appealed to
their humanity, I appealed to the Hinduism in them. I am</p>

believe in God, as I believe in the fact that we are all met here
together and as I believe also in humanity, because I see that in
spite of all our differences, all our quarrels, humanity lives on, I

I have made three sporting offers to these friends of mine. In the
name and on behalf of the satyagrahis of Vykom, those offers are
binding on me, but I have left them free to reject or accept them. I
have pleaded with them that they should accept these offers even
though it may be by way of trial. I have not hesitated to enter into
such unilateral contract because I believe in the truth that I
implicitly believe and stand for. For I have come not to precipitate
and enhance the quarrel, but to bring about peace and goodwill
between the orthodox section and those who are today trying to act in
the name of humanity and justice. Though I may seem at times to be
fighting, my purpose is never to fight, nor have I undertaken a fight
to prolong it, but to bring about peace at the shortest possible
notice. An English friend when I embarked upon non-co-operation, told
me that my non-co-operation was only skin-deep but that I was pining
for co- operation. I immediately closed with him and I told him that
he had read my heart correctly, and so it is with my orthodox
friends, I assure them. Satyagraha is there, but to be called off as
soon as they wish it, it  is for them to make a sporting offer and it
will be accepted, only let them beware of murdering truth. A
satyagrahi has always his minimum and it is the minimum that is
wanted in connection with this struggle. The right of way is such a
reasonable demand that it has only to be asked to be given. Let it be
understood, therefore, that there is no mental reservation behind
this struggle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.07cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 95%">
I have repeatedly told the Hindus of India what the removal of
untouchability means to me and  to  those  who  are  today  en- gaged
 in  that  holy  campaign.  It   does   not   mean   the   breaking
up of <i>Varnashrama dharma</i>. It does not mean inter-dining or
inter marriages. But it does mean the common relations between man
and man that should exist in any civilized society. It does mean that
places of worship should be open if they are at all open to anybody,
to all those who are considered Hindus. But I grant that if there is
a</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
particular class, say, Brahmins, who want to build temples and
exclude non-Brahmins from them. I say that it is their right to do
so. But if there is a temple which is open to non-Brahmins also, then
there is no such thing as a fifth caste which may be put out of that
temple. I see no warrant for such an exclusion in the Hindu Shastras.
Similarly I claim that public places such as schools should be open
alike to the untouchables, if they are open to other classes. So
would it be with watering places such as wells, lakes and rivers.
That is the whole of my claim on behalf of those who are engaged in
this campaign against untouchability and unapproachability.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
Let me, however, clear the position a little so far as Vykom is
concerned. The present satyagraha is merely directed towards
vindicating the right of the unapproachables to pass through the
roads through which Christians and Mussalmans and caste Hindus are
entitled to pass. Satyagrahis today are not fighting for entry into
temples. They are not fighting—I do not know if there is any
prohibition in the schools of Travancore—they are not fighting for
admission in the schools, not that such is not their claim. But I am
presenting you today the implications of the present struggle. Since
satyagraha is a method of conversion and conviction, it seeks never
to use the slightest coercion. I therefore gladly endorse in its
entirety the remarks made by the Dewan Sahib in his address<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
the Travancore Assembly, and if I find the satyagrahis in Vykom in
denial of their own faith use violence or any other method in order
to put undue pressure upon the orthodox Hindus of Vykom, you will
find me, on proof given to me, entirely dissociating myself from
those satyagrahis so-called. But so long as satyagrahis keep within
the terms of their contract, so long shall I consider it to be my
bounden duty to give them all the assistance that a single, humble
individual is capable of giving. I plead, therefore, with all the
force at my command that the orthodox Brahmins and non-Brahmins of
Vykom who may be opposed to this campaign study it in all its
bearings, to apply their reason to bear upon the struggle and stand
for justice and humanity; if they find that this struggle is just and
the means adopted by the satyagrahis to vindicate the right of
humanity are also fair, reasonable and non-violent.</p>

Time is always on the side of those who will wait upon it. Public
opinion, I hope, even of Vykom, is on their side. Public opinion
outside Vykom, I know, is on their side. The world opinion is growing
strong on their side and if the satyagrahis will only play the game
well, have patience and will be able to endure silent and slow
sufferings, I have no doubt that victory is theirs. The Government of
Travancore, so far as I can see from the address of the Dewan Sahib,
has held the scales evenly between the two parties. I know that my
satyagrahi  friends here shook their heads when I told them that the
presentation by the Dewan was not open to exception. Whatever the
truth may be, there is no doubt about it that the credit will be
yours if the two sections of the community meet together and find a
reasonable and honourable solution for the difficulty without the
intervention of the Government. The Dewan himself, so far as his own
opinion is concerned, has told the orthodox people where his opinion
lies. He invites them to march with the times, to recognize the time
spirit. I hope my orthodox friends will listen to the sound advice
given by him. In any event, I give them my best assurance that no
matter what they think of it, no matter how they behave, whether they
accept my offers or reject them, I shall only do according to the
behests of the Hindu religion as I know it. I recognize no one as my
enemy on the face of the earth. I shall, therefore, love them in
spite of differences between them and myself. I shall ever pray to
God that he may guide their steps in the right direction, open the
eyes of their understanding, open their eyes to the writing on the
wall and render justice to these down-trodden countrymen of ours. I
am humble enough also to pray to God at the same time that if I have
misread the Hindu Shastras, if I have misread humanity, and have
erred in giving the advice that I have tendered to the satyagrahis,
He will open my eyes also, show me my error and give me strength and
the necessary courage to acknowledge my error and apologize to my
orthodox friends.</p>

unity. You have in this connection much to teach to the rest of

perfect harmony and friendship in Travancore. I hope that the rest of
India will copy the admirable spirit which actuates you. I thank you

But I want to tell you as briefly as I can what I expect of you. I
would ask you to forget the political aspect of the programme.
Political consequences of this struggle there are, but you are not to
concern yourselves with them. If you do, you will miss the true
result and also miss the political consequences, and when the real
heat of the struggle is touched you will be found wanting. I am
therefore anxious, even if it frightens you, to explain to you the
true nature of the struggle. It is a struggle deeply religious for
the Hindus. We are endeavouring to rid Hinduism of its greatest blot.
The prejudice we have to fight against is an age-long prejudice. The
struggle for the opening of the roads round the temple which we hold
to be public to the unapproachables is but a small skirmish in the
big battle. If our struggle was to end with the opening of the roads
in Vykom you may be sure I would not have bothered my head about it.
If therefore you think that the struggle is to end with opening of
the roads in Vykom to the unapproachables you are mistaken. The road
must be opened. It has got to be opened. But that will be the
beginning of the end. The end is to get all such roads throughout
Travancore to be opened to the unapproachables; and not only that,
but we expect that our efforts may result in amelioration of the
general condition of the untou- chables and unapproachables. That
will require tremendous sacrifice. For our aim is not to do things by
violence to opponents. That will be con-version by violence or
compulsion, and if we import compulsion in matters of religion, there
is no doubt that we shall be committing sui-cide. We should carry on
this struggle on the lines of strict non- violence, i.e., by
suffering in our own persons. That is the meaning of satyagraha. The
question is whether you are capable of every suffering that may be
imposed upon you or may be your lot in the journey towards the goal.
Even whilst you are suffering, you may have no bitterness—no trace
of it—against your opponents. And I tell you it is not a mechanical
act at all. On the contrary I want you to feel like loving your
opponents and the way to do it is to give them the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
same credit for honesty of purpose which you would claim for
yourself. I know that it is a difficult task. I confess that it was a
difficult task for me yesterday whilst I was talking to those friends
who insisted on their right to exclude the unapproachables from the
temple roads. I confess there was selfishness behind their talk. How
then was I to credit them with honesty of purpose? I was thinking of
this thing yesterday and also this morning, and this is what I did. I
asked myself: “Wherein was their selfishness or self interest? It
is true that they have their ends to serve. But so have we our ends
to serve. Only we consider our ends to be pure and therefore
selfless. But who is to determine where selflessness ends and
selfishness begins. Selflessness may be the purest form of
selfishness”. I do not say this for the sake of argument. But that
is what I really feel. I am considering their condition of mind from
their point of view and not my own. Had they not been Hindu they
would not have talked as they did yesterday. And immediately we begin
to think of things as our opponents think of them we shall be able to
do them full justice. I know that this requires a detached state of
mind, and it is a state very difficult to reach. Nevertheless for a
satyagrahi it is absolutely essential. Three fourths of the miseries
and misunderstandings in the world will disappear, if we step into
the shoes of our adversaries and understand their standpoint. We will
then agree with our adversaries quickly or think of them charitably.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
In our case there is no question of our agreeing with them quickly as
our ideals are radically different. But we may be charitable to them
and believe that they actually mean what they say. They do not want
to open the roads to the unapproachables. Now whether it is their
self-interest or ignorance that tells them to say so, we really
believe that it is wrong of them to say so. Our business therefore is
to show them that they are in the wrong and we should do so by our
suffering. I have found that mere appeal to reason does not answer
where prejudices are age-long and based on supposed religious
authority. Reason has to be strengthened by suffering and suffering
opens the eyes of understanding. Therefore there must be no trace of
compulsion in our acts. We must not be impatient, and we must have an
undying faith in the means we are adopting. The means we are adopting
just now are that we approach the four barricades and as we are
stopped there we sit down and spin away from day to day, and we must
believe that through it the roads must be opened. I know that it is 
a difficult and slow process. But if you believe in the efficacy of</p>

satyagraha you will rejoice in this slow torture and suffering, and
you will not feel the discomfort of your position as you go and sit
in the boiling sun from day to day. If you have faith in the cause
and the means and in God the hot sun will be cool for you. You must
not be tired and say “how long”, and never get irritated. That is
only a small portion of your penance for the sin for which Hinduism
is responsible.</p>

I regard you as soldiers in this campaign. It is not possible for you
to reason out things for yourselves. You have  come to  the Ashram
because you have faith in the management . That does not mean faith
in me. For I am not manager. I am directing the movement so far as
ideals and general direction are concerned. Your faith therefore must
be in those who are managers for the time being. The choice before
coming to the Ashram was yours. But having made your choice and come
to the Ashram it is not for you to reason why. If we are to become a
powerful nation you must obey all directions that may be given to you
from time to time. That is the only way in which either political or
religious life can be built up. You must have determined for
yourselves certain principles and you must have joined the struggle
in obedience to those principles. Those who remain in the Ashram are
taking as much part in the struggle as those who go and offer
satyagraha at the barricades. Every piece of work in connection with
the struggle is just as important as any other piece, and therefore
the work of sanitation in the Ashram is just as important as spinning
away at the barricades. And if in this place the work of cleaning the
closets and compound is more distasteful than spinning it should be
considered far more important and profitable. Not a single minute
should be wasted in idle conversation, but we must be absorbed in the
work before us and if everyone of us works in that spirit you will
see that there is pleasure in the work itself. Every bit of property,
anything in the Ashram, should be regarded by you as your own
property and not property that can be wasted at pleasure. You may not
waste a grain of rice or a scrap of paper, and similarly a minute of
your time. It is not ours. It belongs to the nation and we are
trustees for the use of it.</p>

lazy as a nation, we have lost the time sense. Selfishness dominates
our action. There is mutual jealousy amongst the tallest of us. We
are uncharitable to one another. And if I did not draw your attention
to the things I have, it will not be possible for us to rid ourselves
of all these evils. Satyagraha is a relentless search for truth and a
determination to search truth. I can only hope you will realize the
import of what you are doing. And if you do, your path will be
easy—easy because you will take delight in difficulties and you
will laugh in hope when everybody is in despair. I believe in  the

away whilst he was being drowned in the boiling oil. For to him it
was greater torture to forget his Maker than to be in boiling oil.

Sudhanva’s faith in this struggle.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

1921. National education to be truly national must reflect the
national condition for the time being. And as the national condition
at present is one of uncertainty national education too must remain
in a more or less uncertain condition. How do children fare in a
besieged place? Do they not according to their capacity take part in
repelling the attack of the besiegers and suit themselves to the
changing circumst- ances? Is that not their true education? Is not
education the art of drawing out full manhood of the children under
training? The greatest drawback of the present system of education is
that it does not bear the stamp of reality, that the children do not
react to the varying wants of the country. True education must
correspond to the surrounding circumstances or it is not a healthy
growth. The necessity of this response was the object of
non-co-operation in  education. True, we have not acted up to the
ideal. That is because of our limitations, because we are unable to
shake off the hypnotic effect of our surroundings.</p>

education. I  do  not  aim  at  taking  the  whole  of the 
childrens’  time for this purpose. Like a skilled physician I tend
and  con- centrate my attention on the diseased limb knowing that
that is the best way of looking after the others. I would develop in
the  child his hands, his brain and his soul. The hands have almost
atrophied. The soul has been altogether ignored. I therefore put in a
plea in season and out of season for correcting these grave defects
in our education. Is half an hour’s spinning every day by our
children too great a strain upon them? Will it result in mental
paralysis?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I value education in the different sciences. Our children cannot have
too much of chemistry and physics. And if these have not been
attended to in the institutions in which I am directly supposed to be
interested, it is because we have not the professors for the purpose
and also because practical training in these sciences requires very
expensive laboratories for which in the present state of uncertainty
and infancy we are not ready.</p>

surgical instruments from England, pins and pencils from Austria and

inhabitants of India. I hold it to be sinful for me [not] to buy the
cloth spun and woven by the needy millions of India’s paupers and
to buy foreign cloth, although it may be superior in quality to the
Indian hand-spun. My swadeshi therefore chiefly centres round the
hand- spun khaddar and extends to every thing that can be and is
produced in India. My nationalism is as broad as my swadeshi. I want
India’s rise so that the whole world may benefit. I do not want
India to rise on the ruin of other nations. If therefore India was
strong and able, India would send out to the world her treasures of
art and health-giving spices, but will refuse to send out opium or
intoxicating liquors although the traffic may bring much material

It is not without the greatest hesitation and reluctance that I
approach the subject. The question of using artificial methods for
birth- control has been referred to me by correspondents ever since
my return to India. Though I have answered them personally, I have
never hitherto dealt with the subject publicly. My attention was
drawn to the subject, now thirty-five years ago, when I was a student
in England. There was then a hot controversy raging between a purist
who would not countenance anything but natural means and a doctor who
advocated artificial means. It was at that early time in my life that
I became, after leanings for a brief period towards artificial means,
a convinced opponent of them. I now observe that in some Hindi papers
the methods are described in a revoltingly open manner which shocks
one’s sense of decency. I observe, too, that one writer  does  not
hesitate to cite my name as among the supporters of artificial
methods of birth-control. I cannot recall a single occasion when I
spoke or wrote in favour of such methods. I have seen also two
distinguished names having been used in support. I hesitate to
publish them without reference to their owners.</p>

control. But the only method handed down from ages past is self-
control or <i>brahmacharya</i>. It is an infallible sovereign remedy
doing good to those who practise it. And medical men will earn the
gratitude of mankind, if instead of devising artificial means of
birth-control they will find out the means of self-control. The union
is meant not for pleasure but for bringing forth progeny. And union
is a crime when the desire for progeny is absent.</p>

Artificial methods are like putting a premium upon vice. They make
men and women reckless. And respectability that is being given to the
methods must hasten the dissolution of the restraints that public
opinion puts upon one. Adoption of artificial methods must result in
imbecility and nervous prostration. The remedy will be found to be
worse than the disease. It is wrong and immoral to seek to escape the
consequences of one’s acts. It is good for a person who overeats to
have an ache and a fast. It is bad for him to indulge his appetite
and then escape the consequence by taking tonics or other medicine.
It is still worse for a person to indulge in his animal passions and
escape the consequences of his acts. Nature is relentless and will
have full revenge for any such violation of her laws. Moral results
can only be produced by moral restraints. All other restraints defeat
the very purpose for which they are intended. The reasoning
underlying the use of artificial methods is that indulgence is a
necessity of life. Nothing can be more fallacious. Let those who are
eager to see the births regulated explore the lawful means devised by
the ancients and try to find out how they can be revived. An enormous
amount of spade-work lies in front of them. Early marriages are
fruitful source of adding to the population. The present mode of life
has also a great deal to do with the evil of unchecked procreation.
If these causes are investigated and dealt with, society will be
morally elevated. If they are ignored by impatient zealots and if
artificial methods become the order of the day, nothing but moral
degradation can be the result. A society that has already become
enervated through a variety of causes will become still further
enervated by the adoption of artificial methods. Those men therefore
who are light-heartedly advocating artificial methods cannot do
better than study the subject afresh, stay their injurious activity
and popularize <i>brahmacharya </i>both for the married and the
unmarried. That is the only noble and  straight  method of
birth-control.</p>

A District Congress Secretary writes to say that some spinners have
grown so fond of spinning that they are anxious to purchase their own
yarn and get it woven into cloth for personal use. He asks whether
those who have sent their yarn as Congress subscription may buy their
own yarn for the purpose mentioned. The ideal is undoubtedly for
people during the leisure hours to spin enough for their own
clothing. It is the easiest and the best method of India becoming
self-supporting for her cloth. I would therefore advise all
secretaries to encourage the idea of spinners buying their own yarn
on the understanding that they do not use it for paying the
subscription again.</p>

stoning to death had been defended by some as a penalty described by

assures me that “the Koran enjoins no such punish-ment as stoning”.
I would like to know on what ground it has been defended at Kabul and
the defence upheld in India by a section of Mussalmans. I would like

I have repeatedly expressed my view of caste and intermarriage. With
me marriage is no necessary test of friendship even between husband
and wife, let alone their respective clans. I cannot picture to
myself a time when all mankind will have one religion. As a rule
there will, therefore, be the religious bar. People will marry in
their own religion. Similarly there will persist the territorial
restriction. The caste restriction is an extension of the same
principle. It is a social convenience. An English nobleman’s son
does not, as a rule, marry a grocer’s daughter. She would, as a
rule, be rejected  on  the  sole ground of her birth. I am opposed to
untouchability because it limits the field of service. Marriage is
not an act of service. It is a comfort man or woman seeks for him or
herself. And I see no harm in restricting the circle of comfort or
being selective in regard to such a life-change as marriage. If a
Kenya settler will not tolerate my  presence in Kenya because I will
not give my daughter in marriage to him or receive his for my son I
should be sorry for him but would content myself with exclusion from
Kenya rather than be compelled to contract an incompatible tie. I
would only add that the Kenya settler would not permit me even to
think of any such relation. And if  I put forth any such claim it
would be regarded as an additional reason for excluding me from his
preserve. Though the point is absolutely clear as it seems to me and
though marriage is restricted in practice all over the world to
classes, clans, etc., Mr. Andrews’ correspondent is not likely to
be satisfied with my answer. But I can give him the assurance that I
have not evaded the issue for fear of giving offence. I am not a
politician in the narrow sense given to the word by the
correspondent. I have written as I have believed. I have sacrificed
no principle to gain a political advantage. Probably I would gain
greater reputation in the circles I move in, if I did not accept the
Hindu restraint on intermarriage. And what is my central aim? It is
equal treatment for the whole of humanity and that equal treatment
means equality of service. The duty of service may be denied to none.
The privilege of marriage presupposes temperamental and other
affinity. It would be no crime for a woman to reject the hand of a
red- haired man but she would be guilty of a gross sin if she
neglected the duty of serving him because of his red hair. Marriage
is a matter of choice. Service is an obligation that cannot be
shirked.</p>

easy to follow as it is to give. I claim to be servant of India and
there through of humanity. I cannot always have it my own way. If I
have had my share of fair weather I must face the foul too. I must
not abandon the field of battle so long as I feel that I am wanted.
When my work is done and I have become a disabled or worn-out
soldier, I shall be put away. Till then I must continue to do my work
and endeavour to neutralize in all the ways accessible to me the
poison of the revolutionary activity. A well-meaning and
self-sacrificing physi- cian who prescribes arsenic when he should
have given fresh grape juice is one to be shunned in spite of his
good intentions and even sacrifice. I invite the revolutionaries not
to commit suicide and drag with them unwilling victims. India’s way
is not Europe’s. India is not Calcutta and Bombay. India lives in
her seven hundred thousand villages. If the revolutionaries are as
many let them spread out into these villages and try to bring
sunshine into the dark dungeons of the millions of their countrymen.
That would be worthier of their ambition and love of the land than
the exciting and unquenchable thirst for the blood of English
officials and those who are assisting them. It is nobler to try to
change their spirit than to take their lives.</p>

If the Hindus of Lohani have done what is imputed to them, they are

I draw a sharp distinction between untouchability and <i>varna </i>or
caste. The former has no scientific basis. It cannot be supported by
reason. It denies man the privilege of service to fellow beings and
deprives the “untouchables” in distress of the right of receiving
service from their kind. The caste system has in my opinion a scien-
tific basis. Reason does not revolt against it. If it has
disadvantages, it has also its advantages. It does not prevent a
Brahmin from serving his Sudra brother. Caste creates a social and
moral restraint. The doctrine of caste cannot be extended. I would
restrict it to four divisions. Any multiplication would be an evil. I
would reform the castes and rid them of undoubted abuses but I can
find no reason for their abolition. For me there is no question of
superiority or inferiority. A Brahmin who regards himself as a
superior being born to look down upon the</p>

You have not given your address. If, in your opinion, the <i>Gita
</i>advocates violence in the other chapters, the verses you quote
from the 12th do not take us much further along non-violence. But I
do not agree with you that the <i>Gita </i>advocates and teaches
violence in any part of it. See the concluding discourse at the end
of Chapter II. Although that chapter lends itself to a violent
interpretation, the concluding verses seem to me to preclude any such
interpretation. The fact is that a literal interpretation of the <i>Gita

I thank you sincerely for the beautiful address that you have given
to me and the sentiments that you have expressed therein. I know that
you regret, as I regret, the absence of my friend Maulana Shaukat
Ali, who as a rule accompanied me in all such tours. As it so
happened, it was not possible for him to tear himself away from the
special engagements that have kept him in Delhi, nor was it really
necessary for him to accompany me during this tour. As you are aware,
I have for the time being a special mission in Travancore in which he
is not so interested as we Hindus are.</p>

started in Vykom, I never knew that approachability was a crime.
Travancore is one of the few favoured places in India where education
seems to be almost universal. You are in  a  State  which  is 
considered—and I think rightly considered—to be progressive. This
State, I know, has done a great deal  for  what  are  miscalled  the 
depressed  classes.  I say the depressed classes miscalled, because
the proper term is sup- pressed classes. It was  Swami  Vivekananda<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

 reminded  us  that the upper classes had suppressed a portion of
themselves, and had thereby been depressed themselves.  You  cannot 
lower  the  mem- bers of your own species without lowering
yourselves. It surpasses comprehension that any human being should be
prohibited from making use of roads which are semi-public or
altogether public. Ever since I have entered Travancore, I have been
patiently and courteously listening to the arguments that can
possibly be advanced in favour of such a prohibition but I must
confess to you that I remain totally unconvinced, not because I am
not open to conviction, but because there seems to me to be something
inherently wrong in the very opposition that is taken up by the
orthodox people.</p>

from experience that patience is a virtue. I have in my own humble
manner cultivated that virtue for the past 40 years with the greatest
deliberation, but I must confess to you that I can no longer remain
patient with the curse that blots  Hinduism.  I  ask  you  to regard
impatience with this curse a virtue. Mark my words, I do not say
impatience with the orthodox people, but I ask you to be impatient
with yourselves. Do not rest satisfied till you have rid the land of
this curse and you will tear down the opposition of blind orthodoxy

opinion. Emphasis is not required in the speech, it is required in
the action and emphasis of action means suffering in  one’s own
person. I ask you in the light of this test critically to study the
movement that is going on at Vykom and if you find in the satyagrahis
there the slightest trace of violence, denounce them in unmeasured
terms, but if you find that they are a set of honest people acting in
defiance of the opinion of the orthodoxy of Vykom, but patiently
enduring what becomes their lot, if you find that what I am telling

Satyagraha is a force that has come to stay. No force in the world
can kill it. It is a priceless possession. It blesses those who
practise it and it blesses those in connection with whom it is
practised. No one need fear it, and I wish that you, the educated
people of this place, will study the method of satyagraha with all
its implications and you will admit with me that it is a method which
is matchless, if it is properly understood and practised.</p>

I was delighted to see in the address of the Dewan of Travancore a
reference to the spinning-wheel. You have passed in the Assembly a
resolution recommending the adoption of the spinning-wheel in the
national schools. I congratulate the Assembly upon the resolution,
but as I passed through the towns or the cities of Travancore, I must
confess to you that I have my misgivings about the success of the
introduction of the spinning-wheel in your schools. If I remember
rightly, the Dewan has advertised for an expert spinner. I wonder</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
whether it will be possible to get a single expert spinner in
Travancore and if you have not sufficient expert spinners, I do not
see how it will be possible for you to man your schools with spinning
teachers, but having passed the resolution, I ask you to make of that
resolution a success. Believe me, the spinning-wheel and the
spinning-wheel alone will solve, if anything will solve, the problem
of the deepening poverty of India. You want a universal supplementary
occupation for the agricultural classes of India. Such an occupation
has to be supplemented only by the spinning-wheel, nor is it a new t
hing. Only  a hundred years ago every cottage of India had a
spinning-wheel. Restore the spinning-wheel to its place and you will
solve the problem of poverty.</p>

I have  fallen  in  love  with  the  women  of Travancore. They do
not need the inordinate  lengths  that  the  women  of  the  Tamil 
land require. I am glad that the women of Travancore consi-der
themselves sufficiently elegant if their limbs and bodies are
covered. Their white dress has captivated me. I hope and believe that
it is a symbol and emblem of the purity within, (Cheers.) but I am
distressed to find that they wear the calico of Manchester or even
the calico of Ahmedabad. I ask them to copy their sisters of Assam.
Every woman in Assam knows how to weave, and almost every household
in Assam even at the present moment has a handloom. I ask every one
of you, man and woman, to clothe yourselves in khaddar, hand-spun and
hand-woven. You will thereby place yourselves in direct touch with
the poorest of the land and if you will kindly adopt the advice that
I have humbly ventured to tender to you, you will find that this will
be a land of plenty.</p>

The orthodox friends whom I saw flung in my face, and rightly, the
law of karma. The paraphrase that I would give of the law of karma is
that everyone gets what he deserves, and we deserve what we have
inherited. Hinduism believes in heredity, and so do the scientists,
and Hinduism is a science reduced to practice, but that very science,
that very Hinduism also teaches us to undo the law of karma and that
undoing is done by doing more karma of an opposite character. If, in
my past incarnation, I did something that was wrong, it is possible
for me to undo the result of that evil past by doing something which
is contrary to the evil, and even as it is possible for us to do
better than our past, it is possible for this blindly orthodox people
now to heap bad karma upon bad karma, and earn a reward which they
would not like. The law of karma is no respector of persons, but I
would ask you to leave the orthodoxy to itself. Man is the maker of
his own destiny, and I therefore ask you to become makers of your own
destiny. I am myself trying to become a bridge between my blind
orthodoxy and those who are victims of that orthodoxy,  and, 
therefore, in so far as it is possible for me, I am trying to become

I described myself as a scavenger—<i>Bhangi</i>—and <i>Bhangi

I am not ashamed to call myself a <i>Bhangi</i>, and I ask every

he is true to his salt, is  a  sanitarian.  I described myself also
as a weaver, spinner and farmer. The suppressed classes, the orthodox

It gives me pleasure to find amongst you so many educated men and
women; to find lawyers, doctors  and  other  professional men. But I 
must confess to you  that  I  am  not  satisfied  with  that. It is
good, but it is not good enough. What will tell in the end will be
character and not a knowledge of letters. I would, therefore, ask you
to cultivate the best in yourselves, and you will find that no
strength, however invincible it may appear to be, can stand against
the inherent strength you would have developed in yourselves. There
are instances innumerable throughout the length and breadth of India,
or people belonging to suppressed classes, having not only come into
their own, but of having commanded reverence from the highest among
Brah- mins, and I want you to do nothing less than those
distinguished men have done before you. I ask you to regard
yourselves as trustees for the welfare of Hinduism. I know that there
is at the present moment a wave of impatience going round the
country, not only through Travancore, but throughout the length and
breadth of India, amongst the suppressed classes. I assure you that
it is wrong. You cannot achieve durable reform by becoming impatient.
If we must be impatient, we must be impatient with ourselves, and not
impatient with the wrongdoer. I have presented India with the same
prescription in connection with the conduct of Englishmen towards us,
and I have no other in connection with the conduct of orthodoxy
towards us. And if every vice that is attributed to us is eradicated,
you will find that orthodoxy has absolutely no bottom left to itself.
You will say, and very properly, what can virtue and character have
to do with entrance to a public road, but I want you to look beneath
the surface. There is, in the mind of orthodoxy, religion mixed up
inextricably with the use of certain public roads.</p>

The position that is taken up by orthodoxy is wrong, unsound, immoral
and sinful, but that is my viewpoint, that is your viewpoint, not
that of orthodoxy. There was a time when our ancestors offered human
sacrifice. We know that it was diabolical, that it was irreligion,
but not so thought our ancestors. They knew no better and they had
made of vice a virtue. And we would be doing them grave injustice if
we do judge them by the standard of today. If we are to judge them
rightly, it is necessary for us to step into their shoes and see how
they would have felt, and they did feel when human sacrifice was abo-
lished. This is not in justification for the past deeds, but it is a
circumstance which is in favour of our ancestors, that they knew no
better, and so would I have you to judge the blindly orthodox people
of our own times. They know no better, and I tell you, I am speak-ing
from bitter experience. I am speaking, that is to say, of experience
in my own domestic life. I have not yet been able to remove the wall
of prejudice that surrounds my own dear wife and I be impatient with
her. I must carry her with me by showing to her the greatest
consideration, the greatest courtesy and greater affection still, if
it were possible for me to do so. While I remain absolutely strict 
with reference to my own conduct, while I must become impatient of
any wrong, the slightest that may be lurking in me, I must be
generous towards her. You will not expect me to do otherwise. Then
similarly I expect you not to feel otherwise towards the orthodox
people, and that is the secret of a true religious life. Swamiji told
me yesterday, religion was one. I combated that view, and I combat it
here this morning. So long as there are different human heads, so
long will there be different religions, but the secret of a true
religious life is to tolerate one another’s religion. What may
appear evil to us in certain religious practices is not necessarily
evil to those who follow those practices. I cannot, I dare not, blind
myself to existing differences. I cannot rub them off the slate, if I
would, but knowing those differences, I must love even those who
differ from me. You will find an exemplification of this law
throughout the world. No two leaves of this very tree, under whose
shadow we are sitting, are alike, though they spring from the same
root, but, even as the leaves live together in perfect harmony and
present to us a beautiful whole, so must we, divided humanity present
to the outsider looking upon us a beautiful whole. That can be done

orthodoxy, and hence I present to the world the law of non-violence
and I say that a man who wants to lead a religious life on this earth
and a man who wants to realize himself on this earth  in  this
incarnation must remain non-violent in every shape and form and in
every one of his actions. And I am here to tell you that, had this
Vykom satyagraha been carried on in that absolutely non-violent
spirit and had that campaign received that support from you which it
should have received, the battle would have closed long ago. I have
given my need of praise to the satyagrahis of Vykom. They have done
well. They have commanded my admiration, but that was only one side
of the picture. I would be untrue to you if I did not present to you
the other side of the picture but there again, applying the same law
of non-violence, I refuse to condemn them. They have done their best,
but I ask them and I ask you to do  better.  They  have done no
physical violence to anybody, but their thoughts and their minds were
not non-violent. I discovered that even during my discussion with
them. They feel bitter towards the orthodox people who are putting up
this opposition. They are angry with them and they distrust their
motives. They distrust the motives of the Government. I say that all
these things are beneath the dignity of satyagraha. I will take the
Government at its word. I believe the orthodox when they say that it
does violence to their religious sentiment when I pass through their
road and, by giving them the same credit for honesty which I would
claim for myself, I disarm their suspicion and opposition. I place
myself in a most favourable position by insinuating myself in their
esteem and thereby expect to open the eyes of their understanding. I
want you to take up that  attitude mentally, because I believe that
thoughts are infinitely more powerful than deeds. Deeds are
indifferent caricatures of our thoug-hts, and a student of psychology
has no difficulty in analysing the deeds and tracing them to their
sources, and finding out how noble and mainly a man is and often
times how equally degraded he is.</p>

must also dedicate yourselves to the cause, and never allow the

spinning away in that fierce sun before the barricades, but you must
take your due share in the cause, you must also perform <i>tapas-charya

sacred thing, you must approach this task with a sacred heart. Your
character must therefore be above suspicion and you must be truthful

point, you must cut yourselves off from every worldly tie for the
time being; having taken leave of your elders, you must not turn your
back towards them. They may not expect you to help them even in time
of their need, once you have gone from them. Try to do this in
reality and you will find for yourselves that you have carved a
status which no power on earth can deprive you of; all cannot have
the privilege of doing this special work, but all of you can do
social amelioration work among the community. There is the drink
evil, you must tackle that evil. I do not sufficiently know the other
evil habits that may be prevalent in your community. But you must
remove untouchability from amongst yourselves. You must go out to
those among the suppressed classes who are still lower down in the

Take up the gospel of spinning and khaddar. I have urged His Holiness
to take up this thing in right earnest and ask everyone of you to
take to spinning and weaving and wear the product of your own labour.
I understand that not very long ago everyone of you or at least every
woman in your community was a beautiful spinner. Thousands upon
thousands knew how to weave. Both are noble callings. In spinning
alone lies the economic salvation of India, I am convinced.
Individually spinning, I admit, is not a profitable occupa- tion;
nationally it is one of the most noble and the most profitable of
occupations. Hence I have called spinning the <i>yajna </i>of this
age for India. I was gladdened beyond measure when His Holiness told
me that he would spin himself (Cheers.) and he has given  me  his
assurance that henceforth he is going to ask everyone of his devoted
disciples not to appear in his presence unless he is clad in spotless
khaddar. I expect all the educated men among you to feel  the

not go in for the heavy saris that the Tamil sisters wear in the
Madras Presidency. You do not go in for variety and colour. I am
charmed with the spotless white dress of your women. A few yards of
cloth suffices for the wants of men and women. You must regard it as
a matter of shame and humiliation and degradation that you should
have to fall back upon Manchester or Ahmedabad calico. If you would
attend to these things, that would be your contribution to the
national cause or to the cause of satyagraha at Vykom. Do not be
frightened that it is a long-drawn-out battle. His Holiness told me
yesterday that we might not see the end of this agony during our life
time, in this generation, and that I should have to wait for another
incarnation of mine before I had the pleasure of seeing the end of
this agony. I respectfully differed from him. I hope to see the end
in this very age during my lifetime, but I do not hope to do so
without your assistance. Assist me to the full measure of your
ability to show to you that this wrong becomes a thing of the past.
Do your duty manfull and I undertake to show to you that this fifth

Europe and America—that I am an opponent, a foe, of science.
Nothing can be farther from truth than a charge of this character. It
is perfectly true, however, that I am not an admirer of science
unmixed with something that I am about to say to you. I think that we
cannot live without science, if we keep it in its right place. But I
have learnt so much during my wanderings in the world about the
misuse of science that I have often remarked, or made such remarks,
as would lead people to consider that I was really an opponent of
science. In my humble opinion there are limitations even to
scientific search, and the limitations that I place upon scientific
search are the limitations that humanity imposes upon us. I was only
the other day discussing with a friend on the uses of science, and at
that time I told him a story of my life which I propose to repeat to
you. I told him that there was a time in my life when I very nearly
went in for medicine and I told him also that had I gone in for it,
probably, I would have become a celebrated physician or a celebrated
surgeon or both; because, really I am a lover of both these branches
and I feel that I could have rendered a great deal of service in that
department. But when I understood from a medical friend–and he was
a distinguished doctor—that I would have to practise vivisection I
recoiled with horror from it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Probably, some of you will laugh at my horror, but I do not want you
to laugh at it. I want you to consider carefully what I am really
saying. I feel that we are placed on this earth to adore our Maker,
to know ourselves, in other words, to realize ourselves and therefore
to realize our destiny. Vivisection cannot add,  in  my opinion, an
inch to our moral height. It may—though many medical men tell me
that it is not an absolutely correct statement—it may, I say, bring
in some relief to a man whose body is ailing. But I must honestly
confess to you that I believe in placing limitations upon the
remedies for keeping the body alive. After all it is a broken weed to
rely upon. It may slip out of our hands at any moment. I recovered
from the skilful handling of Col. Maddock<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
  </font></sup>from the operation that was performed by him upon me.
But there was no guarantee whatsoever that after my recovery I may
not fall under a stroke of lighting or under some other accident.
Such being the case, I feel that we have got to explore whether we
should restrain  ourselves  or whether we might let ourselves go.</p>

Therefore, I would simply say—as I have said to so many of the
students of India, and I have the good fortune to enjoy the
confidence of the students world and the good fortune to come in
contact with the thou- sands and thousands of students all over
India, and therefore I would not hesitate to tell them—that they
must make up their minds about one thing at least in life, viz., to
understand what they are in this world for. I place the same view in
all humility before professors and teachers and it is for that reason
that I have so often written and spoken upon and against the
materialistic tendency of modern civilization—I will not say
Western civilization though as it so happens for the time being, the
two have become convertible terms. But there is another aspect also
which I would like to place before you. Many students go in for
science not for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of livelihood
that their scientific studies might give them. It is true not only
for students belonging to colleges of science, but it is equally true
of students belonging to any other college. But seeing that science
is one of the few things in which you have to go in for accuracy of
thought and accuracy of handling, the warning that I wish to utter to
you will perhaps come home to you with greater force than to others.</p>

household words, household names. I believe that they are household
names to the whole of the educated India. They went in for science
for the sake of science and we know what they have achieved. They
never thought of what the profession of science would bring them in
the shape of money or fame. They cultivated it for the sake of it and
Sir J.C. Bose once told me that he had accepted the limitations for
himself long before I had uttered a single word about how we should
apply our minds to science and I speak upon his authority that all
his researches have been devoted in order to enable us to come nearer

not mine but that of my teacher. He asked me to learn by heart all
those  awful  sounding  names  without  knowing  what they were. He
never agreed to place even the different metals before me. I had
simply to learn things by heart. He brought frightful notes carefully
written by him, read those notes to us; we had to copy those notes
and memorize them. I revolted and failed in that one subject,
(Laughter.) so much so that he might not have issued to me the
certificate for goin in for my Matriculation Examination. Fortunately
for me, I was at that time ill; he took pity on me and issued the
certificate. Had it been so, he would really have blamed me for not
having passed in the Chemistry paper instead of blaming himself.</p>

So, the professors and teachers—I except you, Sir, and your race
from the category—the Indian teachers and professors and the Indian
students, all sail in the same boat. Science is essentially one of
those things in which theory alone is of no value whatsoever—unless
you have practical knowledge and unless you conduct practical
experiments. I wonder how far you go in for practical experiments and
how far you take the keenest delight in it. If you go in for science
in the right spirit then I know that there is nothing so great or so
valuable for making us accurate in thought and accurate in action.

Lastly then, I place before you the instrument to which you may apply
your scientific knowledge and that is the humble spinning- wheel.
Seven lakhs villages in India are today pining for want of that
simple instrument. It was in every home and every cottage of India
only a century ago, and at that time, India was not a lazy country
that it is today. Her agriculturists—and agriculturists form 85 per
cent of the population—were not forced to be idle for at least four
months in the year. That is not what I am telling you. This is not my

would not diminish but would grow unless the Indian millions had a
supplementary occupation. Now apply your scientific means to finding
out what such supplementary occupation can be which will serve the
needs of 7,00,000 villages scattered over a surface 1,900 miles long
and 1,500 miles broad, and I assure you, you will come to the same
irresistible conclusion that I have, that nothing but the

not stand the fierce light of local public criticism provided it was

Brahmins, compared to eight lakh non-Brahmins and 17 lakh
untouchables in Malabar, and while he was gratified on their
educational advancement, he felt they should not be refused the
rights of common humanity. Mahatmaji concluded his speech by making
an appeal particularly to ladies who were present in large numbers to

From what little I have been able to see of Travancore and its
conditions, I can heartily endorse the sentiments that you have
expressed in your address in connection with the Royal House of
Travancore. As I have been saying to my friends who were with me, the
severe simplicity of the Royalty in Travancore has bewitched me. I
know the position of so many Princes of India that I must confess I
was totally unprepared for this simplicity of life that rules the
Royalty in Travancore and I thought that I would be guilty of
discourtesy or suppressing the truth if I did not publicly give voice
to what has so enraptured me.</p>

end was not to get more than a decent livelihood or how to shine in
life, but to serve humanity in order to serve the motherland. They
ought not to become lawyers in order to increase cases. The education
they received ought not to be prostituted to the base use of earning
a livelihood, it ought to be used to promote moral growth to enable
them to realize themselves, to understand that there was the Maker

different continents. One of them comes to India. This seeker goes to
those who have understood  <i>Brahman</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

and others, but fails to get knowledge anywhere. He is convinced that
knowledge means the search for God. Finally, he comes upon the home
of an <i>Antyaja</i>. Here he finds devotion at its best. Here for
the first time he experiences simplicity, innocence, and artlessness.
Here he comes face to face with God, and he reaches the conclusion

it, the more it evades him. He is making vain efforts to grasp by

implies that every action brings in its result and in the mysterious

not distinguishable from the branches, who can identify the fruit of
one man’s action amidst the complex of the collective acts of many
persons? What right have we to know this? Even a king’s soldier has
no right to know the result of his own action, why should we who are

worship God by any other name that he likes. There is no reason to
believe that the example of Ajamil<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>is fictitious. But the question is not whether Ajamil
did exist; it is whether someone did save himself by chanting the
name of God. To disregard the experiences of mankind as described by
the authors of the Puranas, is to disregard the history of mankind.
The battle against <i>maya </i>is going on all the time. A person
such as Ajamil chanted the name of Narayana while fighting that
battle. Mirabai repeated  the   name   of   Giridhar<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
     </font></sup>while  sleeping,   sitting,  eating   or drinking.
This is not a substitute for struggle, but rather it sanctifies the
struggle. Anyone who chants <i>Ramanama</i>, who repeats the
<i>Dwadashamantra</i>, is not defeated in his battle with <i>maya</i>,
but defeats the latter. Hence the poet has sung that although <i>maya
</i>entices all, it accepts defeat at the hands of the true devotees
of God.</p>

The  example  of   Rama   confronting   Ravana<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
     </font></sup>is  ever   present before us. If this does not
satisfy one, it only means that one regards Rama and Ravana as
historical characters. As such, they no longer exist. However, Ravana
as <i>maya </i>continues to exist today and Rama’s devotees, those
whose heart is His abode, are every day destroying Ravana.</p>

What a delusion it is to desire to know that which is known only
after death? What would be the plight of a child of five if it
desires to know what is going to happen to him at fifty? However,
just as an intelligent child can guess his future from the experience
of others , we too can satisfy ourselves by guessing the state after
death on the basis of other men’s experience.</p>

The correspondent has taken an image literally, has used a
mislea-ding metaphor and, as a result, has fallen into a trap. The
image is not God. Man, however, projects godliness on it and makes it
an object of rapt contemplation. We cannot create human beings out of
wood nor use wooden dolls to serve our purpose; but hundreds of
thousands of those good sons and daughters, who refresh the memories
of their parents throu-gh photographs do nothing wrong! God is
omnipresent, even a pebble in the Narmada can represent Him and serve
as an object of worship.</p>

villages and in service to villagers through the spinning-wheel and
such other things, he should hasten to go there.</p>

Moreover, although the prices of paper have gone down, the price of

There is some truth in these arguments. The subscriber wishes me to

I regard the subscribers as partners in <i>Navajivan</i>. I insist on
publishing it only as long as a certain minimum number of persons
subscribe to it. I also propose to meet its expenses through
subscriptions alone and not through advertisements. Hence its
subscribers can, if they so desire, put an end to its publication.</p>

It is indeed true that <i>Navajivan </i>is not a newspaper, but a
paper intended to propagate certain views. It tests these views in
two ways: in the first place by bringing them up for discussion from
time to time, and secondly, by finding out the number of people who
support these views.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
<i>Navajivan </i>searches for the means for securing swaraj and puts
them before the public; hence it presents something new. It does not
attempt to do what other newspapers do. What is not found in other
newspapers constantly appears in <i>Navajivan</i>, and in this way
the paper maintains its novelty and distinctiveness. It does not
propose  to compete with other newspapers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
It is obvious that <i>Navajivan </i>is not as interesting as it used
to be. At one time its subscribers numbered about 40,000 as against
only 6,000 today. Swami Anand believes that the reason is that
now-a-days I write more for <i>Young India </i>and less for
<i>Navajivan</i>. I do not think this is correct. <i>Young India </i>is
in the same pitiable plight today as <i>Navajivan</i>. Its
circulation, too, which had reached the figure of 30,000 is now
almost the same as that of <i>Navajivan</i>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Nevertheless, I still cherish the desire to write more in <i>Navajivan</i>.
God willing, it will be fulfilled, and then the Swami’s doubts will
be resolved.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The fact is that what I am putting before the public now is neither
intoxicating nor exciting. Moreover, there is no hope of winning
swaraj soon. <i>Navajivan </i>does not put forward new means for
securing swaraj but it rather attempts to place before the public the
same old means in new ways. It is interesting precisely because it is
uninteresting. As it promotes the cause of swaraj, it is only those
who have faith in the spinning-wheel and such other means that
subscribe to it; this is enough to satisfy me. Its publication will
continue so long as a certain minimum number of subscribers are
pleased with it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
Those who look upon the spinning-wheel as a powerful means for
securing swaraj, those who regard it as the panacea for ridding India
of her poverty, will not tire of <i>Navajivan</i>. I have no doubt
that those who have patience and faith will come to realize the power
of that weapon, if not today then tomorrow, and I hope that readers
of <i>Navajivan </i>will never entertain such doubts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
The fact that Shri Mahadev Desai gives a diary of my tours should not
be a cause for complaint. My tours are not for my pleasure but for
service. Hence readers have a right to know their impact and it</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
is my duty to report it in some form or other . It is indeed a fault
of Mahadev’s diary that it often praises me. That, however, seems
to be inevitable. My secretary who travels along with me and who
works as my slave, can hardly be my critic. What inspires him to
accompany me can be only love or a sort of fascination. He is not
tempted by a salary. I can exercise restraint on his praises, but I
cannot altogether prevent these. If the good opinion of those who are
my close associates does not swell my head with pride, I would rather
look upon it as a burden and make special efforts to be worthy of it.
As long as I do so, this praise is not likely to prove harmful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Nevertheless, I wish to stress this criticism of the correspondent.
There is always a danger lurking behind praise. If a son continuously
praises his father, he is likely to commit the sin of misleading his
father. Hence a son who loves his father does not praise him. On the
other hand, the father who continuously praises his son is likely to
do him harm rather than good. Or, friends who sing the praises of
each other are likely to dig each other’s graves.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Hence, I request Mahadev to comprehend the essence of the
correspondent’s criticism and act upon it. I myself will try and be
more on my guard.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
There is a difficulty even in this, namely, that I cannot read all
that Mahadev writes before it is published in <i>Navajivan </i>and I
cannot do so even afterwards. Hence certain things are published
which could have been omitted had I read them in time. In these
circumstances, if <i>Navajivan </i>performs other useful service,
this particular defect, so far as it is unavoidable, may please be
ignored by those like the present subscriber.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
The supplement on education is also issued as a matter  of service.
When it was decided that the Vidyapith would save a considerable sum
by issuing its magazine on education as a supplement to <i>Navajivan</i>,
it was resolved to do so. It too reflects a truthful picture of
national education, and hence, it is but natural that its readers
feel disheartened. The truth, even if it is uninteresting or painful
, must be told wherever it is relevant. National education is at a
low ebb today, hence a review of it must carry disappointing news.
However, rays of hope are emerging from this dark disappointment. The
reader should not concentrate on the number of children who take
advantage of it, but should rather note the kinds of difficulties
amidst which the ship of education is making headway. That which is</p>

being poured into national education today will generate fearlessness
in children, will make them fit for swaraj, and will lead  to  their
physical , mental and spiritual advancement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
There is no need now to show why the price  of  <i>Navajivan </i>cannot
be reduced. Nevertheless, I would add that those who subscribe to
<i>Navajivan </i>are its owners, and the profits earned by it are not
private but public income. <i>Navajivan </i>cannot be made a monthly
as it does not contain merely articles; it is a weekly record of
progress towards swaraj.</p>

It is not that foreign sugar contains bones and such other

Hence, from the standpoint of non-violence, the use of both kinds of
sugar should, perhaps, be given up. Or, if it has to be taken, the
process of its manufacture should be ascertained. Thus, foreign</p>

sugar has to be renounced solely for giving an impetus to swadeshi.
There is, however, a subtle non-violent consideration for which all
sugar might be given up. Every process involves violence, hence the
less an edible substance is processed, the better. It is best to eat
sugarcane, jaggery is next in order, and sugar is the worst of all. I
do not see any necessity for the common man to enter into such minute
details.</p>

Those who wear khadi should continue to do so after the attainment of
swaraj, both for the sake of swaraj and of non- violence. The very
same means by which we shall secure swaraj will enable us to preserve
and strengthen it. A nation which relies upon others for its
necessities loses its independence or enslaves others. Wearing khadi
is a matter of non-violence, politics and economics. In accordance
with the above-mentioned law, khadi involves less of violence as it
is processed less.</p>

Then again, as between foreign and [Indian] mill-made cloth, although
both are manufactured by the same kind of machines, the use of the
latter involves less of violence, as wearing it connotes a feeling of
love for our neighbours, whereas the use of foreign cloth not only
implies a lack of such feeling but connotes the presence of sheer
self-indulgence, selfishness and indifference to others. It also
implies absence of benevolence, and non-violence.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Anyone who practises the vow of non-violence may or may not drink
tea. There is life even in tea; it is not an essential article of
food and, therefore, the violence involved in drinking it is not
unavoidable. Giving up tea is therefore desirable. Indentured
labourers are employed wherever there are tea gardens. India is well
aware of the miseries of such labourers. From the point of view of
non-violence, an article in producing which the labourers suffer
should also be given up. In actual practice, we do not go into such
minute details, hence we could regard tea as being innocent from the
standpoint of non- violence just as we do in the case of other
things. From the medical point of view, tea is more harmful than
beneficial, especially when it is boiled.</p>

It is clear from the above questions that those who talk of non-
violence know very little about it. Non-violence is a quality of the
mind. One who has not understood it will gain little by renouncing
any number of things. A sick person who gives up many things because
of his illness gets no other benefits besides being cured of his
disease. The victims of famine, who get no food to eat, do not reap
the</p>

fruit of fasting for that reason. One who has no self-control,
although his outward acts may look like the result of such control,
acquires no merit. Non-violence does not consist merely in
restrictions on eating. It is the virtue of the Kshatriya. A coward
cannot practise it. The brave alone can show mercy. An act can be
said to be non-violent in so far as it is compassio-nate. Knowledge
is necessary for compassion. Blind love is not non-vio-lence. The
mother who under the influence of blind love pampers her child in all
sorts of ways practises violence born out of ignorance rather than
non-violence. I wish that people would not attach undue importance to
restrictions on eating and drinking and, while observing these
restri-ctions, understand the meaning of non-violence in its broader
sense, its subtle form and essence. A Western saint who eats beef
because it is cus-tomary there, is a million times more non-violent
than a wicked hypo-crite who following the custom in his country does
not eat beef. The person who has put the questions to me should say
to himself: “Although I give up foreign sugar, foreign cloth and
tea, if I do not have compassion for my neighbour, if I do not regard
other people’s children as my own, if I am not honest in my trade,
if I do not regard my servants as members of my family and do not
love them, the restrictions on my diet are meaningless, they are mere
show, senseless practices   born   out   of   ignorance.”

utterance is, “So long as one has not realized the truth about the
<i>atman </i>all penance is in vain.” To realize the self is to
become non- violent. To be non-violent is to love even one’s
opponent , to do good to him who has harmed us, to reward vice with
virtue, and while doing so, to look upon it not as something strange
but as one’s natural duty.</p>

or a single teacher should rest after teaching only one child. My
contention is that not merely ten but even twenty teachers should not
forsake a solitary student or leave a school but should try to
increase their number. When plenty of students are available, the
teacher should draw an allowance sufficient for his living, but his
true test lies in his ability to accept nothing and starve to death
if the need arises, and let his dependents also starve to death. Such
a teacher sacrifices his relations, his parents, his children, his
all for his work. What do those who practise other professions do
when they incur heavy losses? If a person does not find a job despite
all possible efforts, he lets his dependents starve along with
himself; this should be the case with the teachers in national
schools. This would make our dependents work for their livelihood.
When teachers are idle for want of students, they should, of course,
take up some other activity, but even while doing so, they must try
to revive the school. Moreover, seeking out some other activity means
that, in the absence of children, and during spare time, they should
earn their living through the work of carding and weaving.</p>

It has given me pleasure to be able to come to a place which is the
centre of Christian influence. All the world over, I enjoy the
privilege of having many Christian friends and I expect from
Christians in India a great deal. There is nothing in the programme
that I have ventured to place before the nation in which a Christian
cannot whole-heartedly participate. Indeed I go so far as to say, if
I may do so in all humility, that a Christian is the less a Christian
if he does not whole-heartedly participate in this constructive
programme. Those who are born and bred in this land, and to whom this
land is as much the motherland as it is to me, as it is to the

We may have different religions, we may hold different views about

But there is one thing which binds all Indians to the soil. There is
one thing which binds all Indians, one to another, is an indissoluble
tie and that is the spinning-wheel and  its  product khaddar. I harp
upon khaddar and the spinning-wheel in season and out of season
beacause I know that in khaddar alone, in the spinning- wheel alone,
lies the economic salvation of India. The spinning-wheel is a symbol
and a symbol of the binding tie between the masses and the classes.
The classes derive their sustenance from the labour of the masses and
I beg the classes to make some small return to the masses for what
they receive from them. I, therefore, say to every Indian, also to
every Englishman domiciled in India, or who derives his livelihood

himself from top to toe in khaddar and make a return to the masses.

Readers will recall that among the many conferences held at Belgaum
last December, there was one for the protection of cows. Reluctantly
I yielded to importunity and became its chairman.  I believe that the
protection of cows is an important and necessary task in this age for
those who believe in Hinduism. I think I have been carrying on this
work for many years in my own way. The whole of India is aware that
the protection of cows is one of the vital reasons for the friendship
that I deliberately wish to cultivate with the Muslims. However, I do
not regard saving cows from Muslims as the most important aspect of
cow-protection. The most important aspect is to make Hindus protect
cows. My definition of cow-protection includes sparing cows and
bullocks from the cruelty to which they are  subjected.</p>

However, I have taken little direct interest until today in this
great task of protection. I have practised penance in order  to  be
worthy of taking such a part but have not yet attained such
worthiness.  I was, therefore, hesitant to accept the chair, and yet
I did accept it. One of the resolutions of the conference related to
establishing a permanent committee. I had to take part in that too.
Hence, the committee nominated by the conference met in the last week

accepted by the committee. The fact that this Sabha could progress so
far is primarily due to the famous worker for the cause  of  the 
cows, Chaunde Maharaj, who comes from Wai. I am being drawn to it by
his earnestness and initiative. The members of the committee included

Nevertheless, I hesitate to publish it because the chairmanship still
rests with me. Moreover, the founders would like me to continue.  I
am doubtful about my suitability. I feel that so long as those who
are regarded as leading Hindus do not approve of this great task, it
cannot make any significant progress. I also fear that in view of my
firm views on untouchability, my chairmanship may prove harmful. I
expressed my doubts of Chaunde Maharaj again. He believes that my
views on untouchability have nothing to do with this work and even if
some individuals keep away on that score, it is our duty to carry on

The readers may, perhaps, be unable to realize the nature of my

pen shakes as I write this. There are tears in my eyes. Yesterday, I

put before the reader the thoughts which overwhelm me. My predicament
is very much that of a child who weeps profusely because he does not

impatient to see and to demonstrate the victory of dharma. I am ever
anxious to do all that may be needed for it. It is for this reason

agitated. All prayed for the help of Lord Krishna. The Muslims cried
out in the name of Allah. The Hindus started uttering the name of

suffering on the faces of all. The storm subsided and all were happy.

	With  reference  to  the  conversations<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
	   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>we
	 have  had   as  to   the possibility and desirability of removing
	the barriers at Vykom and the picket which prevent satyagrahi
	volunteers from crossing the boundary-line on the roads leading to
	the temple, the position as I understand is this. It is common cause
	between Government and the reformers that the embargo upon the
	so-called untouchables making use of the roads around the temple
	should be removed. In your opinion the cause I have at heart will
	succeed earlier if I advise the satyagrahis to respect the boundary
	line pending final decision  without the barricades and the picket.
	You tell me that the orthodox opinion gathers strength from the
	presence of the barricades and the picket, because the orthodox
	people wrongly infer that the intention in putting up the barricades
	and keeping the pickets is to help them to maintain their position.
	I have gathered from our conversations that it would be possible for
	you to have the existing orders withdrawn under which you are
	acting, if I undertake to respect the boundary-line in the manner
	suggested by you. Whilst I hesitate to believe that the action
	proposed by you, if taken by the satyagrahis, will soften the hearts
	of the orthodox people and weaken their position, I fully appreciate
	the motive that lies behind your suggestion. I am, therefore,
	prepared to advise, by way of trial, adoption of the suggestion made
	by you. After all, what the satyagrahis want is to create an active
	and overwhelming public opinion in their behalf. Their object is not
	to irritate orthodoxy but to win it over to their side. Their object
	moreover is in no way to embarrass the Government in  the 
	prosecution of the campaign but, so far as it is possible, to enlist
	its sympathy and support on their side. I am therefore prepared to
	act upon your suggestion immediately on learning from you that the
	prohibitory order referred to herein is withdrawn. The effect of
	this would be that a very small number, not larger than at present,
	will continue to march up to the boundary-line by way of pleading
	their cause and stand or spin as they are now doing in front of the
	lines.</p>

They will not cross it on any account whatsoever whilst  their
agreement lasts and I expect that if it ever becomes necessary to
challenge in a court of law the so-called right or custom under which
the so-called untouchables are prohibited from making use of the
roads round the temple the prosecution would be under the ordinary
criminal law of Travancore. But I am hoping, with the assistance of
the Travancore Government, to formulate public opinion so that  it
becomes irresistible and that without recourse to law on either side
the common right of using public or semi-public roads is not denied
to any class of people by reason of their birth. I have already
discussed with you the three proposals made by me, namely, referendum
by taking the vote of the <i>savarna </i>Hindus in select areas;
arbitration; or interpretation and examination of the authority of
texts from Hindu Shastras supposed to be available to the orthodox in
support of their contention as to the use of roads round certain
temples. It must be a very simple matter to adopt one or all of the
suggestions.</p>

I am grateful to you for the beautiful address you have given me,
which was well read out by an <i>Antyaja </i>boy. I am sorry that I
cannot reply to you in Sanskrit. But had I been a Sanskrit pundit,
even then I would not have replied in Sanskrit, because unfortunately
today we Hindus have neglected the study of Sanskrit and therefore
the masses cannot be expected to understand that language. But in
order to be in tune with the Sanskrit atmosphere here, I would have
spoken in Hindi, had it been possible to do so. However, you would
not understand it; this proves our sad plight. I hope that the
organizers of the Ashram will provide facilities to enable every
student to understand. Hindi. It is essential for us to recognize our

Your motto is, “One community, one religion, one God”. I had
discussions with Shri Narayan Guru Swami on this subject and since
you have given the subject the first place in your welcome address, I
am also obliged to mention it in my reply. I feel that the attainment
of what is implied by this motto is also beyond our powers. I can
understand the principle of one God. In spite of our worshipping Him
in a million different ways, our adoration finds its way to Him.
However, I feel that so long as the human race continues, differences
of creeds and religions will indeed exist, since there are many minds
and not one. If we look at Nature, we shall find that it is full of
diversities and it is through them that the one God becomes many. To
expect that at any stage in the history of the human race the world
will have a single religion and a single creed is, I think, as good
as wishing that the laws of Nature should become topsy turvy. As a
result of my limited reading, reflection and meditation, I feel that
human society cannot do without the four-fold divisions of <i>varna
</i>and <i>ashrama</i>. Hence, diverse religions and diverse creeds
seem to be inevitable. Tolerance should be our aim. If all of us hold
uniform views, where then is the scope for this generous virtue of
tolerance? However, this search for uniformity is as futile as
looking for flowers in the sky. Hence, the only possible alternative
for us is to tolerate one antoher’s views. According to my Muslim
friends, I, a born idol-worshipper, a believer in incarnation and
rebirth, must necessarily cultivate tolerance for Muslims who do not
believe in idol-worship, who do not believe in incarnation and
perhaps in rebirth. I, a believer in incarnations, do not think that
Christ alone was God, or that he alone was the son of God.
Nevertheless, I should tolerate the fact that my Christian friends
look upon Christ as God and, similarly, Muslims and Christians should
tolerate the fact that I bow in reverence to Kanyakumari  and
Jagannath. I can see that the age of tolerance is dawning in my own
lifetime, because tolerance is at the root of the dharma of ashimsa.
That very same tolerance is at the root of the dharma of truth.
Truth, like God, has a thousand diverse aspects. I cannot therefore
insist that my view about the nature of truth is the correct one, and
those of others wrong. That is why I feel we are fast approaching the
age of mutual tolerance and mutual love. If, therefore, I cannot
persuade Shri Narayan Guru Swami to accept the ideal of tolerance, I
shall content by understanding the ideal in my own way.</p>

Leaving aside this abstract discussion, let us come to more concrete
things. While we cannot have before us the ideal of one caste, one
religion and one creed, we can certainly have before us the ideal of
performing one task daily and regularly for the good of the country.
When shall We learn to wear khadi and thereby establish a bond of
union with the poorest of the poor? We can learn this one <i>mantra
</i>of making common cause with the poor. Instead of talking of
universal love, it would be enough if we give up the calico made in
the mills of Ahmedabad, Japan or England and win instead the simple
love of the poor by wearing cloth spun and woven by  our  own
brothers and sisters. Shri Narayan Guru Swami has assured me that he
will himself take up spinning and forbid his followers from
approaching him unless they are clad in khadi.</p>

We have to practise the dharma of ahimsa and love in another matter
as well. We must free our country from the sin of keeping our own
brothers away as untouchables. A caste Hindu approached me and told
me that the <i>Ezhavas </i>too treat those who belong to lower castes
as untouchables. This must stop. More- over, he also told me that if 
the  <i>Ezhavas  </i>and  <i>Pulayas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>gave  up  liquor,  the  problem  of untouchability
would be automatically solved. I do not regard this as a proper
defence. However, the only way open to us is to profit from this
advice and do whatever needs to be done. We cannot answer back that
caste Hindus too drink secretly. It is sufficient for us to be aware
of our own faults and get rid of them. I hope that, in this Sanskrit
atmosphere, you will bear in mind whatever I have briefly told you
and speedily advance towards the religious ideal which Shri Narayan
Guru Swami is placing before you.</p>

overwhelming kindness. It is equally difficult to tear myself away
from the beautiful scenery that I have witnessed around me.  But
among all these pleasant recollections the one bitter recollection
that I shall carry with me is that this fair land should be blotted
with the curse of untouchability and unapproachability. But I was
reminded only just now that there is also in this land the curse of
invisibility, that the very sight of man offends. If this is Hinduism
I would renounce it today, but as a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu that I call
myself, and one brought up in an orthodox family, I know that it is
no part of Hinduism to have untouchability, unapproachability or
invisibility as they are practised today. But I shall be leaving this
land in the hope that all those crowds that have attended such
gatherings and all those crowds who have associated themselves in the
sentiments expressed in the addresses which have censured this caste
custom will see to it that this blot is removed from Travancore and
Cochin.</p>

I have seen thousands of sisters in Travancore and Cochin. To see
them in their beautiful white dress has been a perfectly pleasant and
ennobling sight for me. But it has equally depressed me to find that
they have taken to calico instead of khaddar. If you intend to do so
it is possible for you to clothe yourselve, both men and women, in
khaddar without the slightst difficulty and without any loss of time.
Not very long ago, every home in Malabar had a spinning-wheel. I ask
you to reinstate the spinning-wheel in every home. You have even now
thousands of <i>Ezhava </i>weavers weaving beautiful cloth. Spin, and
they will weave the yarn spun by you. If you will only do this you
will find out for yourselves that you have saved lakhs upon  lakhs 
of rupees for your land. Both Travancore and Cochin together have a
population of nearly 70 lakhs. If I were to count the cost of
spinning and weaving, it will come to rupees three on an average per
head. That means nearly two crores and ten lakhs. Just think what it
means for this land and it costs no effort to you to clothe yourself
in khaddar.</p>

of coercion of the orthodox. It was for that reason that the fast
against the orthodox was abandoned. It was to avoid coercion of the
Government by embarrassment that the barricades have been
scrupulously respected. It was for that reason that no attempt was
made to dodge the police. It has been recognized that what appears to
the reformers as a gross and sinful superstition is to the orthodox a
part of their faith. The satyagrahi’s appeal has therefore been to
the reason of the orthodox. But experience has shown that mere appeal
to the reason produces no effect upon  those who have  settled
convictions. The eyes of their understanding are opened not by
argument but by the suffering of the satyagrahi. The satyagrahi
strives to reach the reason through the heart. The method of reaching
the heart is to awaken public opinion. Public opinion for which one
cares is a mightier force than that of gunpowder. The Vykom
satyagraha has vindicated itself in that it has drawn the attention
of the whole of India to  the cause and it  has  been  instrumental 
in   the  Travancore</p>

In the midst of the incessant rush I am going through in this land of
palms (Travancore) where I am writing these notes, I cannot resist
noting down a never-fading sight I had to witness at Cochin. Cochin
has imported from Japan numerous rickshaws which its well- to-do
citizens use for their convenience. These are drawn not by animals
but by men. I carefully noted as many of these carriers as passed.
Not one impressed me with his physique. They had neither the calves
nor the chest nor the arms well-formed for the arduous task of
carrying a burden in the hot sun and melting heat. The rickshaws are
built for carrying one passenger only. In my opinion, it is bad
enough for a healthy and full-limbed man to be carried by man, but I
was ashamed of my species and pained beyond measure to see two and
even three passengers huddled together in some rickshaws. It was no
doubt wrong for the carrier not to refuse to carry more than one
burden. But what is one to say of the pair or the trio who in order
to save a few coppers would not be ashamed to be carried by a member
of their species who is hardly fit to carry even one of them. I hope
there is a law in Cochin prohibiting the carrying of more than one
passenger in these rickshaws. And if there is one, I hope the kindly
citizens will see to it that it is strictly obeyed. But if there is
no such law, I hope that one would be passed making the carriage of
more than one passenger an impossibility. If I had the  power  I 
would abolish the rickshaw. But that I know must remain a pious hope.
But is it too much to hope that men who ply these rickshaws will be 
subjected to a strict medical examination as to their fitness for the
heavy work?</p>

A correspondent asks: “Should children belonging to different
castes and living in one boarding-house be made to dine together in a
common dining-room?” The question is not well put. But the answer
to the question as it is put would be that children cannot be <i>made
</i>to inter-dine. If, however, it be urged that no boarding-house
keeper can make rules requiring all who care to join it to
inter-dine, it would be as unreasonable a demand as it would be to
compel children who are</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
admitted without such stipulation as to inter-dining to  dine  in
company with children belonging to other castes. In the absence of
any rule to the contrary, I should imagine that the presumption would
be that the usual rules for separate dining arrangements would apply.
This question of inter-dining is a vexed one and in my opinion no
hard and fast rules can be laid down. Personally, I am not sure that
inter-dining is a necessary reform. At the same time I recognize the
tendency towards breaking down the restriction altogether. I can find
reasons for and against the restriction. I would not force the pace.
I do not regard it as a sin for a person not to dine with another nor
do I regard it as sinful if one advocates and practises inter-dining.
I should, however, resist the attempt to break down the restriction
in disregard of the feelings of others. On the contrary I  would 
respect  their scruples in the matter.</p>

rily contempt for a portion of one’s species. It is a canker that
is eating into the vitals of society. It is a denial of the rights of
man. It does not stand on a par with inter-dining. And I would
strongly urge social reformers not to mix the two. If they do, they
would injure the sacred cause of “the untouchables and the
unapproa-chables”. The Brahmin correspondent’s difficulty is
real. It shows the length to which the evil has been carried. The
name Brahmin should be, as it once was, a synonym for utter humility,
self-effacement, sacrifice, purity, courage, forgiveness and true
knowledge. But today this sacred land is cursed with divisions
between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. In many instances the Brahmin has
lost the superiority which he never claimed but which was his by
right of service. He is now desperately striving to assert what he
cannot claim and has, therefore, roused the jealousy of non-Brahmins
in some parts of India. Fortunately for Hinduism and fortunately for
the country there are Brahmins like the correspondent who are
fighting with all their strength the tendency towards the ominous
assertion and are serving the non-Brahmins with a selfless
pertinacity which is worthy of their high traditions. Everywhere one
finds Brahmins in the forefront fighting the evil of untouchability
and supporting their brief with authorities from scriptures. I urge
the Southern Brahmin of the type mentioned by the Andhra
correspondent to recognize the signs of the times and rid himself of
false notions of superiority or of superstition that smells sin in
the visible approach of a non-Brahmin or regards his dinner as
polluted if he hears the voice of a non-Brahmin. The Brahmins taught
the world to see <i>Brahman </i>in everything. Surely then there can
be no defilement from outside. It comes from within. Let the Brahmin
re- deliver the message that the untouchables and the unapproachables
are the evil thoughts that one harbours. He taught the world to
believe that “man is truly his own deliverer as he is also his own
defiler or captor”.</p>

The non-Brahmin must not be ruffled by the things mentioned by the
Andhra correspondent. Brahmins like the  Andhra correspondent will
fight, as they are fighting, his battle. He must not, as I fear is
the growing tendency, despise the whole race of Brahmins because of
the sins of a few. Let him be dignified enough not to claim right
conduct towards himself from those who will misconduct themselves. I
need not feel insulted because the passerby does not acknowledge me
or because he feels polluted by my touch  or presence or voice. It is
enough that I refuse at his bidding to move</p>

from my path or to desist from speaking for fear of his hearing my
voice. I may pity his ignorant assumption of superiority or his
superstition but I may not get irritated and develop the contempt I
would fain resent when directed towards myself. The non-Brahmin will
lose his case by loss of self-restraint. Above all let him not, by
overstepping the mark, embarrass his Brahmin champions. The Brahmin
is the finest flower of Hinduism and humanity. I will do nothing to
wither it. I know that it is well able to take care of itself. It has
weathered many a storm before now. Only let it not be said of
non-Brahmins that they attempted to rob the flower of its fragrance
and lustre. I would not have the non-Brahmins to rise on the ruin of
the Brahmins. I would rather that they rose to the height that the
Brahmins have occupied before now. Brahmins are born, not so
Brahminism. It is a quality open to be cultivated by the lowliest or
the lowest among us.</p>

headed “An Extraordinary Man. Is He a Mad  Man  or  a Saint?” I
have often said that I do not claim to be an extraordinary man unless
one who is mad after the search for truth be called extraordinary. I

The writer of the article is honest but ignorant and yet writes with
an assurance which is amazing. The pity of it is that the writing of
that character is not an uncommon thing in modern literature. If
palpable untruth can be put before the public about contemporary men

Let us see how truth has suffered at the hands of the writer of the
article. “In his anger against European civilization, he has gone
to the extreme point of condemning all science and all culture,”
says the writer. Though I have undoubtedly spoken and written
strongly against Europ-ean civilization, I cannot recall ever having
condemned “all science and all culture”. My life is a standing
testimony against</p>

the libel. Every sentence that follows thereafter is the reverse of
truth. Where the writer has derived his idea of desire to abolish
schoolmasters and engineers I do not know. Anybody who knows anything
of me knows that I loathe pas-siveness of the body. I recognize the
everlasting activity of nature going on about me and I respond to it
by keeping my own body and those of my co-workers in incessant
activity, always, I hope, of a beneficial character. The writer tells
us that “without the protection of Britain she (India) would become
the slave of Japan”. If a schoolboy was called upon to point out
the inacccuracy of the statement, will he not say that with- out the
slavery of Britain, India would be a free nation living in peace and
alliance with Japan and her other Asiatic neighbours? The writer
considers the civilization of India fatal to spiritual life. No
European scholar to my knowledge has made such a statement. Whatever
else India may not be, she is at least one thing. She is the greatest
storehouse of spiritual knowledge. She is the best representative of
spiritual life. She does not let the mind “drowse” for one single
moment.</p>

only guidance, the letter will smother one and stop all growth. So
far as the <i>Gita </i>is concerned, I do not regard it as a
historical discourse. It takes a physical illustration to drive home
a spiritual truth. It is the description not of a war between cousins
but between the two natures in us—the good and the evil. I would
suggest to “A Brahmin” an examination of the doctrine of ahimsa
apart from the incidents he quotes. <i>Ahimsa paramo </i><i>dharmah
</i>is one of the highest truths of life. Any fall from it must be
regarded as a fall. Euclid’s straight line may not be capable of
being drawn on a blackboard. But the impossibility of the task cannot
be permitted to alter the definition. Judged by that test even the
uprooting of a plant is an evil. And who does not feel a pang on
plucking a beautiful rose? That we do not feel a pang on plucking a
weed does not affect the doctrine. It shows that we do not know the
place of weeds in nature. Therefore all injury is a violation of the
doctrine of ahimsa. The fullest application of ahimsa  does make life
impossible. Then, let the truth remain though we may all perish. The
teachers of old have carried the doctrine to its logical extent and
laid down that the physical life is  an  evil,  an embarrassment.
<i>Moksha </i>is a bodyless superphysical state in which there is
neither drinking nor eating and therefore neither the milking of
buffalo nor the plucking even of a weed. It may be difficult for us
to grasp or appreciate the truth, it may be and is impossible fully
to live up to it. Nevertheless, I have no doubt that it is the truth.
And virtue lies in regulating our lives in accordance with it and to
the best of our ability. A true perception is half the battle.  Life 
becomes livable and lovable only to the extent that we apply the
grand doctrine in actual practice. For then we hold the flesh in
bondage rather than live in perpetual bondage to the flesh.</p>

juncture of our statements on the tragedy can do any tangible good
except in so far as the fulfilment of a promise must do in any case.
The publication will, however, do one indirect good.There are
material differences between us on the inferences we have drawn from
the same facts. There are differences too in the degree of reliance
we have placed upon the evidence given to us by witnesses. When  we
discovered the differences between us we both felt grieved and tried
to come nearer each other. We even referred our differences to Hakim
Saheb and Dr. Ansari for our guidance. Fortunatley, Pandit Motilalji
was present at our discussion. We could find nothing in the
discussion to induce us to make any radical alteration in our view-
points. These discussions took place at Delhi. We then decided to
travel together a few hours to re-examine ourselves and to see
whether we could remodel our statements. Beyond making some
altera-tions we were not able to come nearer. We also examined the
suggestion made by Hakim Saheb and supported to an extent by Pandit
Motilalji not to publish the statements. But we, or at least I, came
to the conclusion that the public which had hitherto known the Ali
Brothers and me to be always in agreement about so many public things
should know that we too might differ on some matters, but without
suspecting each other of conscious bias or wilful perversion of facts
and  without mutual affection being in any way affected. Our open
acknowled- gment of our differences will be an object-lesson in
mutual toleration. Let the public know that neither the Maulana Saheb
nor I have spared pains to come near each other. But there was no
desire for suppression of opinion. We have made alterations in our
original drafts. But in no case has either party surrendered his
confirmed opinions. We have each softened expressions here and there
so as not to wound susceptibilities. But beyond that the originals
have  not  suffered material alterations.</p>

conflagration was a poem in the notorious pamphlet published by Mr.
Jiwandas, Secretary, Sanatan Dharma Sabha at Rawalpindi, and imported
by him into Kohat. It contained a number of <i>bhajans </i>or poems
in praise of Shri Krishna and Hindu-Muslim unity. But it also
contained the one in question. It was a highly offensive poem,
undoubtedly calculated to wound Muslim susceptibility. Mr. Jiwandas
was not the author. He did not import the pamphlet in order to
irritate the Mussalmans. As soon as the matter was brought to the
notice of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha, it sent a written apology to the
Mussal- mans for the offending poem and removed it from the unsold
copies. This might have satisfied the Mussalmans, but it did not. The
unsold copies, over 500 according to Mussalman testimony and over 900
according to Hindu testimony, were brought to the Town Hall and
publicly burnt in the presence of the Assistant Commissioner and a
large concourse of Mussalmans. The cover of the pamphlet contained a
portrait of Shri Krishna. Mr. Jiwandas was arrested. This took place
on the 3rd September, 1924. He was to be brought before the Court on
the 11th. The Hindus tried to avoid the Court proceedings and to
settle the matter amicably. A Khilafat deputation, too, came from
Peshawar for the purpose. The Mussalmans wanted to  try Mr. Jiwandas
according to <i>Shariat. </i>The Hindus declined but offered to
submit to the award of the Khilafatists. The negotiations fell
through. The Hindus, therefore, applied for discharge of Mr.
Jiwandas. He was released on the 8th September under security and
under instructions to leave Kohat. He did leave Kohat immediately.
This anticipation of the date of trial enraged the Mussalmans. During
the night of the 8th September they held an excited meeting at which
fiery speeches were made. It was resolved to approach the Deputy
Commissioner in a body and to demand the re-arrest of Mr. Jiwandas
and the arrest of certain other members of the Sanatan Dharma Sabha.
Reprisals  against the Hindus were threatened if the Deputy
Commissioner did not listen to the demand. Messages were sent out to
the neighbouring villages to join the assembly in the morning. About
two thousand angry Mussalmans, according to Pir Kamal, marched to the
Town Hall. The request of the Deputy Commissioner that a samll party
from among the assembly should see him in the Town Hall was rejected

the demand and the elated crowd dispersed.</p>

The Hindus had become nervous through fright during the preceding
week. On the 6th of September they sent a letter to the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Deputy Commissioner informing him of the prevailing excitement among
the Mussalmans. But no precautions were taken by him for their
safety. They were aware of the proceedings of  the  meeting during
the night of the 8th. They therefore sent in the morning of the 9th
telegrams notifying the authorities of their fears and requesting
them not to re-arrest Jiwandas. The latter still took no notice.
There is a hot dispute as to what the crowd did after dispersal near
the Town Hall. The Mussalman version is that the Hindus fired the
first shot killing a Mussalman boy and wounding another, that this
infuriated the mob resulting in the burning and looting that took
place that day. The Hindu version is that the first shot was fired by
the Mussalmans, that they, the Hindus, fired afterwards and in
self-defence and that the whole of the looting and burning was
according to a pre-arranged plan and after pre-arranged signals.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
There is no direct evidence on the point and I am unable to reach a
definite conclusion. The Mussalmans contend that no damage would have
occurred if the Hindus had not fired the first shot. I am unable to
accept the contention. In my opinion some damage was bound to be
done, whether the Hindus had fired or not.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It is certain to me that Sardar Makhan Singh’s suburban residence
was burnt and its garden damaged by the crowd before the firing, no
matter from which side it was begun. But there is no doubt that the
Hindus did fire and kill or wound some Mussalmans at some stage or
other. My opinion is that the crowd elated by its success dispersed
itself in several directions and made hostile demonstrations in front
of Hindu houses or shops. I should not be surprised if the Hindus
who, as shown above, were already nervous and  were expecting
trouble, took fright at the demonstration and fired in order to scare
away the mob. But such an attitude of resistance  would infuriate the
Mussalmans who were unused to resistance on the part of Hindus. For
as Pir Kamal said, the Frontier Mussalmans regarded themselves as
<i>Nayaks </i>(protectors) and the Hindus as <i>Hamsayas </i>(here
meaning protected). The more, therefore, the Hindus showed resistance
the greater became the fury of the mob.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
To me, then, who fired the first shot has not much significance for
the purpose of the distribution of blame. No doubt, if the Hindus had
not defended themselves at all or if they had not fired the first
shot, assuming that they did, the Mussalman demonstration would have
exhausted itself sooner. But such was not to be expected of the</p>

Hindus who were in possession of arms and knew more or less
indifferently how to use them. Mussalman witnesses questioned Hindu
deaths or even injury to Hindus on the 9th. I am, however, certain
that several Hindus died or were wounded on the 9th at the hands of
the Mussalmans. It is difficult to give the total number. It is a
pleasure, however, to note here that some Mussalmans befriended the
Hindus and gave them shelter.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
It is generally admitted that on the 10th September the Mussalman
fury knew no bounds. No doubt highly exaggerated reports of Mussalman
deaths at Hindu hands were spread and tribesmen from all parts stole
into Kohat by making breaches in the walls and otherwise. Destruction
of life and property, in which the constabulary freely partook, which
was witnessed by the officials and which they could have prevented,
was general. Had not the Hindus been withdrawn from their places and
taken to the Cantonment, not many would have lived. Much has been
made of the fact that Mussalmans too suffered and that tribesmen,
once their passion for looting is let loose, make no distinction
between Hindu property and Mussalman property. Whilst this statement
is true, I do not believe that the Mussalmans have suffered in any
way proportionate  to  the Hindus. And I must respectfully mention
that even some Khilafat volunteers, whose duty it was to protect
Hindus and regard them as their own kith and kin, neglected their
duty and not only joined in the loot but also took part in the
previous incitement.</p>

But the worst is yet to be related. During these days temples

I fear the truth is bitterer than is put here if I am to credit the
Hindu version. I must say in fairness to the Mussalman friend that he
did not regard these acts as conversions at all. Taking it at its
lowest, the performance is humiliating alike for the Mussalmans and
the Hindus. It would have redounded to the credit of the Mussalmans
concerned, if they had steeled the hearts of the unmanly Hindus and
offered them protection in spite of their remaining Hindus and
retaining the symbols of Hindu-ism. The Hindus would have gone down
to posterity as martyrs and heroes of whom mankind, let alone Hindus,
would have been proud if they had preferred  death  to  denying their

It is therefore necessary, if there is to be real cleansing of hearts
and genuine reconciliation, for the Mussalmans to invite the Hindu
refugees and give them assurances of protection and help in
reinstating their temples and Gurdwaras.</p>

But the most important assurance that should be given is, that in
future no conversions are to take place except in the presence of the
elders of the communities and except in the cases of those who
understand the full meaning of what they are doing; and if such
conversions are attempted they should recieve no recognition. I would
personally like the stopping of all conversions and <i>shuddhis</i>.
One’s faith is a personal matter with oneself. It is open to any
person of mature age to change his or her faith when and as often as
he or she wishes. But if I could do so, I would stop all propaganda
except through one’s conduct. Conversion is a matter of heart and
reason. An appeal to heart and reason can only be made through
conduct. I am unable to conceive genuine conversions on the Frontier
where Hindus live purely for purposes of gain and where they, a
hopeless minority untrained in the use of arms, live in the midst of
an overwhelming majority who are, moreover, by far their superiors in
bodily strength and use of arms. The temptation for a weak man in
such circumstances to embrace Islam for worldly gain is irresistible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Whether such assurances are forthcoming or not, whether a genuine
change of heart is possible or not, I am quite clear on the course
that should be adopted. Whilst this foreign domination is in
existence some contact with it somewhere is inevitable. But all
voluntary contact must be avoided wherever possible. This is the way
to feel independent and to cultivate independence. And when a large
number feels independent we are ready for swaraj. I can only suggest
solutions of questions in terms of swaraj. I would therefore
sacrifice present individual gain for future national gain. Even if
Mussalmans refuse to make approaches and even if the Hindus of Kohat
may have to lose their all, I should still say that they must not
think of returning to Kohat till there is complete reconciliation
between them and the Mussalmans, and until they feel that they are
able to live at peace with</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the latter without the protection of the British bayonet. But I know
that this a counsel of perfection and not likely to be followed by
the Hindus. Nevertheless, I can tender no other advice. For me it is
the only practical advice I can give. And if they cannot appreciate
it, they must follow their own inclination. They are the best judges
of their own capacity. They were in Kohat not as nationalists. They
want to return not as nationalists but for the purpose of regaining
their possessions. They will therefore do what to them seems feasible
and advantageous. Only they must not try to do two things at a
time—to try to follow my advice and at the same time to negotiate
with the Government for terms. I know that they are not
non-co-operators. They have ever relied upon British help. I can but
point out consequences and leave them to choose their course.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; line-height: 0.43cm">My
advice to the Mussalmans is equally simple.</p>

I know that in spite of the discharge of Sardar Makhan Singh’s son
upon the charge of abduction, many Mussalmans continue to believe in
the guilt of the Sardar’s son. But assuming the guilt of the young
Sardar, his crime was no warrant for the fearful vengeance wreaked
upon a whole community.</p>

The importation of the pamphlet containing the highly offensive poem
was undoubtedly bad, especially in a place like Kohat. But the Sabha
made enough reparation by its apology. It  was,  however, held
insufficient by the Mussalmans, and the Sanatan Sabha was compelled
to make further reparation by the burning  of  the copies of the
whole pamphlet including the portrait of Shri Krishna. Everything
done thereafter to the Hindus was far in excess of the requirements.
As I have said before, I am not sure who fired the first shot; but
assuming that the Hindus did it, it was done in panic and in
self-protection and therefore excusable even if not justifiable, and
that the reprisals taken were wholly unwarranted. Therefore it is the
Mussalmans who owe them such reparation as is possible in the
circumstances. They, the Mussalmans, need no Government protection or
aid against the Hindus. The latter can do them no harm even if they
wished. But here again I am on unsafe ground. I do not possess even
the honour of an acquaintance with the present advisers of the
Mussalmans of Kohat. They must therefore be the best judges of what
is good for the Mussalmans and good for India.</p>

If both the parties desire Government intervention my services are
perfectly useless as I do not believe in the desirability of seeking
such intervention and I could take no part in any negotiations with
the Government. Whilst the Hindus are entitled to and must claim fair
treatment from the Mussalmans, both need to protect themselves
against the Government whose policy it is to set the one against the
other. The Frontier is a non-regulation province where the will of an
official is the law. It should be the pride of the Hindus and the
Mussalmans to co-operate with one another to achieve full
representative government. Such cannot be the case unless the two
communities can trust one another and the desire is common to both.</p>

The municipal address calls this the khaddar capital and calls me the
khaddar king. I am certainly flattered by the description given to

certainly desevres to be so called, but I am quite aware of my
limitations. I realize what a poor khaddar king I must be.
(Laughter.) For this khaddar capital shows no more than ten thousand
spinning- wheels and one thousand looms. The sales do not amount to
more than three lakhs and a half or thereabouts. When you realize
what a khaddar king aspires after, you will realize what humility
must cover him when he hears of these figures. I was told that
although this district was capable of producing 50 lakhs worth of
khaddar per year, this district could not be made to use more than
ten per cent of khaddar and when I look about me in this meeting, you
men and women, I realize how true that remark is.</p>

During my visits to the several khaddar stores in this town I was
given this book of samples by the Khaddar Board Bhandar. I do not
know if all of you know what Tirupur is capable of giving you in the
shape of khaddar. You have here different kinds of checks. You have
also a variety of colours. All the khaddar is by no means too thick
for weaving in this climate. There are women here who are capable of
spinning 20 counts and even finer counts. You can see here a variety
of chintz also, and you can see spotless white khaddar calico, and
those who like borders can also see from that distance a variety of
border too. Yard for yard the price of this stuff is no doubt greater
than the price of calico from Manchester, Japan or Bombay and
Ahmedabad and when you compare the durability of this khaddar with
the durability of the stuff that you get from Manchester, I am sure
that you will find this khaddar cheaper than calico. I also present
you with the universal experience of those who are habitually using
khaddar that their tastes are so refined and become so simple that
their clothing requirements are immediately reduced when they begin
to use khaddar, and what is more, do you not owe it to those poor men
and women who are living in this district that even though their
wares may be a little dearer than what may be sent to you from
Manchester or Japan, or even Bombay and Ahmedabad, you should prefer
your wares to those foreign wares? Your love of the country must be

indifferent character if you neglect your neighbours, though all are
your neighbours, [for] your distant neighbours of the Punjab, even
though the Punjab may be in India. If everyone of you will look after
his or her immediate neighbours, you will realize that there will be
no difficulty and there will be no distress in India. All of you are
agreed that this message of khaddar is an inestimable message. I
therefore ask every one of you to immediately adopt khaddar if you
have not done so already; and I ask you also to reinstate the
spinning-wheel in every home here, for unless hundreds and thousands
take to voluntary spinning, it will not be possible for us to reach
that fineness in yarn which we want to realize, and unless we take to
voluntary spinning, it will not be possible for us to cheapen khaddar
as we are able to, and it was because of the immense possibility of
the spinning-wheel that I ventured to suggest to every Congressman
that the franchise should include the spinning test. I had the
pleasure of seeing so many of our sisters at the spinning-wheel
today.</p>

seen these women working at the spinning-wheel, and if you had seen
what happiness the spinning-wheel had brought to their homes, you
will soon be converted to the message of khaddar. I understand that
for want of your patronage the Khaddar Board is unable to engage
thousands of women spinners. I ask the Municipal Councillors, I ask
you, the citizens of this place, to visit these centres and realize
the truth of what I am saying for yourselves.</p>

I am glad that you are not pestered with the problem of
untouchability or unapproachability as some other parts of the South,
but I do hope that such untouchability or unapproachability as may
still be lurking in our midst will be eradicated without the
slightest hesitation. I am convinced this is no part of Hinduism.</p>

The third thing, I have said times without number, is Hindu- Muslim
unity. It is impossible to reach the fullest height that this nation
is capable of unless we realize the value of the unity of all the
races living in our midst. And the fourth is temperance. Throughout
my wanderings in Cochin and Travancore, it was pressed upon me that
the drink evil was destroying many a home. If the population in this
district is given to the drink habit, I hope you will tackle that
problem also. (Loud and continued cheers.)</p>

It gives me very great pleasure to be able to meet you all in this
out-of-the-way place, and on seeing the musical instruments here, I
wished to hear some of your songs in your own natural way. I know
that songs play an important part in the development of national
life. But there is song and song and there is all the difference
between different varieties. There is song that ennobles and there is
song that degrades; and when you get a real, good song full of
devotion and fervour, it ennobles. Such are some of our old songs all
over India. In days of old, we had our own string instruments, but
today the harmonium has displaced those noble instruments. I wish
that  we could revert to the stringed instruments. They produce  a
deeper melody and so far as I am concerned they have a far more
soothing effect on me than a harmonium.</p>

When I look at all of you and all these sisters who have come here, I
find the majority of them have foreign cloth on. Now I would like you
for a few minutes to consider what the wearing of foreign cloth
means. Not more than a hundred years ago, every one of our
ancestors—men and women—had a spinning-wheel in their homes. And
just as toda we have got a kitchen and a cooking stove in every
house, so had we a spinning-wheel in every house at which the women
spun. The village weavers wove the yarn that our sisters spun; and we
clothed ourselves that way. Now if everyone spends for himself, say,
Rs. 8 per year, for his clothing and supposing this village had a
population of 5,000, we would have saved Rs. 40,000 a year. Today we
are sending nearly Rs. 40,000 from our own village to Manchester or
to Japan or to Bombay. In every case it is bad.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
In ancient times, we were doing what was right and what was good for
our country and which kept our country away from hunger. Now we have
changed it; the result is, when there is famine here we do not know
what to do. I would like you, therefore, everyone to take a vow never
henceforth to wear anything but khadi—hand-spun and hand-woven.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; line-height: 0.4cm">I

his family. It was for me a noble sight to see the ladies of his
household spinning away, when I had the pleasure of visiting  his
house yesterday. He has his cloth woven out of the yarn thus spun. He
and his people were clothed in khaddar from top to toe. God has given
him plenty of money and it was not for the sake of money he took up
the spinning-wheel and wears khaddar. But he has done it for the sake
of his country and for the sake of his religion. But we who are poor
should do the thing for our own sake.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now a gentleman has given me some money to buy food and distribute it
among the poor. I do not believe in distribution of food among even
the poorest of men, if they have strong arms wherewith to earn their
living. Nor do I believe in distributing robes when the people can
work for them. In my opinion, our rich men practise wrong
philanthropy when they indiscriminately distribute money among poor
people, by which they merely want to please their fancy. Such charity
is to be reserved only for those who are disabled, who are lame or
blind or otherwise incapable of doing work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
Therefore, in consultation with Sjt. C. Rajagopalachariar, I have
come to the conclusion that this money might be used for distri-
buting cloth to the poor people in this village or in this audience,
at a rate lower than the bazaar rate. Ordinarily, I must confess that
yard for yard, the khaddar we can produce today is dearer than the
cloth sold in the bazaar; and many poor people tell me that they
would gladly wear khaddar if it is sold at the same rate as in the
bazaar. Therefore, I make this offer to you that those of you who are
really poor and cannot pay much money, will register their names and
take a promise that they would henceforth wear khaddar only and they
will be supplied with khaddar at a cheaper price than in the bazaar.
And if there are more poor people here than can be supplied by the
donation now on hand, I will see to it that I get a bigger donation,
provided all of you present here, promise to wear khaddar only. Now,
that is the good thing we have given up, but which we must now
restore. And I must talk to you about the bad thing we are refusing
to give up.</p>

That bad thing is untouchability. It is one of the greatest curses

<i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita </i>is one of our Divine Books. There are
only four <i>varnas </i>or castes, not five. There are undoubtedly
some verses in the <i>smriti</i><i>s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, which refer to untouchability, but not to the
untouchability of today. That untouchability is applicable to certain
occupations and certain states—temporary states. When my mother or
sister or wife has the monthly sickness, I may not touch her while
the sickness lasts. When my mother cleans her other smaller children,
she is an untouchable till she bathes; and so is the scavenger who
cleans my closet an untouchable until he has cleaned himself after
cleaning the closet. Untouchability is a temporary state to be
practised only in connection with such occupations which involve
dirty work. But it is a crime and a sin to regard a person as
untouchable because he is born in a particular community. And after
all, what the Shastras require of you and me is that we should bathe
when we touch  a  particular person. But the untouchability of today
has degraded a fifth of the race. It carries with it the suppression
of our own countrymen. It has set up a system of superiority and
inferiority. The so-called caste Hindus, Brahmins and non-Brahmins,
treat the untouchables, the <i>Panchama</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

with contempt and derision. They sinfully give them bad, dirty food.

degrade them in every way imaginable.</p>

I venture to say that there is absolutely no warrant in our
scriptures for such inhuman treatment of our fellow-beings. It is
contrary to humanity, it is contrary to the religion we profess—the
religion of ahimsa—to say that caste Hindus may not serve an
untouchable who is bitten by a snake or scorpion. On the contrary, my
religion, the Hindu religion, teaches me that if I see my son and an
untouchable side by side bit by a snake and I am given the option of
saving first the untouchable or my son, it is my bounden duty to save
the untouchable in preference to my son. God will never forgive me if
 I forsake that untouchable boy. There is no other way of self-
realization, except the way of complete self-abandonment. I ask you,
therefore, to shed this bad habit, no matter for how many years we
have been practising it.</p>

He has a band of able, intelligent, self-sacrificing, young men to
assist him. Sjt. Gounder has placed at his disposal his  beautiful 
garden. They have left, all of them, their remunerative callings and
have come in order to serve you. Already, within a few months’
time, hundreds of spinning-wheels have been revived. Several hundreds
of women are receiving cotton from week to week. They turn it into
yarn and bring it from week to week and take away money for their
yarn. That yarn is woven and is at your disposal in the shape of
khadi. But he and the few men he has, cannot render you much
assistance unless you co-operate with him. This is a poor district
suffering from famine for the last three or four years and I assure
you that there is no insurance so effective as the spinning-wheel
against famine.</p>

And you can help in a variety of ways. Those of you who are fairly
well-to-do and cannot spare much money can spare half an hour daily
to spinning. You can learn carding and spinning at the Ashram here,
take sufficient cotton from week to week, turn it into yarn and
deliver that yarn free to the Ashram. That will enable Sjt.
Rajagopalachariar to sell khadi at a lower cost than today. Those of
you who cannot afford to give cotton may give cash. The Ashram is
public property. You have a right to see it at any time you like. It
is in your midst. And so long as you find that its activity is a
helpful activity and serves your district, it is your bounden duty to

since that time, I have been deeply interested in their problems and
difficulties. It is a very horrible thing what we are practising
everyday in the name of religion. I agree that it is very difficult
to solve the problem so long as there are men who are willing to
tamper with the chastity of women and so long as there are women
ready to sell away their honour for the sake of money. So long as
there are such people, so long will this go on. But one thing we can
do is to bring discredit on this profession and destroy the air of
respectability which it now has. We must rob it of every vestige of
respectability. That we shall do by mercilessly condemning the

I would advise you to take census of every  family  in  which the
custom of setting apart a girl for prostitution exists. We must
persuade these people to consider such a course as absolutely wrong.
Secondly, we must take up the case of these unfortunate women and
find them suitable employment. I discussed this matter for over two
hours with such classes of women in Barisal, Bengal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

them the same income in their alternative professions as they are
getting from their sinful practice; nor would they require such an
income if they lead  a reformed life. Spinning may not secure a
living for them. They could take to it only as a recreation, as a
sacrificial practice. I place it before them only as purification.
But other occupations can be found for them which they can easily
learn and follow. There is  weaving, tailoring or fancy-work on
khaddar. Some Parsi women have taken to fancy weaving. There is also
lace-work, embroidery and other handicrafts which can easily yield
them an income of three quarter of a rupee to one and a half rupees

	I thank you for all these addresses. I note that you endorse my
	activities in connection with khaddar. The more I think of the
	possibilities of the spinning-wheel and khadi, the more certain I
	feel that it is the only thing which can solve the problem of the
	deep distress which has overtaken our land. And as I saw this
	morning at the Ashram, old women and old men streaming in, and as I
	saw old women being served with cotton, I felt millions of men and
	women like this had and could have no other occupation than the
	spinning- wheel. If it were not for our self-satisfaction with our
	own lot and happiness so called, the contemplation of the paupe-rism
	of India would make life a terrible burden to us. Just picture to
	ourselves an India with a whole one-tenth of her population living
	on merely one meal a day, living on a bread and a pinch of salt, and
	you will have some conception of the poverty prevailing in India. It
	is not a picture drawn from my imagination but it is a statement
	based on facts collected by the inexhaustible energy of the Grand
	Old Man of India, Dadabhai Naoroji. It was he who first introduced
	us to the statistics that were prepared by English administrators
	and from these statistics he showed that India was daily growing
	poorer and poorer.</p>

	Now, the remedy for removing the distress lies in our  own  hands.

that was woven by our own weavers out of yarn spun by millions of our
own sisters. We chose to adopt the calico from Manchester, Japan and
lately from Bombay and Ahmedabad. And in doing so, we did not care a
straw as to what happened to our own neighbours. We did not stop to
think that the use of calico from mills, no matter where they were
situated, deprived the poor labourers who were devoted to agriculture
of the profit they received from working during  their  spare hours.
It was a crime for which we have paid heavily and we are still paying
heavily. But happily it is not yet too late. If only we will cease to
be callous and indifferent to the sufferings of our own countrymen
and countrywomen, we can adopt the remedy today and help to remove
the poverty from our land.</p>

I have been visiting the khaddar centres in the South and I have been
told that if the people of this Presidency were to patronize or
rather do their duty by the people by buying khaddar, thousands of
these men and women would get a few coppers more into  their pockets.
Everywhere they complain they are obliged to turn away the women that
flock to them for cotton because they are unable to sell all the
khaddar they produce. I plead with you, therefore, every one of the
men and every one of the women who are able to hear my voice, that
you would speedily remove all the mill-made cloth you wear and put on
khaddar which will help your poor sisters and brothers. It is the
highest service you can render to your motherland. If you will only
be good enough to be satisfied with the khaddar produced here, you
will be able to serve your country and in order that we can reach the
fineness of yarn which is necessary to produce fine khaddar and in
order that we can issue khaddar to rich and poor at cheap rates
almost comparable to Manchester cloth, I would request you to devote
half- an-hour daily to the spinning-wheel. It is an incredibly simple
and certain solution of the problem which has been engaging the
attention of the best of our countrymen for a generation. You are
unable now to complain of want of means to learn spinning or secure
khaddar. You have now in your midst an Ashram established which is
devoting the whole of the energy of some of the best of the youth of
our country to the propagation of khaddar. You have but to walk there
and you can have your spinning lessons for nothing, you can have good
spinning-wheels and you can have khaddar to your heart’s
satisfaction.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.39cm; line-height: 0.42cm">Equally
important is the question of untouchability if we are to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-top: 0.01cm">serve our
religion. I am not tired of repeating that untouchability is a</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
curse. As we practise it today, it has no warrant in our scriptures.
It is contrary to humanity and reason. It is a denial of God. God
never made man that he may consider another man as an untouchable. I
do not ask you to dine with anybody, I do not ask you to give your
daughters to anybody you do not like, but I do ask you not to treat
anybody as untouchable merely because he is born in a particular
community. God will cease to be God if he brought to being a single
person with the hall-mark of inferiority. Go to the Ashram, look at
the <i>Panchama </i>boys who are brought up there and I defy you to
be able to distinguish between the <i>Panchama </i>boys and other
Brahmin or caste Hindu boys there. A little touch of kindness, a
little touch of humanity and love has made them one flesh with
everyone else in that Ashram. They are as intelligent, as attentive
and as lovable as any single one in the Ashram. They are as clean and
as godfearing as the highest Brahmin in the Ashram. Let us therefore
shed our arrogance and save Hinduism from the destination that is
impending, if we do not take warning betimes.</p>

The problem of drink is another problem which awaits instant
solution. It is destroying many a home and I hope those of you who
are patriotic, who consider yourselves as servants of the country,
will bestir themselves and go into the midst of those given to the
drink evil and try to convert them. Copy the noble example of Mr.
Ratnas- abhapathy Gounder and do what he is doing in order to save
the country from being ruined by the drink curse. It gave me joy and
comfort to find his cousin brother only a few months ago making a
solemn vow to me that he would throw himself heart and soul into
temperance and khaddar work. It gave me the greatest joy to see his
wife spinning away at the wheel. She needed no money. She spins for
the sake of the country. But I ask every man and woman to spin from
today.</p>
