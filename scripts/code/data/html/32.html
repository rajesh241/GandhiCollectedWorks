I am waiting for a train at Khulna. On reaching Khulna from Barisal
by steamer I received a telegram that Deshbandhu Das<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Those who had differences with him, those who bitterly criticized him
did not hesitate to admit that no other man could take his place in
Bengal. He was fearless. He was brave. His love for the young men of
Bengal was boundless. There is not a young man but has told me that
never had his request to Mr. Das for help gone in vain. He earned
lakhs and gave away lakhs to the young men of Bengal. His sacrifice
was matchless. And who am I to talk of his great intellect and his

On more than one occasion at Darjeeling, he told me that the freedom
of India depends on non-violence and truth. The Hindus and Mussalmans
of India should know that his heart knew no difference between the
Hindus and the Mussalmans. I would like to tell all Englishmen in
India that he bore no ill will to them. “If I live I live for
swaraj; if I die I die for swaraj,” that was his vow to his
motherland.</p>

What shall we do to perpetuate his memory? It is easy to shed tears,
but no tears can help us or his nearest and dearest. Only if everyone
of us, Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis and Christians, all who call
themselves Indians, pledge ourselves to do the work in which he
lived, moved and had his being, shall we have done something. We are
all believers in God. We should know that the body is ever perishing.
The soul is imperishable. The body that held Mr. Das has perished,
but his soul will never perish, not only the soul, but even the name
of him who had served and sacrificed so much will remain immortal and
every one, young and old, who follow his example to ever so little an
extent will help to perpetuate his memory. We have none of us his
intellect, but we can imitate the spirit in which he served the
motherland.</p>

Mr. Das tried to learn spinning in Patna, and in Darjeeling I gave
him spinning lessons and he promised me that he would try to learn
spinning and spin so long as his body allowed. He had converted his
Darjeeling House into a spinning club. His good wife pledged herself
to spin at least for half an hour every day, excepting when she was
ill, and his daughter who was there, his sister and sister’s
daughter were all regularly spinning.  Often would he say to me : ‘I
think it is essential to go to the Councils, but spinning is equally
essential and not only is it essential, it is impossible to make
Council work effective without spinning.’</p>

I regard myself as a loyal servant of India and a loyal  brother and
colleague of the late Mr. Das and as such I publicly declare that I
shall, consistently with my principle, try to give hence-forward, if

have up to now done in their Council programme. I pray to God that He
may ever keep me from doing or speaking aught calculated to injure
his work. Our differences regarding the Council-entry remained, but
our hearts were one. Differences in political methods will remain
until the end of time, but they should never separate people or make
of them mutual enemies. The same love of the motherland which
prompted me to do one thing prompted him to do something else and
such honest difference means no detriment to the cause of the
country. Not differences in methods, but insincerity is the curse.</p>

During my stay at Darjeeling, I could see that Mr. Das’s tenderness
towards his political opponents was every day increasing, but I must
not attempt to describe those sacred memories. Mr. Das was one of the
jewels among the servants of the country. His service and his
sacrifice were matchless. May their memory ever remain with us and
may his example inspire us to noble efforts! Our way is long and
dreary and nothing will stand us in good stead as our own reliance on
ourselves. Self-reliance was Mr. Das’s watchword and may it long
inspire us! May his soul rest in peace!</p>

But for the presence of Deshbandhu Das in Darjeeling, I hardly think
I would have gone there though the sight of the snowy range was a
temptation. I had thought that, for me, to deliver the message of the
charkha to the fashionable people of Darjeeling would be simple
folly. My fear was wholly unjustified. I was privileged to address a
meeting of ladies who listened to the message of the wheel with
sympathy. Mrs. Blair, the late W. C. Bonnerjee’s daughter, was to
start a spinning class for the fashionable ladies. I was privileged,
too, to deliver my message to a small meeting of missionaries. Of
this, however, perhaps more later. Nor did I know that I should have
the good fortune to see so</p>

many Nepali, Bhutia and other people. They evinced the greatest
interest in the massage. But my keenest joy was to see Shrimati
Basanti Devi Das learning spinning and taking a vow religiously to
spin every day for at least half an hour except in cases of illness.
Her daughter knew it already. But she had neglected. it. She has now
returned to it and added spinning by the <i>takli </i>which she
picked in ten minutes. Shrimati Urmila Devi and her children have
been spinning regularly for some time now. And Deshbandhu himself
took lessons on the <i>takli. </i>But he finds spinning harder than
giving defeats to the Government or winning cases for clients. “My
husband can hardly turn the key of his box right; I have always to
help him”, pleaded Basanti Devi on behalf of her husband. “You
can, therefore, understand why it is so difficult for him to learn
spinning.” But Deshbandhu has assured me that he is going to insist
on learning spinning. He had lessons in spinning at the wheel in
Patna. They were interrupted by his illness. He told me that he
thoroughly believed in the charkha and wanted to help it in every way
possible. It was a perfect pleasure to me to see the whole house-hold
of the Mayor of Calcutta plying the charkha in fashionable Darjeeling
creating a charkha atmosphere there. Needless to say, they were all
dressed in khaddar. For Deshbandhu khaddar is not ceremonial wear. It
is habitual with him. He tells me it would be difficult for him to
revert to the foreign or mill-made cloth even if he wished to.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

that I am neglecting the trust imposed upon me. At the time of
accepting it, I warned the members of the Committee that I should be
perfectly useless for any work for the Association if I did not
succeed in finding a good secretary. I regret to inform them, and
others interested, that I have as yet failed to find one to my

worker with no other calls upon his time. He must be a lover of the
cow and have faith in the programme sketched by the Association to
achieve its object. He must have a pure character and a healthy body.

What use has been made of this fund is a question that still
continues to worry people. A Punjabi correspondent says that, in the
course of his khaddar tour, he finds people inquiring about the
disposal of the fund. I have repeatedly stated in these columns that
full and certified balance-sheets have been published from time to
time. Let the public also realize that the fund was distributed among
twenty-one provinces and that several lacs were earmarked. Not only
has the A.I.C.C. published an all-India balance-sheet, but the
Provinces too, have done likewise. Though there has been here and
there misapplication of the funds and even defalcation, on the whole
I am satisfied that the money has been spent for the purpose
intended. Any patient student of Congress affairs can, whenever he
wishes, study the printed figures and find out for himself how the
money was used.</p>

The same Punjabi correspondent asks how the purses presented to me at
the different places are utilized. As a rule, the money is left at
the places where it is given with instructions for its use in the
khaddar propaganda. Only, where I find no one whom I want to entrust
with the use of the money given, I keep it with me and use it through
the Ashram for khaddar propaganda. Where the money is earmarked,
naturally, I have nothing to do but to hand the contents for the
earmarked purpose to the persons concerned.</p>

clothe. I have proposed to give not merely one hundred crores of

My gift includes both. But who will bell the cat? A physician can
prescribe an infallible remedy, he cannot compel the patient to adopt

want of work. Labour is money. He who provides dignified labour for
the millions in their cottages, provides food and clothing or, which
is the same thing, money. The charkha provides such labour. Till a
better substituted  is found, it must, therefore, hold the field.</p>

of others. The story was, I could see at once, related for my
edification. I gently explained to the friend that evidently he had
not followed my writings of doings, though he claimed to have done
so. I told him, too, that my patriotism was not narrow, and that, it
included not merely the welfare of India but the whole world. I told
him further, that being a humble man knowing my own limitations, I
was satisfied with the service of my own country, taking care at the
same time that I did nothing with the intention of injuring another
country. In my opinion, it is impossible for one to be
internationalist without being a nationalist. Internationalism is
possible only when nationalism becomes a fact, i.e., when peoples
belonging to different countries have organized themselves and are
able to act as one man. It is not nationalism that is evil, it is the
narrowness, selfishness, exclusiveness which is the bane of modern
nations which is evil. Each wants to profit at the expense of and
rise on the ruin of  the  other.  Indian nationalism has, I hope,
struck a different path. It wants to  organize itself or to find full
self-expression for the benefit and service of humanity at large.
Anyway, there is no uncertainty  about my patriotism or nationalism.
God having cast my lot in the midst of the people of India, I should
be untrue to my Maker if I failed to serve them. If I do not know how
to serve them, I shall never know how to serve humanity. And cannot

about swaraj that we are to meet, we shall quarrels over the Hindu-
Muslim question. If it is about getting all parties on the Congress
platform, then the A.I.C.C. is the proper body first to consider or
devise new plans. For unless the present Congressmen are fairly
united in the desire and the plan of execution,  a  general
conference must prove futile. If it is the spinning franchise alone
that stands in the way, the method is simpler still. The original
party to the franchise pact should first consider the suggestion to
revise it. They are the Swaraj Party—not the individual
Swarajists—and myself. The pact was between the Party and myself,
representing no party but still representing an indefinite number of
men holding my views. I want to do nothing in the Congress without
the consent of the Swaraj Party. If that party, therefore, desires a
revision of the franchise, it can have it even now for the asking, so
far as I am concerned. And when the party has made up its mind, the
A.I.C.C. meeting can be called to give effect to its desires. I
regard myself as nothing in the Congress. I admit that I do not carry
educated India with me in my views on spinning as on several other
things. Educated Indians brought the Congress into being and they
must dominate and shape its policy.  I feel that I represent the
mass-mind however inadequately it may be. But I want to act upon the
Congress only  indirectly  by  carrying conviction to individuals by
argument and facts,—not by taking votes which might be given for
considerations not based on merits. So long as the masses do not
think for themselves and are likely to be swayed by those who, for
the time being, exercise influence on them, it will be wrong to use
their votes. If, therefore, the Swaraj Party, which undoubtedly
represents the bulk of educated India, desires to reject the spinning
franchise, it can do so today without any opposition from me. Only,
then it will be improper to expect me to lead the Congress. I am
unfit just now for any other work but that of the triple constructive
programme. For me success in it is swaraj, and swaraj without it is
an impossibility. I must, therefore, make room for those who take
what has been called a broader view of things.</p>

not give up his trust so long as he believes in it. He must be
relieved of it. He said that if I retired prematurely I would be
putting an undue strain upon political opponents and on the country.
I must cease to be popular before I could retire in spite of
confidence in my message. And even then, it often becomes a point of
extreme delicacy to decide between persistence and withdrawal. The
fact is, retirement at the bidding of another from service
voluntarily taken up is not so simple as it may appear. But Mr.
Deshmukh has courageously paved the way for the public to think out
the question.Those who would have me to leave the field should at

regard as unsound. My mahatmaship is no passport for the currency of

But the charkha is no bad coin for me. I have faith in it to defend
it against the whole world. I want freedom for all. I can think of it
only in non-violent terms. If we are to get our freedom by strictly
non-violent means, we can get it only through the charkha, which
necessarily includes Hindu-Muslim unity, removal of untouchability
and several other things which I need not  mention here. In my
opinion, the Congress will commit a terrible mistake if it abolishes
the franchise. But my belief in democracy is worth nothing if it does
not include the right to commit even terrible mistakes. I, therefore,
know that my belief, though right in my estimation, must be rejected
if the others do not feel it within them. I want a living faith in
the charkha and consequent active co-operation. Mere mechanical
assent without corresponding action can do no good to anybody. And in
coming  to  a conclusion on the subject, my personality must be
dismissed from consideration. No man is indispensable for the
evolution of this great and ancient land of dharma. Let India live,
though a hundred Gandhis have to perish.</p>

so persuaded to become a shareholder. I have written to the known and
notified address, 22 Amratalla Street, Calcutta, of the company and
so has my client. My client fears that perhaps it was a bogus affair
and he has been done out of his money. In the interests of your
(Mahatma’s) good name and the economic welfare of this poor
country, I fondly hope and wish and even pray, my client’s fears
may be unfounded. The post office has returned all our letters back
through the Dead Letter Office. So, some ground at least exists for
my client’s suspecting that the company is no more. Is it a fact
that Mahatmaji’s son was a Director in it, and is it a fact that
such a company came into being and is still existing, and where?</font></font></p>

would have satisfied myself with a private reply, though the letter
is meant for publication. It was necessary to publish it also,
because it is highlylikely that many shareholders feel like the
<i>vakil’s </i>client. They too should have such satisfaction as I
could render to them. I do indeed happen to be the father of Harilal
M. Gandhi. He is my eldest boy, is over 36 years old and is father of
four children, the eldest being 19 years old. His ideals and mine
having been discovered over fifteen years ago to be different, he has
been having separately from me and, since 1915 has not been supported
by or through me. It has been my invariable rule to regard my boys as
my friends and equals as soon as they completed their sixteen years.
The tremendous changes that my outer life has undergone from time to
time were bound to leave their impress on my immediate
surroundings,—especially on my children. Harilal who was witness to
all the changes, being old enough to understand them, was naturally
influenced by the Western veneer that my life at one time did have.
His commercial undertakings were totally independent of me. Could I
have influenced him, he would have been found associated with me in
my several public activities and earning, at the same time, a decent
livelihood. But he chose, as he had every right to do, a different
and independent path. He was and is still ambitious. He wants to
become rich and that too, easily. Possibly he has a grievance 
against me that, when it was open to me to do so, I did not equip him
and my other children for careers that lead to wealth and fame that
wealth brings. He started the Stores in question without any the
least assistance of any kind whatsoever from me. I did not lend my 
name to  them. I  never recommended his enterprise to</p>

anybody either privately or openly. Those who helped him did so on
the merits of the enterprise. No doubt his sonship must have helped
him. As long as the world lasts, and in spite of its protest against
<i>varnashrama, </i>it will give credit to heredity. Being my son, he
must be good and straight, cautious in his pecuniary affairs and as
reliable as his father. So must many have argued. They have my
sympathy, but beyond that nothing more. I must disclaim all
responsibility, moral or otherwise, for the doings of even those who
are nearest and dearest to me except those wherein they act with me
or, I permit them to act in my name or with my certificate. I have
enough to be responsible for myself. I alone know my sorrows and my
troubles in the course of the eternal duel going on within me and
which admits of no truce. I ask the reader to believe me when I say
that it taxes all my energy, and if I feel as a rule stronger for the
combat, it is only because I remain wide awake. I make the reader a
present of the thought that even my swaraj activity has a bearing on
that duel. It is for the  supreme satisfaction of my soul that I
engage in it. “This is selfishness double distilled,” said a
friend once to me. I quickly agreed with him.</p>

I do not know Harilal’s affairs. He meets me occasionally, but I
never pry into his affairs. I do not know that he is a Director in
his Company. I do not know how his affairs stand at present, except
that they are in a bad way. If he is honest, limited or unlimited
though his Stores were, he will not rest till he has paid all the
creditors in full. That is my view of honest trade. But he may hold
different views and seek shelter under the law of insolvency.
Sufficient for me to assure the public that nothing crooked will have
countenance from me. For me, the law of satyagraha, the law of love,
is an eternal principle. I co-operate with all that is good. I desire
to non-co-operate with all that is evil,—whether it is associated
with my wife, son or myself. I have no desire to shield any of the
two. I would like the world to know the whole of the evil in us. And
in so far as I can, with decency, I let the world into all the
domestic secrets so-called. I never make  the  slightest attempt to
hide them, for I know that concealment can only hurt us.</p>

There is much in Harilal’s life that I dislike. He knows that. But
I love him in spite of his faults. The bosom of a father will take
him in as soon as he seeks entrance. For the present, he has shut the
door against himself. He must still wander in  the wilderness. The
protection of a human father has its decided limitations. That of the
Divine Father is ever open to him. Let him</p>

Let the <i>vakil </i>and his client know that my good name is not
worth keeping, if it suffers because of the errors of a grown-up boy
who has no encouragement from me  in  them.  “The economic welfare
of this poor country” will be fairly safe in spite of failures of
private firms, if the President for the time being of the Congress
and the members of the various organizations remain true to their
trust and never mishandle a single pice. I pity the client who, out
of respect for me, became a share-holder in a concern whose
constitution he evidently never cared to study. Let the client’s
example be a warning against people being guided by big names in
their transactions. Men may be good, not necessarily their children.
Men may be good in some respects, not necessarily, therefore, in all.
A man who is anauthority on one matter is not, therefore, an
authority on all matters. <i>Coveat</i><i> </i><i>emptor.</i></p>

Calcutta demonstrated yesterday the hold Deshbandhu had on Bengal,
nay, India. Calcutta is, like Bombay, cosmopolitan. It has people
from all the provinces. And all these people were as hearty
participators in the procession as the Bengalis. The wires that are

all-India popularity.It could not well be otherwise among a people

discriminate, prompt came the reply, “I do not think I have lost by
my indiscriminations.” His board was free to the prince and the
pauper. His heart went out to everyone in distress. Where is the
young man in all Bengal who does not owe a debt of gratitude to
Deshbandhu in some shape or other? His unrivalled legal talents were
also at the disposal of the poor. I understand  that  he  defended
many, if not all, political prisoners without charging them a pie. He
went to the Punjab inquiry and paid his own expenses. He carried a
princely house-hold in those days. I had it from him that he spent
during that stay in the Punjab Rs. 50,000. This large-heartedness
towards all who sought his help made him the undisputed ruler of
thousands of young hearts.</p>

He was as fearless as he was generous. His stormy speeches at
Amritsar took my breath away. He wanted immediate deliverance for his
country. He would not brook the alteration or removal of an
adjective—not because he was unreasonable but because he loved his
country so well, only too well. He gave his life for it. He
controlled enormous forces. He brought power to his party by his
indomitable zeal and perseverance. But this tremendous outpouring of
energy cost him his life. It was a willing sacrifice. It was noble.</p>

Faridpur was his crowning triumph. That utterance of his is a
demonstration of his supreme reasonableness and statesmanship. It was
a deliberate, unequivocal and, for him (as he said to me), final
acceptance of non-violence as the only policy and, therefore,
political creed for India.</p>

In constructing together with Pandit Motilal Nehru and the
disciplined stalwarts from Maharashtra the great and growing Swaraj
Party out of nothing, he showed his determination, originality,
resourcefulness and contempt of consequences after he had once made
up his mind that the thing to be done was right. And today the Swaraj
Party is a compact, well-disciplined organization. My differences
about the Council-entry were and are fundamental, but I never doubted
the usefulness of Council- entry for the purpose of embarrassment and
continuously putting the Government in the wrong. No one can deny the
greatness of the work done by the Party in the Councils. And the
credit for it must predominantly belong to Deshbandhu. I entered into
 the pact with him with my eyes open. I have since done my little
best to help the Party. His death renders it doubly my duty to stand
by the party, now that the leader is gone. I shall do nothing to
impede its progress where I may not be able to help.</p>

appreciate the courtesy of the acting Viceroy in sending a message of
condolence to Shrimati Basanti Devi Das. I note with gratefulness the
warm tributes paid by the Anglo-Indian Press, to the memory of the
deceased. The Faridpur speech seems to have impressed most Englishmen
with its transparent sincerity. I am anxious that this death should
not end with a mere display of courtesy. The Faridpur speech had a
great purpose behind it. It was a generous response to the
Anglo-Indian friends who were anxious for the great patriot to make
his position clear and make the first approach. He made it. The cruel
hand of death has removed the author of the gesture from our midst.
But I would like to assure Englishmen who may be still doubtful about
the sincerity of Deshbandhu’s motive that, throughout my stay in
Darjeeling, the one thing that struck me most forcibly was his utter
sincerity about that utterance. Can this glorious death be utilized
to heal wounds and forget distrust? I make a simple suggestion. Will
the Government, in honour of the memory of Chittaranjan Das, who is
no longer with us to plead the cause, release the political prisoners
who he protested were innocent? I am not now asking for their
discharge on the ground  of innocence. The Government may have the
best proof of their guilt. I simply ask for their discharge as a
tribute to the deceased and without prejudice. If the Government mean
to do anything to  placate Indian opinion, there can be no more
opportune time and no better inauguration of a favourable atmosphere
than the release of these prisoners. I have travelled practically all
over Bengal.</p>

Public feeling, not all necessarily Swarajist, is sore on the point.
May the fire that burnt yesterday the perishable part of Deshbandhu
also burn the perishable distrust, suspicion and fear. The Government
may then call a conference, if they will, to consider the best means
of meeting Indian demand whatever it may be.</p>

But we will have to do our part, if the government are to do their.
We must be able to show that we are no one-man show. In the words of
Mr. Winston Churchill, uttered at the time of the War, we must be
able to say : ‘Business as usual.’ The Swaraj Party must be
immediately reconstructed. Even the Punjab Hindus and Mussalmans
appear to have forgotten their quarrels in the face of this “bolt
from the blue”. Can both parties feel strong  and sensible enough
to close the ranks? Deshbandhu was a believer in and lover of
Hindu-Muslim unity. He held the Hindus and Mussalmans together under
circumstances the most trying. Can the funeral fire purge us of our
disunion? But perhaps the prelude</p>

to it is a meeting of all the parties on a common platform.
Deshbandhu was anxious for it. He could be bitter in speaking of his
opponents. But, during my stay in Darjeeling, I  don’t remember a
harsh word having escaped his lips about a single political opponent.
He wanted me to help all I could to bring all parties together. It is
then for us, educated Indians, to give effect to the vision of
Deshbandhu and realize the one ambition of his life by immediately
rising a few steps in the ladder of swaraj, even if we may not rise
to the top just yet. Then may we all cry from the bottom of our
hearts :‘Deshbandhu is dead, Long live Deshbandhu.’</p>

India has honoured herself by holding demonstrations of grief all
over the country. But people had hardly time to give adequate
expression to the affection they bear towards Deshbandhu. I,
therefore, suggest that a memorial meeting be held all over India in
every town and every village that has come under Congress influence,
where suitable resolutions should be passed. I hope that people
belonging to all parties, including Europeans, will be invited to
take part in the memorial service.</p>

It is due to the public for me to tell them that Shrimati Basanti
Devi Das has had enormous strain put upon her ever since the death of
her great husband. During the two days I have been watching the
continuous strain of mourners comming to her. Her unfailing good
nature will not permit her to say ‘no’ to anybody. The result
today has been an almost utter collapse. The public should know that
she has a very weak constitution and she suffers from a weak heart.
It is her wonderful courage that is keeping her up during the crisis
that has overtaken her in common with the nation. But even under
normal circumstances it would not be possible for even a healthy
person to bear the strain of visitors coming in from morning till
late at night. After much persuasion she has permitted me to regulate
the time for receiving visitors and after consultation with friends
including her medical advisers I have suggested with her consent 5
p.m. to 7 p.m. for receiving visitors. May I respectfully urge all
those who may wish to see the stricken lady to do so during the hours
mentioned. If this request is respected, it will be possible to avert
what threatens to be a complete collapse.</p>

A giant among men has fallen. Bengal is like a widow today. A critic
of the Deshbandhu remarked to me some weeks ago, “I find fault with
him, it is true, but I must candidly confess to you that we have
absolutely no one to replace him.” When I related the anecdote at
the meeting at Khulna where I first heard the stunning news, Acharya
Ray exclaimed, “It is but too true. If I could tell who can take
Rabindranath’s place as a poet, I could tell you who can take
Deshbandhu’s as a leader. There is no man in Bengal even anywhere
near Deshbandhu.” He was a hero of a hundred battles. He was
generous to a fault. Though he earned lacs of rupees from his
practice, he never permitted himself to be</p>

I came to know him personally for the first time in 1919 in
con-nection with the Punjab Congress Inquiry Committee. I approached
our meeting with suspicion and awe. I had heard from a distance of
his roaring practice and his still more roaring eloquence. He had
come with his motor car and with his wife and family and was living
like a prince. My first experience was none too happy. We had met to
consider the question of leading evidence before the Hunter Inquiry.
I found in him all the legal subtleties and a lawyer’s keen desire
to “floor’ witnesses by cross- examination and to expose the many
wickednesses of the Martial Law administration. My own purpose was to
do something different. I reasoned. The second interview put me at
rest and dispelled all my fears. He was all reasonableness and gave a
willing ear to all I said. It was my first intimate contact with so
many public men in India. We knew one another from a distance. I had
taken practically no part in Congress affairs. They merely knew me as
a South African warrior. But all my colleagues at once made me feel
at home with them, none more so than this illustrious servant of
India. I was supposed to be the Chairman of the Committee. “I shall
say my say on points wherein we may differ, but I give you my
assurance that I shall yield to your judgment.” We had come near
enough, before this assurance was volunteered, to embolden me to
discover my previous suspicions to him. So, when he gave the
assurance, I felt proud of a comrade so loyal but at the same time I

Indian politics and hardly  entitled  to  such implicit trust. But
discipline knows no ra-nk. A king who knows its value submits to his
page in matters where he appoints him as the sole judge. I occupied a
place analogous to that of the page. And I record it with grateful
pride that, among all the loyal colleagues I had the privilege of
being associated with, none was more loyal than Chittaranjan Das.</p>

At the Amritsar Congress, I could no longer claim the rights of
discipline. There we were warriors, each holding in trust the welfare
of the nation according to his ability. Here there was to be no
yielding but to pure reason or party exigencies. It was a perfect
treat for me to put up first fight on a Congress platform. All
courteous, all equally unyielding; the great Malviyaji trying to hold
the balance evenly, now pleading with one and now with the other. The
President of the Congress, Pandit Motilalji, thought the game was all
over. I had a rare time between Lokamanya and Deshbandhu. They had a
common formula for the Reforms</p>

resolution. Each party wanted to convince the other. But there was no
conviction. There was a stalemate and a tragedy behind as many
thought. The Ali Brothers whom I knew and loved, but did not know as
I do now, pleaded with me for Deshbandhu’s resolution. “You must
not undo,” said Mahomed Ali with his persuasive humility, “the
great work you have done in the inquiry.” But I   was  unconvinced.
 Jairamdas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

passed me a slip containing his suggestion and pleading for a
compromise. I hardly knew him. Something in his eyes and face
captivated me. I read the suggestion. It was good. I passed it on to
Deshbandhu. “Yes, if my party will accept it,” was his reply.
Mark the loyalty again! He must placate his party,—one secret of
his wonderful hold on his people. It passed muster. Lokamanya with
his eagle eyes was watching what was transpiring. Pandit Malviyaji’s
Gangetic stream was pouring from the rostrum—his one eye looking
towards the dais, where we manikins were deciding a nation’s fate.
Lokamanya said, “I don’t want to see it, if Das has approved, it
is good  enough for me.” Malviyaji overheard it, snatched the paper
from my hands and, amid deafening cheers announced that a compromise
had been arrived at. I have given a  detailed description of the
incident because it epitomizes the reasons of Deshbandhu’s
greatness and unquestioned leadership, firmness in action,
reasonableness in judgment and loyalty to party.</p>

I must pass on. We come to Juhu, Ahmedabad, Delhi and Darjeeling. At
Juhu he and Motilalji came to convert me. They had become twins. We
had different view points. But they could not brook any difference
with me. Could they do so, they would go fifty miles if I wanted them
to go only twenty-five. But they would not surrender an inch even to
the dearest friend where the country’s interest was at stake. We
had a kind of compromise. We are unsatisfied, but not in despair. We

claim spirituality and used to say that he had  no differences with
me in religion. But though he never said it, he probably implied that
I was too unpoetic to see the fundamental identity of our belief. I
own that he was right. He demonstrated during these precious five
days in every act of his that he was deeply religious. That he was
not merely great, but he was good and growing in goodness. But I must
reserve a description of the precious experiences of those five days

The history of the world shows that no business has prospered in the
past without protection or help. Help is of three kinds; it can come
from the State of society or the individual himself. In any new
venture started with the intention of making money, the rich man
invests his money without any hope of immediate return on his
capital. In a trade venture started for the benefit of society as a
whole, the latter bears the material. Where the Government is well
organized and run for the benefit of the people, it will protect the
new industry by subsidizing it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.37cm; margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
The propagation of khadi is not for the benefit of any single
individual and, therefore, it cannot receive protection from one
person; even if it does, beyond a certain point such protection will
be ineffective, for propagation of khadi cannot be achieved with
money only. If we can get the enthusiastic and unstinted support of
the Government in this popular cause, what more could we want? That
would be evidence of change of heart on its part and</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.37cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
we would gladly co-operate with it.</p>

Now about the support of society. Without it, we cannot expect the
use of khadi to become universal in the immediate future. We have
been trying to secure this support in three ways, the aim being to
make khadi cheaper and to improve its quality. In the first place, we
reduce the cost of khadi by obtaining monetary help from the wealthy.
Next, it is being helped through the franchise qualification. One of
the aims behind the inclusion of spinning as a qualification for the
franchise is that people may donate half an hour’s daily labour to
spinning and help reduce the cost of khadi and improve its quality.
The third way of helping the movement is to increase the number of
khadi experts. Efforts to help the cause in all three ways are going
on simultaneously. During my tours I could see that there is enough
love for khadi among the people, or in other words, they are ready to
wear it; but are not prepared to suffer the inconvenience of looking
for it, or to spend more on it than they do on foreign cloth. We have
thus reached a stage when we can say that, if we can reduce the cost
of producing khadi or sell it at cheaper prices, people will use it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 0.37cm; margin-right: 0.33cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
We have not received enough help from the wealthy. Spinning has been
included as a qualification for the franchise, but it has not been
sincerely welcomed by the people so that the yarn produced in
consequence may influence the price. Thus, if society is not prepared
to do even this for Mother India, how can we spread the use of khadi
as widely as we would like? Besides, as long as voluntary workers who
are experts in spinning are not available in large numbers, the
quality of yarn and  of  khadi cannot be improved. All the three aims
can be realized with the help of the middle class, that is, by a
minority of the people. If they are realized, people will take to
khadi very soon. It is,  therefore, the middle class which is to
blame, whether for a serious lapse or for inadequate effort. If this
class—the educated class— understands the importance of khadi it
will not be difficult to spread its use; for then we shall be able to
lower the price of khadi as much as we wish.</p>

If we have a sufficient number of experts in spinning, we can have,
in the same time, double or one and a half times the quantity of yarn
we get now and of correspondingly better quality. In their absence,
we work on spinning-wheels of indifferent quality and accept yarn of
any quality we get. These experts will repair defects in the
spinning-wheels and so help in increasing the out put of yarn and
removing defects in its quality. As a result, weaving will also cost
less. Handspun yarn, being of uneven quality, takes a</p>

longer time to weave and so the weaving charges are higher than for
the mill yarn. Unfortunately, in the whole country we have only a
limited number of spinning experts. With the scanty preparation with
which we started propaganda for spinning, we could have made no
progress in any other activity. The progress we have made despite our
inadequate preparation is evidence of the power of khadi and its
great importance for the country. It is my firm belief that the khadi
work is the most important among the activities going on in the
country. No other countrywide activity aiming at people’s welfare
has involved as much circulation of money as khadi during the past
four years, or has as many workers engaged in it and earning an
honest livelihood through it or working for it honorarily. The number
is daily increasing. If such a beneficial activity which requires
only a modest effort to yield results receives help in all the three
ways we have explained and in the right measure, I am sure that the
country would become khadi-minded in no time. Let the wealthy give
money, yet all men and women—Hindus, Muslims, Parsis and
Christians—give at least half an hour [to spinning] and let
khadi-lovers become experts in its science and give the benefit of
their knowledge. The country will then become khadiminded, the flow
of sixty crore rupees from it to foreign countries will stop and the
money will be distributed among the poor, and, lastly, the country
will acquire confidence in its own strength.</p>

The image which comes to be associated with an evil practice will do
more harm than good to us. The ultimate <i>haveli </i>is one’s own
heart. The <i>haveli </i>walls are what crutches are to the lame.
They are merely a support. When they cease to be a support and
instead become  a burden, we should throw them away. The gates of the
physical <i>haveli </i>can be closed, but the doors of the
heart-temple are open for all the twenty-four hours. The all-knowing

“But the <i>haveli </i>is a public place. Supposing we do not
respect the prohibition against us? Is it necessary to respect an
unreasonable prohibition?” May not some people reason thus? May it
not be a sin to respect this prohibition? We can imagine situations
in which it will be a sin to respect a prohibition. I do not think
that the prohibition against entering <i>havelis </i>is of that
category. But those who think that it is, will certainly visit
<i>havelis </i>and suffer the consequences. There is no one single
rule in such matters. The general rule should be that, if asmall
minority regard the practice of untouchability as sinful, but
hundreds of others look upon it as virtuous, then the minority should
have patience and respect the prohibition against them. They should
try to educate public opinion. They should see the priest and talk
with him respectfully. They should plead with the <i>mahajan </i>of
their community, but, so long as a majority of the <i>mahajan </i>has
not come round, it would be best for them to respect the prohibition.
If public opinion is against the prohibition, one may disregard it

do so.</p>

hereditary seat of honour which they occupy is in danger. I do not
want them to cherish untouchability and become untouchables
themselves. The idea of untouchability as it is practised today has
no place either in the <i>Bhagavata </i>or in the <i>Gita </i>or in
the Vedas or in the Upanishads. Why, it is not even honoured in
practice. <i>Vaishnavas </i>of their own free will touch people who
are regarded as untouchables when their business makes it necessary
for them to do so. The law does not recognize untouchability. When
<i>Vaishnavas </i>go to courts and mills, they touch the untouchables
and eat, and even go to <i>havelis</i>, without first taking a bath.
To keep up this idea of untouchability which has ceased to be
followed in practice just in order to harass and show our contempt
for the men and women who are regarded as untouchables is neither
commonsense nor farsightedness, neither spiritual knowledge nor
decency. I describe myself as a <i>Vaishnava </i>because I believe
that Vaishnavism has a place f or all these virtues. In my opinion,
the <i>Vaishnava </i>way of life had its very origin in compassion,
in spiritual knowledge and in the desire to purify the fallen. I see
this in Bengal. What Vallabhacharya achieved in the western part,
Chaitanya<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>did in the eastern. In Bengal Chaitanya lifted up
thousands of peoples who were regarded as untouchables. He weakened
the hold of the idea over people’s minds and today untouchability
is practised in Bengal in a very mild form. The idea of being defiled
by touch is altogether unknown there. Untouchability as practised in
Bengal only means not accepting water from the “untouchables” and
denying them the services of washermen and barbers. Even this
ignorant notion has lost much of its strength, and there are today
many “untouchables” who are doctors and lawyers. Education is
spreading among them. In few parts of Bengal do we come across
special areas where untouchables live.</p>

manifestation of grief witnessed in Calcutta on the 18th instant and
the public meetings held all over the country to honour the memory of

best way to carry out what appears to us to be the central idea of
Deshbandhu in creating the trust referred to by us would be to help
in the uplift of the womanhood of Bengal. The founding of a hospital
for women irrespective of caste or creed and an institution for the
training of nurses is, we believe, a project eminently calculated to
promote Deshbandhu’s intention.</p>

I trust that the appeal signed by Lord Sinha and others for an
All-Bengal Deshbandhu Memorial Fund will find an enthusiastic and
quick response from the public of Bengal. I hope that ten lakhs would
be made up by contributions from all the Bengalis and all those who
have made Bengal their domicile and are earning their livelihood or
making money in Bengal. Above all, my appeal is to young Bengal
which, perhaps, more than any other class, is indebted to Deshbandhu.
Whilst ten lakhs may come from ten millionaires, it is desirable that
the amount is made up chiefly from the poor who can afford even a few
pice. The lakhs of men who made the mourning procession in Calcutta
on the 18th instant can and should pay their quota.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
It should be remembered that ten lakhs is  the  minimum required, by
no means the maximum. After paying Rs. 2,20,000/- for the debts due
on the property, there will be available only Rs. 7,80,000/- —not a
large sum—for a hospital and a training school for nurses.</p>

Shall we aim at finishing the collection before the first of July? I
know that the time is short, but if all the centres organize at once

to collect the sum. As a somewhat experienced collector of funds, let
me say to the public that they must not pay to any but the collectors
whom they know and trust. There is not a moment to spare, if we are
to finish the collection in eight days. It is possible only :</p>

I have your letter covering reports of all the branches. It seems
Devchandbhai has put too much reliance on others. Where accounts are
not well kept, we shall have cause to regret. I wrote to . . .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

private. From the reports of the branches you have sent, prepare a
summary that would be instructive and interesting to people and send
it for publication. Also mention therein how many in this activity
are meeting their own expenses, how many at reduced pay and how many
at their market- price and also how much all of them together
receive. You will also give the total number of spinning-wheels
plying. What had happened to Jamnadas? My regards to Khushalbhai and

My definition of swaraj is the will for the time being of the people

variation in the temperament of the people domi- nated by various
circumstances. Therefore, the immediate definition of swaraj is
“Dominion Home Rule”.</p>

summer. The handful of selfless educated Indians who are silently
serving and spreading the message of the spinning-wheel are, indeed,
a credit to themselves and the country. Without them I should be
perfectly helpless. But they are no more representatives of educated
India than I am. As a class, educated Indians stand aloof, not

wrote the passage<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Chintamani, Sapru and a whole host of our distinguished educated
countrymen. The rank and file, though they like me personally, have 
a horror for my views and methods. Some of them occasionally but
earnestly plead with me to mend my ways so as to make it possible for
them to work with me. Nor did I write the passage referred to by way
of complaint. I have simply stated the fact with the object of my
showing limitations and showing, too, that they are as necessary for
the national uplift as the tallest among those who represent the
spinning-wheel with all its implications. I own again  that  the
leadership of the Congress should be rightly theirs and that I must
not force the issue by a mere shuffling of votes. On the contrary, I
must patiently wait till I have convinced them of the supreme
necessity of the spinning-wheel and khaddar even for the political
emancipation of India.</p>

During my Bengal tour, I heard the astounding statement that the

command my approval. If anything I have  written  in  t  hese pages

not conscious of any such guilt. I owe all I am to my parents. I felt
towards them as Shravana is said to have done towards his parents.
So, when I heard the statement, it was with greatest difficulty that
I could curb the anger that was rising in me. The young man who took
up the position was hardly serious about it. But nowadays it has
become the fashion with some young men to adopt the superior attitude
and pose as paragons of perfection. In my opinion, the maintenance of
one’s aged and infirm parents is a first charge upon grown-up sons.
They may not marry if they are not in a position to support their
parents. They may not take up public work till this primary condition
is fulfilled. They must starve so that their parents may be fed and
clothed. What, however, young men are not expected to do is to comply
with the demand of thoughtless or ignorant parents. Parents have been
known to demand money for things not required for sustenance, but for
false show or for uncalled-for marriage expenses of daughters. In my
opinion, it is the duty of public workers respectfully to refuse to
meet such demands. As a matter of fact, I cannot remember having met
a single deserving case of starvation of a public worker. I have
found some living in want. I have found a few who should get more
than they are able to give themselves. But, as their work prospers
and their worth is known, they will not suffer from want.
Difficulties and trials make a man. They are a sign of healthy
growth. If every young man found himself in plenty and never knew
what it was to go without anything necessary, he may be  found
wanting when the trial comes. Sacrifice is joy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
It is, therefore, not right to parade one’s sacrifice before the
public. I was told by several workers that they did not mind any
sacrifice. On cross-questioning, I was told that the sacrifice
consisted in living by begging, in other words, on donations. I told
them that there was no sacrifice in living on donations. Many public
workers did so, but they did not on that account claim to have
sacrificed anything. Many young men have sacrificed lucrative
careers. That is certainly to their credit. But even there I should
respectfully suggest that praising can well be overdone. No sacrifice
is worth the name unless it is a joy. Sacrifice and a long  face  go 
ill  together. Sacrifice is “making sacred”. He must be a poor
specimen of humanity who is in need of sympathy for his sacrifice.
Buddha renounced everything because he could not help it. To have
anything was a torture to him. The Lokamanya remained poor because it
was</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
painful for him to possess riches. Andrews regards the possession of
even a few rupees a burden, and continually contrives to lose them if
he gets any. I have often told him that he is in need of a
care-taker. He listens, he laughs and repeats the same performance
without the slightest contrition. <i>Madar-i-Hind </i>is a terrible 
goddess. She  will exact the willing, aye, even unwilling sacrifice
of many a young man and young woman before she deigns to say, ‘Well
done, my children, you are now free.’ We are as yet playing at
sacrifice. The reality has still to come.</p>

During this Bengal tour of mine, I am coming upon many
revelations—many pleasant, some unpleasant. There is a village
called Upashi, not far from Madaripur. A High School is being
conducted in this village. It is affiliated, but takes no aid from
the Government. Spinning for one hour has been compulsory for all the
boys since the revival of spinning. Weaving was introduced as an
optional subject on the arrest in 1921 of Maulana Mahomed Ali.
Weaving has been still recently confined to half-khaddar. It was only
a few months ago that full-khaddar weaving was introduced. Now the
management has undertaken to do away with half-khaddar and confine
their attention only to pure khaddar. It was a perfect pleasure to
watch about a hundred boys spinning all at the same time. Upon
inquiry, I found that the attendance had not suffered by reason of
compulsory spinning. The head master told me that he could not have
continued  it if the parents had disapproved of it or the boys
resented it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The head master put the visitors’ book before me for my remarks. On
turning over the pages, I read a long report from the Inspector of
Schools. Whilst he had no prejudice against spinning, his experience
of the experiment, wherever made, went to show that they were a
failure as at this school. The Inspector thought that the experiment
to be called a success should be self-supporting. I do not know why a
spinning class should be self-supporting any more than a geometry
class. The success of the latter would be measured by the progress
made by the boys in geometry. The success of a spinning class should
be measured by the proficiency of the boys in spinning. And that the
boys of the High School could show any day. But I am quite prepared
to accept the Inspector’s challenge and show that, whilst the
literary classes cannot be made self-supporting except in certain
cases, a spinning class can always be made self-supporting. In</p>

the first instance, a separate spinning master is not a necessity. By
small inducements the existing staff can be induced to acquire

raised  by you is covered by my previous answers. If they do not
convince I must wait and pray. Nothing that I write further is likely
to carry conviction to you. I have observed that there comes a time
in our lives when argument makes no appeal to us; we are ready with a
counter-argument. I find it even with friends who agree with me on
most points. But there are others on which we agree to differ. I must
do likewise with you. But I appreciate and honour your striving. You
must find me out somewhere in my wanderings. I shall gladly discuss
the whole of your philosophy with you. Sometimes a conversation
answers when the cold print fails. One thing, however, I may say
here. Why do you think that we cannot spin and wear khaddar or remove
untouchability or be friends with the Mussalmans till we get swaraj?
How will the withdrawal of Englishmen help Hindus to trust the
Mussalmans or <i>vice </i><i>versa </i>or open the eyes of blind
orthodoxy and better the lot of the oppressed people or induce the
idle to work the spinning-wheel and those whose tastes are degraded
to revise them and revert to khaddar? Surely if we cannot do these
things now under the pressure of adversity, we are not likely to do
them when we are lulled into a sense of false security by nominal
swaraj? What is there to prevent us now from attempting or
accomplishing all or any of these three things if it is not our own
unwillingness, lethargy or worse? I invite you and your friends to
give your undoubted ability and energy to this constructive programme
and you will see swaraj coming nearer every day. Whether you see it
or not, I tell you that it is coming nearer exactly in the same
proportion as  we  are accomplishing the three objects above named.
The Bastille of untouchability is becoming more and more undermined
daily. The pleasing hum of the spinning-wheel is growing more and
more  audible, and, though seemingly Hindus and Mussalmans are
preparing for a pitched battle, they are realizing that it is a
useless enterprise. But the battle may be inevitable. If it comes, it
will be the dawn of peace.</p>

In my talks with public workers in Bengal, I came across  a young man
who among his claims for public recognition, mentioned his and his
fellow-workers’ <i>brahmacharya </i>or celibacy. The manner of
presenting the claim and the self-assurance with which the young man
spoke repelled me and I felt that he was talking about things he
little knew. His fellow-workers repudiated the claim. And the young
man himself, when I cross-questioned him, admitted that the claim
could not be sustained. A man who consciously sins with his mind,
even though he may not sin with his body is not a celibate. One who
cannot remain unmoved at the sight of a woman, however beautiful she
may be, is not a celibate. One who keeps his body under control from
sheer necessity, does well but is not a celibate. We may not degrade
sacred words by a loose use of them. True celibacy has important
results which can be verified. It is a difficult virtue  to practise.
Many attempt it but few succeed. Those who walk about the country in
the garb of sannyasins are often no more celibates than the ordinary
man in the street. Only the latter is often a better man as he makes
no pretension to virtue.  He is satisfied that his Maker knows</p>

When I drew up the rules for the guidance of the Ashram at Sabarmati,
I circulated copies among friends for advice and criticism. One was
sent to the late Sir Gurudas Banerjee. In acknowledging his copy he
advised me to add humility to the vows mentioned in the rules. In his
letter he said that young workers lacked humility. I told the late
Sir Gurudas that whilst I valued his advice and  fully  recognized
the necessity of humility, the mention of it as a vow would derogate
from its dignity. It must be taken for granted that those who
cultivate truth, ahimsa, <i>brahmacharya</i>, must be humble. Truth
without humility would be an arrogant caricature. He who wants to
practise truth knows how hard it is. The world may applaud his
so-called triumphs. Little does the world know his falls. A truthful
man is a chastened being. He has need to be humble. A man who wants
to love the whole world including one who calls himself his  enemy
knows how impossible it is to do so in his own strength. He must be
as mere dust before he can understand the elements of ahimsa. He is
nothing if he does not daily grow in humility as he grows in love. A
man who would have his eye single, who would regard every woman as
his blood sister or mother, has to be less than dust. He stands on
the brink of a precipice. The slightest turn of the head brings him
down. He dare not whisper his virtue to his very own. For he knows
not what the next moment has in store for him. For him “pride goeth
before destruction and haughtiness before a fall.” Well has the
<i>Gita </i>said, “Passions subside in a fasting man, not the
desire for them. The desire goes only when man sees God face to
face.” And no one can see God face to face who has aught of the I
in him. He must become a cypher if he would see God. Who shall dare
say in this storm-tossed universe, ‘I have won’? God triumphs in
us, never we.</p>

The cultivation of these higher virtues is its own reward. He who
cashes anyone of them loses his soul. Virtues are not to trade with.
My truth, my ahimsa, my <i>brahmacharya </i>are matters between
myself and my Maker. They are not articles of trade. Any young man
who dares to trade with them will do so at his peril. The world has
no standard, no means, wherewith to judge these things. They defy
scrutiny and analysis. Let us workers, therefore, cultivate them for
our own purification. Let the world be asked to judge us only by our
work. An institution or an Ashram that claims public support must
have a material object, e.g., a hospital, a school, spinning and
khaddar propaganda. The public have the right to know the worth of
these activities and if they approve of them, they may support them.
The conditions are obvious. There must be honesty and ability about
the managers. An honest man who knows nothing of pedagogy has no
claim to public support as a teacher. These public institutions must
keep proper and audited accounts which should be subject  to
inspection by the public. These are the tests which conductors have
to satisfy. Their private character must not obtrude itself upon
public attention for admiration and patronage.</p>

Whatever be the motives, I cannot but regard the whole of this
development as disgraceful. I appreciate spinning, but it must not be
used as a passport to vice. I like everybody to subscribe to
satyagraha, but I would prevent by all the power at my command an
unrepentant professional murderer from signing the creed. My whole
heart is with these sisters. But I am unable to identify myself with
the methods adopted at Barisal. These sisters have acquired a status
which, for the sake of the moral well-being of society, they must not
have. We will not incorporate an association of known thieves for the
purpose for which these women have formed their association. There is
 less  warrant for this association, for these are more dangerous
than thieves. The latter steal material possessions, the former steal
virtue. Whilst man is primarily responsible for the existence of
these unfortunate members of society, it must not be forgotten that
they have acquired tremendously dangerous powers for mischief. I was
told in Barisal that the corporate activity of these women had made
them unhealthily forward and that they were already producing a
corrupt influence upon the Barisal youths. I wish that the

I wish that my words could reach them. I would urge them to withdraw
their names from the Congress, forget that they had an association,
but quickly and resolutely give up their immoral trade. Then and not
till then, they may take up spinning as discipline, and weaving or
any other remunerative and clean occupation for a living.</p>

I am not aware of the hindrances the Government offered during my
last Bengal tour, but the correspondent is entitled to draw the
inference if, during the present tour, the authorities are
enthusiastic about my receptions now, that “my power as the
greatest political leader of India is on the wane, if it is not
altogether extinct.” But I hope the correspondent will not make the
mistake that the authorities, according to him, seem to be making.
For the power of a civil resister is like that of the fabled bird

We have been asked what is the duty of satyagrahis in view of the
recent judgment of the District Court of Hooghly, appointing a
Receiver for all the properties including the Temple at Tarakeshwar
and purporting to belong to the Mohunt.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
In our opinion, it is impossible for satyagrahis to resist the
possession by the Receiver when he comes to take it, nor is there any
meaning in resisting his possession. The satyagraha was offered
against the Mohunt or rather his methods. He is not in possession and
the Court’s order does not put him in possession. On the contrary,
the judgment makes it clear that the Mohunt could not succeed, though
he tried in gaining whole or partial possession.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The object of satyagraha was to get rid of abuses in connection with
the temple and to secure public entry to the Lakshmi Narain Temple.
There is no question under the Court’s order of any  reversion to
the old abuses or prohibition to temple entry. It is a matter of no
moment to satyagrahis who has possession so long as the Temple
management is pure and it is not the Mohunt who has the management.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
The satyagrahis’ duty will, therefore, be to hand [over], on
demand, the possession to the Receiver. It will be time to reconsider
the position when and if abuses creep in. It does not matter who
become trustees of the Temple so long as there is a public trust</p>

be again a matter for consideration as to what the satyagrahis should
do.</p>

I could not be a true friend, as I regard myself, of Rajas and
Maharajas, if I did not tell you that I was hurt by your  letter 
conveying your decision about your subscription to the Memorial Fund.
It betrays, may I say, a weak faith in your own countrymen and an
incorrect attitude. You have graciously permitted your name to appear
as one of the signatories to the appeal. If it signifies anything, it
ought to mean a fixed determination on your part to make the
collection a success. But the conditions you impose are calculated to
defeat the collection. If you, a Maharaja and signatory, have the
right to make payment conditional upon the collection reaching a
certain total, how much more the humbler signatories? And if they all
impose such conditions, how can the collections proceed at all? In
all the many subscriptions I have had the privilege of collecting, I 
have  known the signatories to be sureties for the success of funds
for which they made themselves sponsors. Will you not revise the
wholly  incorrect position you have taken up, let me hope, quite
unconsciously.</p>

I hope that the public will bear in mind the 1st of July. Those who
are organizing the Deshbandhu Memorial Service in Calcutta have come
to the conclusion that it is necessary to have three meetings—one,
a mass meeting in the Maidan, north of Victoria Memorial, another
exclusively for ladies at Mirzapur Park, and the third at the Town
Hall, where admission would be by tickets. As the functions all over
India on the 1st of July are designed to be of a non- party character
and as many who did not  share  Deshbandhu’s political opinion have
signified their intention of being present at the Memorial Service
and of showing their respect for his memory, it has been thought
advisable, apart from the mass meeting, to hold the meeting at the
Town Hall, which can be attended by people belonging to different
parties and where suitable speeches can be made. The difficulty that
faces the organizers is to choose names for sending tickets of
admission to the Town Hall. There is, I understand, accommodation in
the Town Hall only for 1,200 people. A certain number of seats will
necessarily have to be reserved. For the balance, applications should
be made to Sj. N. C. Sen at 98, Beltola Road, Bhawanipore. They will
be received up to Sunday next. And if the number exceeds the
accommodation available, lots will be drawn for deciding upon the
names of those who should  receive  admission cards. I know the
prejudice that exists against regulating attendance at such public
meetings. But I hope that the public will realize the difficulty of
the organizers who are anxious to have a representative gathering at
the Town Hall. It will not be possible to have many or any speeches
at the mass meeting. And yet, it will be a pity if those</p>

performed in Deshbandhu’s family. He loved  <i>kirtan</i><i>s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

therefore, these are being conducted every night. Those who would
like to bathe may do that as well. The important thing, however, is
that a meeting should be held exactly at five (standard time, i.e.,
Madras time) and resolutions should be passed. It would be a good
thing to hold a meeting in every place in Gujarat where the message
of the Congress can reach. It will be enough to send copies of those
resolutions by post to  <i>Ganga-swarup</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

Devi.  If,  in  addition,  a  telegram  is despatched from the
Provincial Congress Committee giving the names of the towns, she will
know where and in how many places meetings were held. The meetings
should of course pass condolence resolutions extolling Deshbandhu’s
virtues. But they can do more than that. We revere Deshbandhu for his
services to the cause of swaraj. Deshbandhu’s soul will rest in
perfect peace if we secure swaraj today. That, however, is beyond our
capacity, though it is not beyond our capacity to bring it nearer.</p>

of thousands of people take this pledge, is there anything we cannot

acquire self-confidence. Deshbandhu wanted us to have that.  We
should become self-reliant, for Deshbandhu wanted us to be so. He

that, had not some strong persons lifted me up on their shoulders and
placed me in front of the crowd pressing forward, something terrible
might have happened. Two or three strong men held me up by turns on
their shoulders and from that position I struggled to check the
surging crowd and went on entreating them to sit down. They would
comply as long as they could see me, but they took me from spot to
spot where there was fear of disturbance and, as soon as my back was
turned, the crowd would stand up. The people had lost their senses.
Thousands of eyes were fixed on the bier. As the pyre was lit, the
people lost all self-control. Involuntarily, the whole crowd stood up
and pressed towards the pyre. It was feared that, in a moment, people
would be falling on the pyre. What was to be done? I told the people
: “Now it is all over, please go back to your homes.” I then told
the man who was carrying me to take me out of the crowd. I kept on
telling the people, suggesting by signs and shouting at them loudly
that they should follow me. This succeeded very well with the crowd
of thousands and we were saved from a grave danger. The pyre was made
up entirely of sandalwood.</p>

bad pupil in spinning, I would have learnt it sooner. Once I have
learnt it, I would not find it boring to do it every day. But I am
bored when I try to learn it. See how the thread snaps again and

do for swaraj?” “That is true of course. It is not that I refuse
to learn. Only, I point out to you my difficulties. Ask Basanti Devi
how bad I am at such things.” Basanti Devi agreed : “That is
true. If he wants to open his box, I have to come to turn the key”.
I said : “That is your cleverness. In this way you have made him
helpless, so that he will have always to flatter you and be dependent

Deshbandhu was daily becoming gentler. Custom did not forbid him meat
or fish. But when the non-co-operation move- ment started he gave up
meat eating, drinking and smoking, all three. Later these things came
back, but his inclination was always for giving them up. Recently,
again, he had come into contact with a sadhu of the Radhaswami sect
and after that his eagerness to adopt vegetarian food had increased.
When, therefore, I visited him at Darjeeling, he again started the
experiment of vegetarian diet, and while I was there, he did not
allow meat and fish in the house. He told me several times : “If I
can manage, I will never eat meat or fish now. I do not like eating
them, and I realize that they obstruct our spiritual growth. My guru
was very particular about this matter and told me that, in the
interest of the spiritual effort I have undertaken, I must give up
meat-eating.”</p>

From my experience in Bengal, I see that if we had there the means of
making the experiment which is being made in Kathiawar, people would
flock to buy slivers on these conditions. No, I forget. There is no
need at all to supply slivers in Bengal, for there are many people
who spin, card cotton and make slivers themselves. We should only
have to give them cotton at half price and weaving charges would have
to be at half the usual rate. Many of them are ready to produce yarn
if they are supplied cotton pods, since they know ginning and
actually do it. In Kathiawar, the entire stock of slivers has been
sold off. Let us wait for the results.</p>

I had the good  fortune of being in Bombay when the Lokamanya passed
away. Providence favoured me also on the day when Deshbandhu was

Just as the citizens of Bombay had abandoned themselves to grief on
the day of the Lokamanya’s death, so did the people of Calcutta on
this day. At that time, countless men and women had come out to have
<i>darshan</i>, to weep and express their love. Now, as then, there
was no community or race whose members were not present to honour the
departed. When the train arrived at the station, there was not an
inch of space on the platform. People vied with oneanother for the
honour of carrying Deshbandhu’s bier, as they had for the
Lokamanya’s.</p>

On both these occasions, it was the people’s rule. The crowds were
not ruled by the police, but the latter of their own free will were
ruled by the people. The authority of the Government was voluntarily
suspended and the people’s rule was in force. On that day, people
did what they chose. What Deshbandhu wanted to see people doing when
he was alive, they did on the day of his leaving this world for the
next.</p>

Is this an object-lesson of small value? Is there anything which the
bond of love will not make people do? On that day, they “endured

to suffer what they did.</p>

the nation. People will in these days describe only those who do this
duty as men imbued with the spirit of dharma. They are even ready to
forget the weaknesses of those who follow this dharma. There is some
mean-ing in this. People are not foolish in acting thus. God alone is

National service is the only dharma today, for unless we follow that
we can follow no other. The power of the State has penetrated every
aspect of national life. In countries where the power of the State is
the power of the people, the subjects are happy on the whole, and
where the State is hostile to the people, the latter are miserable
and utterly weak. In such countries the people lead a sinful life and
call it good, for those who live in fear are incapable of good- ness.
To free ourselves from this paralysing fear, i.e., to learn the first
lesson in self- realization, is what we call the dharma of national
service. What have our patriotic leaders been teaching us? That we
should not fear even a king, that we are men and men need fear God
alone. Neither King George V nor his representatives can inspire fear
in them. The Lokamanya had abandoned all fear of the State’s
machinery of law and order and, therefore, he was the adored of the
people, even of learned men, for he inspired them with courage.
Deshbandhu had also completely shed fear of the Government. To his
mind, the Viceroy and the gate-keeper were equal. He had seen with
his inner eye that, everything considered, there was no difference
between the two. If it is unmanly to fear the Viceroy, so is it to
try to overcome the gate- keeper. There is a profound spiritual
vision behind this attitude, and that is the meaning of the dharma of
national service. For this reason, consciously or unconsciously and
even against their will, people look with reverence upon those who
follow this dharma. The Lokamanya was a Brahmin. His knowledge of the
scriptures was such as humbled the pride of pundits. But he was not
adored for that knowledge of his. Deshbandhu was not a Brahmin. He
was a Vaisya. But people never thought about what caste he belonged
to. Deshbandhu did not know Sanskrit and had not studied the
scriptures. He merely followed the dharma of national service. He had
made himself completely fearless. That is why even learned men bowed
to him and, on that  unforgettable day, they mingled their tears with
the people’s. The dharma of national service means all-embracing
love. It is not universal love, but it is an important facet of it.
It is not the Dhavalgiri of love, but its Darjeeling. From
Darjeeling, the visitor has a golden vision of Dhavalgiri and thinks
to himself : ‘If the Darjeeling of love is so beautiful as this,
how much more beautiful must be its Dhavalgiri, which shines in the
distance before me.’ Love of one’s country is not</p>

opposed to love of mankind, but is a concrete instance of it. It
ultimately lifts one to the highest peak of universal love. That is
why people shower blessings on those who are filled with patriotic
love. People know love of family, and are not, therefore, moved to
admiration by it. To some extent they also understand love of the
village. But love of the country only a Deshbandhu or a Lokamanya
understands. People adore such men because they themselves want to be
like them.</p>

Deshbandhu’s liberality knew no restraints. He earned lakhs and
spent lakhs. He never refused to give, even borrowed and gave. He
fought for the poor in courts without charging any fees. It is said

If he opposed me, it was certainly not that he wanted to harass me or
undermine my position; he did so only for the sake of national
service. He, who did not fear the Viceroy, was not likely to be
afraid of me. His attitude was that if the activities of even his
brother obstructed the progress of the country, he would oppose him.
This should be the attitude of all of us. Our differences were like
the differences between brothers. Neither of us wanted to part
company with the other for ever. If we did, we would have shown
ourselves wanting in patriotism. Hence, even when we seemed to drift
away from each other, we were drawing closer. Our situation was a
test of the quality of our hearts. Deshbandhu has passed that test,
but I have still to show that I have passed it. I must keep
undiminished my love for Deshbandhu and for other co-workers. If I
fail in that, I shall have failed in the test.</p>

thought, I would have to plead with many. I could explain  my
problems to him and seek his help to solve them. Instead, I would now
have to discuss them with several leaders, and even then, I knew,
they would not be able to solve them. The time had come when I had to
wipe their tears.</p>

The passing away of Deshbandhu has left me in greater difficulties.
Deshbandhu meant Bengal. His consent was as good as a draft in my
hand which I could cash without further difficulty. So far, my
difficulties at the passing of Deshbandhu are similar to those at the
passing away of the Lokamanya. But when the latter died, the path
before us was clear. People had been filled with new hopes. They
wanted to try their strength and make new experiments. Hindus and
Muslims seemed to have become united.</p>

But what is the position now? The sky overhead and the earth below. I
have no fresh ideas to put forward. Hindus and Muslims are getting
ready to fight each other. In the name of religion, they seem to have
forgotten the dharma of national service. Brahmins and non- Brahmins
are also fighting with each other. The Government believes that it
can now do what it likes in the country. Civil disobedience seems to
be far away. At this time, one would feel the passing of any</p>

However, I believe in God and therefore, have not lost heart. God may
sport with us as He wills. Why should we be miserable or happy
because of anything He may do? Why should it make any difference to
us if events over which we have no control end in one way rather than
in another? I understand my duty. Maybe my understanding of it is
wrong, but so long as I am convinced that it is my duty I should do
it, and when I have done it my responsibility is over. I console
myself with such attempts at philosophical reflection. My selfishness
simply does not let me forget that I shall see Deshbandhu no more.</p>

But how can Deshbandhu die? His physical frame has passed away. But
can his virtues die? They still live. If we but cultivate them in
ourselves, he lives in all of us. One who has served the world can
never die. It is wrong to say that Rama and Krishna have left this
world. Both live in the hearts of the thousands of their devotees.
The same is true of Harishchandra<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

others. By Harishchandra we do not mean his physical body; we mean
truth. He still lives in countless Harishchandras who serve truth. So
does Deshbandhu. His mortal body has perished. His spirit of service,
his liberality, his love of the country, his self-sacrifice, his
fearlessness—can we say that these, too, have perished? They will
go on increasing in strength among the people, whether in greater or
smaller measure.</p>

I have known Basanti Devi since the year 1919. I came closer to her
in 1921. I had heard a great deal about her goodness, her
intelligence and her hospitality, and also had some experience  of
them. As I drew closer to Deshbandhu in Darjeeling, so did I to
Basanti Devi. In her widowhood, I have come much closer to her. I
have been practically by her side from the day they came from
Darjeeling to Calcutta with Deshbandhu’s body. My first meeting
with her as a widow was in her son-in-law’s house. She sat
surrounded by a number of women. In the old days, as soon as I
entered the house she herself would come out to receive and welcome
me. Now that she was a widow, who would talk to me? I had to
recognize her in the midst of all those women sitting as still as
statues. For a minute, my eyes searched for her. Vermilion at the
parting of the hair, <i>tika </i>on the forehead, betel-leaf in the
mouth, bangles on the wrists, a bordered sari and a smiling
face—without any of these signs how could I recognize Basanti Devi?
I went and sat where I thought she should be and scanned the face.
The sight was too much. Yes, I recognized the face. I found it
difficult to keep back my tears, let alone hardening my heart and
offering consolation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Where was today the usual smile on her face? I tried in many ways to
console her, to cheer her up and make her speak. After a long time I
succeeded a little.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">Devi
smiled faintly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
That gave me courage and I said, “You cannot weep. If you do,
others also will weep. We have quietened Mona (elder daughter) with
the utmost difficulty. As for Baby (younger daughter) you know her
condition. Sujata (daughter-in-law) has been crying uncontrollably
and has barely stopped. You should have compassion on these. We want
you to do many things yet.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The brave woman replied with great firmness of mind : “I will not
weep. How can I, when tears don’t come?” I understood what this
meant and was satisfied. Crying lightens the heart. But this bereaved
sister did not want to lighten her grief. She wanted to bear the
burden. So, why should she weep? How could I say, now : “Come, let
us brother and sister weep and pour out our grief to each other?”</p>

A Hindu widow is an image of suffering. She has taken upon herself
the misery of the world. She has learnt to find happiness in
suffering, has accepted suffering as sacred.</p>

Devi had no objection to eating any type of food. In the</p>

period of her life up to 1920, all manner of delicacies were cooked
in her kitchen and hundreds of people feasted in her house. She could
not go without <i>pan </i>even for an hour. A box containing
betel-leaves was always to be found with her.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
And, now, she has given up all adornment, given up betel-leaves,
sweet dishes and meat and fish too. All the time, her thoughts are
fixed on her husband and on God.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I plead with many women to pay less attention to adorning their
person, ask many of them to give up addictions. Rarely does any give
up these things. But think what a widow does? The moment a Hindu
woman becomes a widow, she gives up addictions and lays aside
jewellery and other adornments as the snake casts off its slough. She
needs neither persuasion nor help from anyone for doing that. Is
there anything which custom does not make easy?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Is it a virtue or a sin to suffer in this way? We do not find this
practice among the followers of any other religion. Could the authors
of the Hindu Shastras have made a mistake? When I see Basanti Devi, I
do not think they have; I see in the practice the purest  spirit  of 
dharma. The widow’s manner of life is the glory of Hinduism. Let
the world say what it will, the life of dharma has its glory in
renunciation, not in enjoyment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
But what is that widow’s life which the Hindu Shastras admire and
praise? Certainly not that of the fifteen-year-old girl who does not
know even the meaning of marriage. For a girl married and widowed in
childhood, a widow’s life means not virtue, but sin. If the god of
love should himself try to tempt Basanti Devi, he would be burnt to
ashes. Basanti Devi has a third eye, like Siva’s. But what does a
fifteen-year-old girl know about the beauty of widowhood? For her,
such a life is cruelty. In the increasing number of such widows, I
see the destruction of Hinduism. In women like Basanti Devi leading
the customary life of widows, I see a source of strength for dharma.
There is no inviolable law that in all circumstances, in all places
and at all times a widow must remain a widow and lead a widow’s
life. This is a dharma only for a woman who can follow it.</p>

There should be the same rule for men as for women. Rama acted in
this manner. He could not bear separation from Sita, whom</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
he had sent away. He himself sent her away and yet suffered for what
he had done. After she had left, he gradually lost the light and
power which were his. He abandoned Sita physically, but installed her
as the queen of his heart. From that time onwards, he felt no
interest in dressing himself well or in other kingly pleasures. He
attended, disinterestedly, to the affairs of his kingdom as a matter
of duty and lived a peaceful life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
Hinduism will remain imperfect as long as men do not accept suffering
as Basanti Devi did and, like her, withdraw their interest from the
pleasures of this life. Sweets to the one and thorns to the other—
such perverted justice can never be, and is not, acceptable in God’s
court. But among the Hindus at present, disregarding the divine law,
men have ordained perpetual widowhood for women and conferred on
themselves the right to fix marriage with another partner, on the
cremation-ground itself.</p>

Basanti Devi has not till now shed a drop of tear in anyone’s
presence. Even then, the light on her face has not returned. It seems
as dull as if she had recovered from a long illness. Seeing her in
this condition, I requested her to go out with me for a little fresh
air. She did come along with me and sat in the car but did not speak
a word. I talked about many things. She listened, but hardly said
anything in reply. She had a drive, but felt miserable afterwards.
She could not sleep the whole night. “Cursed that I am, I enjoyed
today what was so dear to me. Is this all that my grief comes to?”
She spent the whole night in such thoughts. Bhombal (her son) came
and told me about this. Today is my silence day. I simply wrote on a
piece of paper : “We must cure mother of this madness. There are
many things which our beloved one may have loved and which we have no
choice but to do. Mother did not have a drive for enjoyment, she had
it for the sake of her health. She was in great need of fresh air. We
must strengthen her and take care of her health. We must keep her
alive so that we may be worthy of the legacy of Father’s work and
carry  it  forward. Convey this to Mother.”</p>

I realize the truth of these words everywhere here in Bengal. It is
only recently that we thought of going into the villages. At first,
we wanted things from the village people. It is only now that we are
going to the villages in order to give the people something. How can
we expect to win their confidence in such a short time? It often
happens that a father takes years to win his son’s confidence. We
have to win back our honoured place among the village people, and
will get nothing through impatience. Some persons serve their own
interests under the guise of service. What other means do the village
people have, except experience, to distinguish between such persons
and genuine workers? Public workers, therefore, must cultivate
patience, forbearance, selflessness and such other virtues. The
masses can have no other knowledge but experience to guide them.</p>

	If I do not write this postcard, I am afraid, I may not be able to
	write at all. I have your beautiful letter. Your style and Gujarati
	both are excellent. It would be nice if you start writing something
	for <i>Y. </i><i>I. </i>and <i>N. J. </i>I am busy collecting funds.
	Krishnadas has not received the letters. It is good that Ba spins. I
	too cannot tell you the names and particulars of all the progeny of
	Ota Gandhi. It is well that you havestarted collecting this
	literature. I have heard that Uttamchand Bapa had six sons.
	Khushalbhai may be able to give you more information. Tell Bal
	Gangadhar that I am very happy that he has come. I have no
	misgivings whatever about him. Doing good to others never harms
	anyone. Even the mistakes of Balkrishna lead ultimately to his

	I have your letter. I have written something quite differently about
	Alwar this time. I am afraid it will take a little time to decide
	about my going there. I think it will be possible to go only in the
	beginning of August. I intend to pass the last week of July in the
	Ashram and then start the tour. I am sure you will come on the 16th.
	I hope you received the wires I sent there to you and to Sabarmati.</p>

	I have your letter. You should look out for various occasions to
	serve Father. As a matter of fact you hardly have to search for

him alive for a few days more. His generosity was boundless and his

with gratitude what Deshbandhu had done for them. He was confident
that the youth of Bengal would help him in raising a suitable

I speak often in the Ashram, but then it is before my own people;
they understand and bear with me. Moreover, as occasion arises, I
quote something from the <i>Gita</i>, and even then the talk would
not be called a religious discourse. To me religion means living in
the way prescribed by religion. A discourse may be in place
occasionally, but not every religious man can give one. It is true,
though, that anyone who gives such discourses should himself be a man
of dedicated religious life.</p>

The <i>Gita </i>is for me a perennial guide to conduct. From it I
seek support for all my actions and, if, in a particular case, I do
not find the needed support, I would refrain from the proposed action
or at any rate feel uncertain about it. So, when despite my
embarrassment I accepted the invitation to speak, I decided to say
something about the meaning of birth and death. Every time I have
suffered the loss of a relative or friend, I sought consolation in
the <i>Gita</i>; and the one thing it teaches is that death is
nothing to be mourned. If ever I have shed tears, it has been through
weakness, it was in spite of myself. When I think how I was shocked
at the news of Deshbandhu’s death and how tears welled up in my
eyes, I ascribe all that to my weakness. Let us look in the <i>Gita
</i>today for some comfort.</p>

I have often stated that the <i>Gita </i>is a great allegory. I
simply cannot think that the battle it describes  was  an  actual 
battle  bet-  ween two armies, and this belief of mine was confirmed
when I read the  <i>Mahabharata </i>in jail. The <i>Mahabharata
</i>itself seems to   me to be a great treatise on dharma. It
contains historical incidents, but it is not history. When, for
instance, we read about  <i>sarpasatra</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>1</i></font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>
</i></font></sup><i>,</i><i> </i>can we rest in its literal meaning ?
We should, then, have to swallow enough superstitions to choke us to
death. The poet himself has warned us so emphatically, that he is not
a historian. The <i>Gita</i>, then, describes the conflict within us;
it is true that for this purpose it has used some historical
incidents, but the aim behind them is to kindle a light in our hearts
and impel us to examine them with its help. When you reach the
concluding part of Chapter II, it becomes impossible even to suspect
that the poem describes a historical battle. It seems strange that
Arjuna should want to know the marks of a man firmly established in
spiritual vision and that the Lord should explain them to a person
all set for a battle.</p>

it never came into existence at all; the statement simply means that
it is transitory, perishable, that it is subject to change. And yet,
we live our life as if it would last for ever. We worship it, we
cling to it—all this is contrary to the teaching of Hinduism. If
Hinduism has asserted anything in the clearest possible terms, it is
that the body and all that we behold is <i>asat</i>. But there are
probably no other people who fear death and cry and grieve over it as
much as we do. In the <i>Mahabharata</i>, in fact, it is stated that
lamentation after someone’s death gives pain to the departed soul,
and the  <i>Gita</i>, too, was composed to remove the fear of death.

wears out through continuous activity and death releases it from
suffering. The more I think about the ceaselessly active life of
Deshbandhu, the more I feel that he is alive today. While he lived in
the body, he was not fully alive, but he is so today. In our
selfishness, we believed that his body was all that mattered, whereas
the <i>Gita </i>teaches—and I understand the truth of this more

meaningless, is so much waste of time.</p>

Non-Being simply does not exist, and Being never ceases to exist.

 good and the true alone live for ever. The world remembers only
those who did some good while they lived in it. It readily forgets
that which was false and evil, and preserves only what is good. Take
the example of Ramachandra. Personally, I believe him to be an
incarnation of God, but I do not believe that he was guilty of no
error while he lived in the body. Today, however, we regard him as
perfect. Krishna, too, we regard as the plenary incarnation of
Godhead. Among the millions of Hindus, you will not find today a
single person who will see error in anything which Rama or Krishna
did. This fact, too, reveals the meaning of the verse “What is
non-Being is never known to have been”. The world has preserved
only what was imperishable in them, and no one knows anything about
the perishable  elements—their errors, if they committed any. We
want to follow Deshbandhu’s example. Is it his life in the body
which we should follow as an example? Was it his body we adored? If
that was so, would his dear, dear son light the fire which consumed
it?</p>

And so, in that verse, the <i>Gita </i>declares in the most emphatic
language that we should follow truth in our lives and keep away from
the unreal and the false, from deception. Very often our words do not
express the truth, they become a form of deception. Anger is a form
of untruth, desire, attachment, pride; all these are forms of
untruth. We have to perform the <i>satra </i>of all these snakes. A
living snake harms only the body, but these snakes infect every fibre
in our being and threaten to harm even the <i>atman</i>. This,
however, is never harmed. It never dies. If we know what is meant by
<i>sat</i>, we shall also understand the real meaning of birth and
death. The chemists say that when a</p>

candle burns nothing is destroyed; similarly, when the body dies and
is consumed by fire, nothing is destroyed. Birth and death are two
conditions of the same reality. It is wholly because of our
selfishness that we lament the death of our dear one. When on that
day I saw the crowds on the cremation-ground and observed no sigh of
grief on their faces, for a moment I felt irritated, angry because
they seemed to lack sense and did not even understand the gravity of
the hour. But a little later I realized that it was they who were
right. They had come there not with any selfish motive but merely to
honour a noble life, to bear testimony to Deshbandhu’s services and
express their admiration for the supreme achievement of his life.
Their joy had more truth and meaning in it than our grief. All
admiration to the revered Basanti Devi, whom I did not even recognize
when I first met her [after Deshbandhu’s death], because she shed
no tears before me. However, even one’s face should not be touched
with grief, one should have no feeling of sadness or gloom. Only if
we have such a faith can it be said that we have understood the
transitoriness of the body. It is not to the body that one is
married. In marriage, two souls come together not to seek bodily
pleasure but to strive for their own growth and refinement. When the
body of one partner disappears, the union becomes all the closer. We
have assembled today, therefore, not to shed tears. Let us, rather,
think of Deshbandhu’s virtues, the substance of his which will
never die, and take them into our own lives.</p>

becoming physically weaker. The reasons are obvious. Our growing
poverty and early marriages are two substantial causes for the decay.
The one can be remedied by the charkha and the other by individuals
resolutely refusing to marry their children, whether male or female,
till they are over sixteen and nearer twenty. The later the better. I
would run almost every imaginable risk and postpone marriage till a
boy or girl is well advanced and is capable of shouldering the burden
and is perfectly healthy. The way to do it is for those who feel the
necessity of reform to initiate it themselves and advocate it among
their neighbours. Those who desire the reform and would  minimize
chances of risk must bring up their children in healthier and purer
surrounding than they have at present.</p>

rebuke mentioned was the last to be received and it has proved the
proverbial last straw. There is a telegram before me asking me to
request the Mussalmans not to kill cows as sacrifice on <i>Bakr-Id. </i>I
thought it was time for me at least to offer an explanation over my
silence. I was prepared to live down the charge regarding Panditji,
although it was a charge brought by a dear friend. He was almost
apprehensive about my fame. He thought I would be accused of fear of
Mussalmans and what not. But I was firm in my resolve not to take any
public notice of the ban on Panditji. There was no fear of his
misunderstanding me. And I knew that he stood in no need of my
protection. He will survive all the bans that can be declared against
him by any temporal power. His philosophy is his stay.  I  have 
watched him at close quarters amid many a crisis. He has stood
unmoved. He knows his work and prosecutes it without elation or
perturbation in fair weather or foul. I, therefore, laughed  to  my
heart’s content when I heard of the ban. Strange are the ways of
potentates. Nothing that I could write in the pages of <i>Young </i><i>India
</i>would, I knew, induce H.E.H. the Nizam to recall his fiat. If I
had the honour of a personal acquaintance, I would have straightway
written to the ruler of Hyderabad respectfully telling him that the
ban on Panditji could do no good to his State, much less to Islam. I
would have even advised him to offer Panditji his hospitality when he
went to Hyderabad and could have cited such example from the lives of
the Prophet and his companions. But I do not possess that honour. And
I knew that a public reference by me might not even reach his ears.
Save, therefore, for adding to the acerbity already existing, it
could have served no purpose. And as I could not add to it, even if I
could not diminish it, I chose to be silent. And my present reference
I propose to use for the sake of advising such Hindus as would listen
to me not to feel irritated over the incident nor to make it a cause
of complaint against Islam or Mussalmans. It is not the Mussalman in
the Nizam that is responsible for the ban. Arbitrary procedure is an
attribute of autocracy whether it be Hindu or Mussalman. We must
devise means of checking autocratic vagaries without seeking to
destroy the Indian States. The remedy is cultivation of enlightened
and forceful public opinion. The process must begin, as it has begun,
in    British   India   proper;    because    it    is    naturally  
 freer, being</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
administered directly, unlike the States which  are  administered
through the vassals of the Emperor. They, therefore, reproduce the
evils of the British system without containing the few safeguards
that direct British administration provides for its own sake. In the
Indian States, therefore, orderliness depends more upon  the personal
character and whims of the chiefs for the time being than upon the
constitution or rather the constitutions under which the States’
government is regulated. It follows, therefore, that real reform of
the States can only come when the chilling control of the British
Imperial system is at least tempered by the freedom of British India
secured by the disciplined power of the people. Not that, therefore,
all the journals have to observe silence. Reference to abuses in the
States is undoubtedly a necessary part of journalism, and it is a
means of creating public opinion. Only, my scope is strictly limited,
I have taken up journalism not for its sake but merely as an aid to
what I have conceived to be my mission in life. My mission is to
teach by example and precept under severe restraint the use of the
matchless weapon of satyagraha which is direct corollary of
non-violence and truth. I am anxious, indeed I am impatient, to
demonstrate that there is no remedy for the many ills of life save
that of non-violence. It is a solvent strong enough to melt the
stoniest heart. To be true to my faith, therefore, I may not write in
anger or malice. I may not write idly. I may not write merely to
excite passion. The reader can have no idea of the restraint I have
to exercise from week to week in the choice of topics and my
vocabulary. It is a training for me. It enables me to peep into
myself and make discoveries of my weaknesses. Often my vanity
dictates a smart expression or my anger a harsh adjective. It is a
terrible ordeal but a fine exercise to remove these weeds. The reader
sees the pages of <i>Young India </i>fairly well dressed up and
sometimes with Romain Rolland, he is inclined to say ‘what a fine
old man this must be’. Well, let the world understand that the
fineness is carefully and prayerfully cultivated. And if it has
proved acceptable to some whose opinion I cherish, let the reader
understand that when that fineness has become perfectly natural,
i.e., when I have become incapable of evil and when nothing harsh or
haughty occupies, be it momentarily, my thought-world, then and not
till then, my non- violence will move all the hearts of all the
world. I have placed before me and the reader no impossible ideal or
ordeal. It is  man’s prerogative and birthright. We have lost the
paradise only to regain it. If it takes time, then it is but a speck
in the complete time-circle. The</p>

But I must hasten to the end. The reader knows now why I have been
silent about Alwar. I have no data to go upon. Alwar can laugh with
as much disdain as the Nizam at anything I may say or write. If all
the reports that are published are true, they are proof of Dyerism
double distilled. But I know that I have for the moment no remedy. I
watch with admiration the effort to the Press to secure at least a
decent public inquiry into the awful allegations. I note the silent
movement of Panditji’s diplomacy cutting its gentle way. Why need I
bother then? Let those who appeal to me for prescriptions know that I
am not an infallible <i>kaviraj </i>with an inexhaustible
pharmacopoeia. I am a humble, groping specialist with hardly two
indistinguishable drugs in my little pocket. The specialist pleads
present incapacity to deal with the evils complained of.</p>

the all-India memorial is not quite so easy a matter. The delay is

I appreciate the letter as it expects from me the utmost accuracy of
statement and scrupulous impartiality. I am anxious to live up to the
expectation as far as it is humanly possible. But, in spite of all my
care, I may do an injustice to some and may be unduly biassed in
favour of others; after all both are injustices in the long run. A
man or an institution that is undeservedly belauded may even suffer
more than the one unjustly decried. But in the case in point I have
been most guarded. And whilst almost everything that the secretary
says may have been true at one time, it was not true at the time I
wrote. I was not adjudging the relative merits of the institutions
named nor comparing their account. I merely stated that, at the time
of writing there were so many khaddar-producing institutions which I 
had visited. I included in these Satsang Ashram, though it was the
latest recruit. I saw more than 40 wheels going when I visited the
Ashram. Among those spinning were the relatives of the founder,
including his wife. I was shown too, khaddar woven at the place. But
above all, Deshbandhu, at whose instance I visited the Ashram, had
told me that the founder had decided to make spinning and production
of khaddar one of its principal activities. The manager who was my
guide during my visit confirmed that statement. I would have been
unjust if I had not, after all this evidence before me, included the
Ashram as one of the khaddar centres. I admit that, at the present
moment, there can be no comparison between the Satsang Ashram and the
Abhoy Ashram. The letter is as old as, if not older than, the Khadi
Pratishthan and was founded chiefly for khaddar and the wheel. Its
production is only next to that of Khadi Pratishthan, and [it] has
branches in several parts. But my purpose in writing the article in
question was not to examine the relative merits, but to bring to the
notice of the public the</p>

You are too philosophical and too abstruse for me. We must for the
time being, therefore, agree to differ and pray for each other till
we meet some day in the course of my wanderings. Your decision to add
carding to spinning appeals to me most forcibly. I hope that you will
make discoveries of the hidden powers of the spinning-wheel and the
carding-bow. You can infect your surrounding, too, with your zeal for
spinning and, if it becomes successful, as it can be, when all who
are ready-made revolutionaries or who are on the verge of it or are
in the making, devote their undoubted talents and energy to the great
task, they will find that a bloody revolution is not necessary for
our country’s salvation. Let these friends of mine help me to make
the spinning-wheel hum, let them help me to make the villagers busy

Friends have pressed it upon me that, in the interest of the Memorial
Fund that is being collected, it is necessary for me not to leave
Calcutta at the present moment for the projected tour. Whilst I
recognize the usefulness of my presence, after comparing notes with
Satcowri Babu, I have come to the conclusion that the tour already
advertised ought not to be abandoned. After all, the collections that
are pouring in come from thousands of grateful hearts. Personally I
have never entertained the slightest doubt about the response  of
Bengal. We are not an ungrateful nation, and Bengal is not [to] be
surpassed by any province in gratefulness. Given the proper cause,
Bengal is capable of rising to the highest height. And what cause can
be more proper and sacred, more insistent, than a memorial in honour
of Deshbandhu? I do not, therefore, regard my presence in Calcutta as
essential for ensuring the continuous flow, and shall carry out the
tour in the full confidence that the subscriptions will continue with</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
unabated perseverance, until the whole of the sum of ten lakhs is
made up. I see that, at the time of writing this note, the total
collections amount to over Rs. 2,40,000, of which over Rs. 61,000/-,
being today’s collection, has to be still delivered to the
treasurer. If anything like the present rate of progress
continues—and there is no reason why it ought not to—we shall
reach ten lakhs by the middle of this month. That we were not able to
collect the whole sum by the end of June means no reflection on
Bengal. It was possible, but only just possible, to complete the
collection in the eight days that  were available. It pre-supposed a
perfect organization or ability and willingness on the part of a few
to find the whole sum. I can almost say that, where ever I have gone,
I have gone, I have found the will to pay, but owing to the great
depression in trade, the ability to pay large sums has been lacking.
And it must be frankly confessed that nowhere in India are we
sufficiently organized to reach the names for small collections
amongst them in a short time. It is a magnificient tribute to
Deshbandhu’s memory that, with the very imperfect organization that
the Committee have been able to bring into being, small sums are
pouring in such a manner as to keep at least six workers at work,
receiving monies from early morning to 10 o’clock at night and even
later, not to mention a number of clerks that Sir Rajendra Nath has
put on the work of receiving subscriptions and copying the very long
lists, containing the names of subscribers, of annas, pice and even
half pice. Whilst, therefore, I shall undertake to finish the balance
of the Bengal tour without any misgivings, I wish to notify it to the
friends who have invited me to different places mentioned in the tour
programme, that my principal work in the tour will be to deliver the
living message of the late patriot and to collect subscriptions for
the memorial. And I hope that they will so arrange the programme in
the respective places as to enable maximum amounts to be collected. I
trust that they will not spend much money on reception arrangements.
I suggest that all decoration will be carefully eschewed and the
collections made for reception be saved to the utmost extent possible
and be devoted to the Memorial Fund, as is already being done in
North Calcutta. I would like here gratefully to mention the fact that
telegraphic and postal money orders are pouring in from all parts of
Bengal and all other parts of India where Bengalis are domiciled.</p>

It was a grand sight—the mass meeting on the Maidan. The
arrangements made by the volunteers were perfect. Not a man moved
from his seat up to the time of the passing of the resolution in
solemn silence, the whole of the great audience standing for full one
minute. I have never witnessed in Bengal a meeting so dignified, so
solemn and so respectful. I tender my congratulations to those who
gathered at the Maidan and the volunteers who carried out the
arrangements. I am sorry that I was unable to attend the Town Hall
meeting, much as I had intended to. I was detained for over an hour,
i.e., up to 7.45 at the ladies’ meeting. This meeting was a
wonderful sight. In response to the appeal made to them, they rained
gold bangles, rings  and necklaces. Besides over Rs. 500/-, sixty
gold bangles, six chains,  sixteen rings, some of them studded, and
over twenty ear-rings were given by these devoted daughters of India.
I hope that the ladies of Calcutta will continue the work begun at
the meeting and those who had no chance of attending the meeting will
send in their quota. The simplest of collecting among the ladies is
for those who care to collect only amongst friends. I understand that
there has been on previous occasions a great deal of fraudulent
collection on the part of unauthorized persons; and as even authority
has been found to have been manufactured, the Committee has not
shouldered the responsibility of issuing letters of authority to
ladies. It is for that reason that I lay emphasis upon those who
will, collecting only  amongst their friends, so as to avoid all
possibility of fraud.</p>

At about 4 p.m. whilst I was attending a meeting of signatories to
the Memorial, Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta gave the meeting the information
that , there was a man waiting outside with a report of a serious
riot in the coolie lines at Kidderpore dock. We immediately asked the
man to come inside and, hearing his report, I suggested to Mr. Sen
Gupta that he might telephone and enquire what the matter really was.
He, however, preferred to motor himself and find out the situation
and on reaching there, the scene of trouble, he sent  a  telephone
message to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Saheb asking him to go there and
take me with him. Maulana Saheb came and we immediately motored. This
was about 5.30 p.m. On the way, we f ound a large number of
Mussalmans in an excited state saying that</p>

many Mussalmans had been killed. They had lathis with them. Maulana
Saheb pacified them and told them that he and I were going to
investigate and that, whatever had happened, they must not think of
taking revenge for what they might consider wrong done by Hindus.
They listened to Maulana Saheb and consented to disperse. On reaching
the gate, we met Mr. Sen Gupta who told us that when he arrived
there, there was a free fight going on which was stopped with some
difficulty. Police were guarding the approaches and the compound
seemed to have been cleared of strangers. We then went to Coolie
barracks and on the way met a large crowd of Hindus armed with
lathis. Upon enquiring, they said they had gathered there in self-
defence as they were afraid of being attacked by Mussalmans. I spoke
to them at some length and told them that the information at our
disposal went to show that Hindus had mercilessly assaulted
Mussalmans who were numerically much weaker than they. And I told
them that, if they had done wrong, they should apologize. One of them
said that a cow was killed in the lines contrary to custom and that
enraged the coolies. We then went to the spot where the cow was said
to have been killed. Upon reaching, we found there was no trace
whatsoever of any cow having been killed on the spot that was shown
to us. There were parts of a carcass without the skin. Mussalmans
present told us that the cow was killed in a mosque and the meat,
after the skinning, was brought to their homes in their carriage.
There was no blood or any other mark of slaughter. The Commissioner 
of  Police, Mr. Tegart, was present whilst we were making enquiry. So
far as I can judge the blame appears to me to be wholly that of
Hindus. I told accordingly, and I did not find any serious
contradiction. The Hindus even asked for forgiveness of Mussalmans
and said that they would not repeat the wrong. Up to that time,
according to information in the possession of the Commissioner of
Police, no deaths had occurred, though, among many injured
Mussalmans, two were in a serious state. Maulana Saheb pacified the
Mussalmans and told them that they ought not to give any credence to
exaggerated reports and up to that time no one had died. He asked
them all to disperse quietly which they consented to do. Assuming the
truth of what we heard and saw, there is no doubt that Hindu coolies
were entirely in the wrong and that they had hurt innocent Mussalmans
and made themselves responsible for at least one death which, as I
now understand, has occurred. It is terrible to contemplate that,

representative, there is not a single</p>

It is necessary to correct the language of this letter. I do not
remember to have said that we need not be concerned even if a
satyagrahi is unjustified in his satyagraha. There is risk of harm in
every wrong step. But I have certainly said that, if a satyagrahi is
in the wrong, he himself will have to suffer, and he will deserve to
suffer. A satyagrahi is not to be held responsible for the suffering
which may be caused to the person against whom his satyagraha is
directed, for a satyagrahi never wishes to inflict suffering on the
other party. If the latter feels hurt or suffers, the satyagrahi need
not blame himself. If I start a fast with a pure motive and the fast
causes suffering to my co- workers, I must resign myself to that.</p>

In the case imagined [in the letter], a father is said to be angry. A
satyagrahi will never become angry and, if he does become in spite of
himself, he will, till his anger has subsided and he has recovered
his composure, take no step which may have an effect on the person
who</p>

is the cause of his anger. Should the satyagrahi, after long and
careful deliberation, still think that what his parents have done is
wrong, he may certainly try to rectify it, maintaining the utmost
respect towards them while doing so; if, in spite of his respectful
behaviour, they commit suicide, he need not feel troubled in his
conscience. The parents alone would be to blame if in their folly
they kill themselves. Why should a son hold himself responsible if
his parents invite suffering on themselves by their own actions? If
they ask him to do something which is a sin and, on his refusing to
obey, they commit suicide, how is he to blame? Prahlad continued to
repeat the name of God. This enraged Hiranyakashipu who in the end
was destroyed. Prahlad is in no way to be held responsible for this
result. Rama honoured his father’s word and in the event Dasharatha
died; the former is not, on that account, to be held guilty of
Dasharatha’s death. The subjects were submerged in a sea of grief
but Rama hardened his heart and kept his pledge. So did Bhishma
despite the intense suffering of Satyavati<font size="2">.</font><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>The main thing to be borne in mind about this matter
is that the urge for satyagraha does not come from anyone. It must be
spontaneous. Rama did not consult his elders and  gurus before
deciding to go and dwell in the forest. In fact, there were enough
priests who told him that he would be committing a sin by going to
dwell in the forest, and would commit none by refusing to go. But he
followed what he thought was his duty, and went to the forest, and
thereby won immortal fame. In this unhappy land of ours, people have
become impotent to such an extent that on the flimsiest excuse
persons threaten to kill themselves or fast unto death. We must not
submit to such threats, even when we have reason to believe that they
are likely to be carried out. I have often explained in <i>Navajivan
</i>the difference between a fast which is satyagraha and a fast
which is <i>duragraha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup>.</p>

lead, and help his wife to lead, a life of pleasure with dancing and
drinking and foreign things to wear. Likewise, on awakening he will
reform his life and also want the wife to reform hers. One needs to
exercise discretion in this matter. The accepted idea in society is
that the wife should follow the husband. But a husband has certainly
no right to compel his wife or a father his children in matters like
this. Anyone who, having himself adopted khadi, forces his wife and
adult sons and daughters to do the same commits a sin. The person is
not bound, however, to buy foreign cloth for them to wear. Grown-up
sons, if they are not happy with the situation, may separate from the
father. The wife’s position is difficult. It is not so easy for her
to leave the husband. She is generally incapable of supporting
herself. I can, therefore, conceive situations in which, if the wife
is not ready to follow the husband, it may be the latter’s duty to
buy foreign cloth for her. Giving up the use of foreign cloth is like
changing one’s religion. There is, and can be, no rule that every
time the husband changes religion the wife too should change hers. 
The husband should let his wife follow her own religion or way of
life, and <i>vice versa</i>. In such a case, therefore, the husband
will agree to buy foreign cloth for his wife not because he has
submitted to her threat, but because he knows it would be wrong to
compel her to do anything against her own wishes. Suppose that the
wife not only wants foreign cloth for herself, but also wants the
husband to wear it and threatens to kill herself if he does not
agree. The husband must not submit to such a threat.</p>

I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that the son should not
respect the practice of untouchability even if his conduct causes the
utmost suffering to his father. The caution I gave when discussing
the first case is relevant here too. This hard-hearted advice is not
meant for one who has come to believe that the practice of
untouchability is a sin because he has read it so described in my
articles. It is meant only for those who are themselves convinced of
its being a sin. The point is that so long as one holds an idea as an
intellectual belief and no more, one must not disregard  the  duty,
which has reference to the heart, of obeying one’s parents. If
Prahlad had learnt to repeat Rama’s name at someone’s suggestion,
it would have been his duty to stop repeating it when forbidden by
his father.</p>

I do not believe that it is the duty of a husband or a wife to
gratify his or her partner’s desire. It is a kind of coercion for
either partner to compel the other to share in his or her weakness. 
A husband and a wife have no right to use coercion in their relations
with each other. Desire is like fire. It consumes human beings as
fire consumes hay. Light one blade in a stack of hay and the whole
will be on fire. We need not take the trouble of lighting all the
blades one by one. When one partner is overcome with desire, the
other is bound to be affected. I bow in all reverence to the husband
or the wife who is not so affected.</p>

Pupils are taught astronomy in schools which teach English, — or
they were in my time. It was not to be expected that the subject
should figure in schools which taught only Gujarati. In teaching it,
however, it never occurred to the teacher to point to the stars in
the sky. Even if a teacher thought of doing so, what could he teach?
If asked by someone to point out the planet Mars, I certainly doubt
whether he could have done so. As, however, the study of astronomy
means learning to recognize the planets and the stars moving in the
heavens, the subject should be taught by directly pointing these out.</p>

come out of it without delay. He should get hold of a book which will
teach him astronomy interestingly, and go through it. If necessary,
he may write to the Gujarat Vidyapith to inquire from where he may
order it. If he does not get the required information from that
source, or is told that no such book is available, he may stop
contributing money to the Vidyapith if he has been doing so. If, on
the other hand, he succeeds in finding the book, he should contribute
something now even in case he has hitherto contributed nothing.</p>

The scriptures say that, as a man abandons an old house and goes to
live in a new one, so the <i>atman </i>dwelling in a body aban- dons 
it when it grows old, builds another and lives in that. As one does
not feel happy when leaving one’s old house, because of long
association with it, likewise the soul is not happy when leaving the
body because of the association, even if the legs are swollen and
look like pillars, the body is emaciated into a mere skeleton and the
man struggles for breath. But one forgets the old house when the new
one is ready and the soul, too, when it has a new home to dwell in,
retains no memory at all of the old—such is the mystery of death
and birth. If this is so,</p>

If we wish Deshbandhu’s soul to have peace in its last journey,
there is only one thing we can do, and that is to develop in
ourselves as many of his virtues as we can. Some of them we certainly
can. All of us cannot command English like his or be lawyers of his
calibre or do the work he did in legislatures, but we can all have
his patriotism and cultivate generosity like his. We may not be able
to give as much money as he did, but anyone who gives to the best of
his means will have given enough. A copper coin given by a widow
counts far more than the thousands a Maharaja may give from the
crores in his possession. After he had started wearing khadi,
Deshbandhu never used any other cloth for his dress either at home or
in public. Shall we not start wearing khadi? Deshbandhu never
demanded fine khadi. He preferred coarse khadi. He tried to learn
spinning. Will those who have not started spinning do so?</p>

At present, money is being collected for a memorial to him in Bengal.
But will it be right not to have an all-India memorial? Since all of
us are busy here with the collection for Bengal, I have not been able
to consult friends. But I have been thinking about the matter in my
own mind. As for the kind of memorial it should be, I have
Deshbandhu’s trust-deed with me. This is not written down, as the
written will for the memorial in Bengal, but it is as good as a
written testament. I shall say no more about it in this issue; my
appeal will have come out before the next issue.</p>

The reader should get ready to loosen his purse strings. Since people
will be asked to contribute only as much  as  their  means permit, no
one need get nervous. Deshbandhu gave money not out of fear but of
his own free will; he enjoyed giving. If he threw up a practice worth
millions, it was with no painful effort of will; he did so because he
found it unbearable to continue it. Let no one, therefore, feel
nervous at my suggestion. With the progressive awakening in the
country, every time there is a calamity, people will have to part
with some share of their earnings; they should be ready to do so
willingly. That is not love which merely sheds tears and does no 
more. Profession without action, is no love; it is but empty words.
Love gives, and acts, without talking. One who loves his father does
not go about, like a bard, praising the father’s virtues; he
preserves his legacy,</p>

improves upon it and adds to it. A father’s best property consists
in his virtues, which the son cultivates in himself and so brings
credit both to the father and to himself. In the same way, we who are
Deshbandhu’s heirs must contribute what we can to enhance what he
has left behind.</p>

There is a special bond of regard between the Gujaratis and me. I
have a way of saying harsh things, and the country has put up with
it. It is to the Gujaratis, however, that I say the harshest things.
They do not misunderstand me, but take my words in the right spirit,
regard them as the salutary doses of a  <i>vaid</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
 love  me  all  the  more  for them. I had this experience with the
Gujaratis in Calcutta last week. They had called a meeting to express
condolence on the death of Deshbandhu.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
     </font></sup>I   was  invited   to   attend   and   preside  
over   it.   The organizers had also promised me that they would make
a collection. I saw that there had been no collection. I was,
therefore, forced to say a few harsh things. We do well in holding a
condolence meeting; but there should be only one, not too many. There
had been one on the day on which Deshbandhu died, and again on July 1
there will be meetings in the whole country. There can be, therefore,
only one reason for holding a meeting in between, confined to a
particular community and that reason must be to start some
constructive activity, namely to collect contributions for the fund.
Some activity of this kind is the best thing which Gujaratis,
Marwaris and other outsiders living in Bengal can take up. This is
what I said in my speech. It did not make the Gujaratis angry; on the
contrary, they understood my point and there was a shower of rupees
from the galleries in  the theatre in which the meeting was held, and
a sum of more than Rs. 6,000 was collected on the spot. If anyone
offered less than he should, there was no dearth of persons to rebuke
him. I have been told that there are still many persons who have not
given as much as they can. If it is so, I should like such persons to
make good the deficiency.</p>

his memorial. He said that Deshbandhu sacrificed his property and
life for the welfare of the young men and that he hoped and depended
much on them, specially the students. Mahatma said that the life of
that illustrious patriot might be divided into two parts— external
and internal. The external only tended to help the internal.
Deshbandhu wanted to increase the strength of the nation and free the
country. So far as the external was concerned, it was only for the
rich and the educated to follow, but as to the internal, it might be
cultivated alike by the rich and the poor, by the educated and the
illiterate, by the boy and the girl, by the young and the old. For
the last 6 or 9 months of his life, Deshbandhu tried to hold before
the public the ideal of village reorganization or village
reconstruction in which males and females of every age and grade in
society might take part.</font></font></p>

directed the attention of the students to this and said that the
foremost and easiest way of beginning work in the village is the
introduction of charkha in every household. He had long discussions
with Deshbandhu over this at Darjeeling and both of them agreed as
above, and the latter communicated the same to Babu Satcouripati Roy
only a few days before he expired. It is a pity, said the Mahatma,
that Deshbandhu was not among them too complete the programme he had
chalked out for his countrymen. He said that, if they had any love or
admiration for their Deshbandhu, they would take a vow to spin for at
least half an hour every day, never use any foreign cloth and take up
the work of village reconstruction in right earnest. In conclusion,
he appealed to the students to take the permission of their parents
and contribute whatever they could to the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund.
He asked them to give any gold buttons or articles of luxury they had
with them or curtail their daily expenditure, even by fasting, for
one, two or three days, if necessary, and contribute the savings to
the fund. This sort of sacrifice, he said, was not new to the
students, and that, during the last 30 or 40 years of his political
activity, he received such help from them on many occasions, notably
during the last Malabar flood relief. He, however, warned them that,
if this sacrifice on their part was not done with pleasure, he would

to the first question, although the evil of untouchability is not</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
merely a blot upon Hinduism, but is also a blot upon humanity, it is
a question which Hindus must solve for themselves, even as they are
solving several other questions regarding Hinduism. There is the
question of <i>devadasis</i>, for instance. Their existence is not a
small evil. The institution is a blot upon humanity. But no non-Hindu
thinks of medling with it in the same sense in which Hindus are. The
reason is obvious. Removal of these abuses has to come from within,
not imposed upon Hindus. This can only be brought about by Hindus.
Mussalmans, Christians and other non-Hindus are at perfect liberty to
criticize untouchability as any other evil in Hinduism. They can lend
the reform their moral support. But they may not go further without
exposing themselves to the charge of having designs upon Hinduism.</p>

As to the second charge, I must content myself with having noted it.
I cannot answer it without committing a breach of propriety. If I
have to prove to Mussalmans my concrete contribution to unity, it
follows that there is none. And I must, therefore, submit to the
condemnation that the question carries with it, till such time that
my <i>bona </i><i>fides </i>are self-proved. But, in fairness to the
Mussalmans in general, I must say that it is for the first time that
I have been called upon to produce a certificate of service. Let me
say, however, that they also serve who wait and pray. And if there
are many Mussalmans like the distinguished inquirer who want to
inspect my record of service, I ask them not to bother their heads
about it, but to be content with the assurance that I am at least
watching, waiting and praying, if I am not actively serving.</p>

cannot plead guilty. I have not criticized Ayurveda. I have
criticized those who have professed to follow it. I have not
criticized all of them, but I have criticized the large number who
make the pretensions I have accused them of. There is no
contradiction between my endorsement of proposition to promote
research in the indigenous drugs and plants and my condemnation of
the method adopted by some to these physicians, even as there is none
between my laying the foundation of the Ayurvedic College in Calcutta
and my warning to the <i>kavirajas</i>. It is open to the <i>vaidyas

shall be sorry for the decision, but the rejection will not alter my
opinion which is based on experience. I have chapter and verse for
every statement I have made. I do like everything that is ancient and
noble, but I utterly dislike a parody of it. And I must respectfully
refuse to believe that ancient books are the last word on the matters
treated in them. As a wise heir to the ancients,  I am desirous of
adding to and enriching the legacy inherited by us. Let me inform the
protestants that some <i>kavirajas </i>have welcomed my criticism,
which has set them thinking. Needless to say that it was not directed
against those who are carrying on scientific research in a spirit of
humility and without counting the cost. Only, they are too few to be
counted. I plead for an appreciable increase.</p>

This brief report has its own moral. The output is nothing compared
to what it should be or can be. But the effort shows how the
slightest inattention to detail hampers progress in every direction.
An organization is like machinery; just as, if the smallest screw
becomes loose, the whole machinery becomes loose and may even break
down, so in an organization the least looseness affects its smooth
working and the results expected. The brief experiment of three
months has a lesson for those who are dealing with the spinning
franchise.</p>

The price of this khaddar has not been reduced for the simple reason
that the quantity is too small to warrant reduction. And it was a

different from what the readers of <i>Young India </i>are accustomed

have had the same difficulties that have faced the American friend.
What is wanted is resolution at the back of one’s mind. It

</font></sup>was handed to me at Chittagong and has been in my
jacket, awaiting attention at the first opportunity. The reader is
aware how the attempt to wean the fallen sisters from their error has
apparently resulted in giving a passport to vice. Prostitution I knew
was a tremendous and a growing evil. The tendency to see virtue in
vice and excuse evil in the sacred name of art or some other false
sentiment has clothed this debasing indulgence with a kind of subtle
respectability which is responsible for the moral leprosy which he
who runs may see. But I was unprepared for the terrible state the
correspondent declares to exist. I fear that he has not exaggerated
the evil. For, during my tour, I have had corroboration from various
sources. Great as the evil is in this age of unbelief or a mere
mechanical belief in God and an age of multiplicity of comforts and
luxuries, almost reminding one of the degradation to which Rome had
descended when she was apparently at the zenith of her power, it is
not easy to prescribe a remedy. It cannot be remedied by law. London
is seething with the vice. Paris is notorious for its vice which has
almost become a fashion. If law would have prevented it, these highly
organized nations would have cured their capitals of the vice. No
amount of writing on the part of reformers like myself can deal with</p>

the evil in any appreciable form. The political domination of England
is bad enough. The cultural is infinitely worse. For, whilst we
resent and, therefore, endeavour to resist the political domination,
we hug the cultural, not realizing in our infatuation that, when the
cultural domination is complete, the political will defy resistance.
Let me not be misunderstood. I do not wish to imply that, before the
British rule, prostitution was unknown in India. But I do say that it
was not so rampant as now. It was confined to the few upper ten. Now
it is fast undoing the youth of the middle classes. My hope lies in
the youth of the country. Such of them as are prey to the vice are
not vicious by nature. They are helplessly and thoughtlessly drawn to
it. They must realize the harm that it has done them and society.
They must understand, too, that nothing but a rigorously disciplined
life will save them and the country from utter ruin. Above all,
unless they visualize God and seek His aid in keeping them from
temptation, no amount of dry discipline will do them much good. Truly
has the Seer said in the <i>Gita </i>that “desire persists though
man may by fasting keep his body under restraint. Desire goes only
when one has seen God face to face.” Seeing God face to face is to
feel that He is enthroned in our hearts even as a child feels a
mother’s affection without needing any demonstration. Does a child
reason out the existence of a mother’s love? Can he prove it to
other? He triumphantly declares : “It is.” So must it be with the
existence of God. He defies reason. But He is experienced. Let us not
reject the experience of Tulsidas, Chaitanya, Ramdas and a host of
other spiritual teachers even as do not reject that of mundane
teachers.</p>

The correspondent has inquired whether Congressmen may do the many
things he has enumerated, such as theatre-going, etc. I have already
remarked that man cannot be made good by law. If I had the power of
persuasion, I would certainly stop women of illfame from acting as
actresses, I would prevent people from drinking and smoking, I would
certainly prevent all the degrading advertisements that disfigure
even reputable journals and newspapers and I would most decidedly
stop the obscene literature and portraits that soil the pages of some
of our magazines. But, alas, I have not the persuasive power I would
gladly possess. But to regulate these things by law, whether of the

Exception has been taken to my remarks at a meeting in Calcutta that
Deshbandhu, in his relations with the  Mussalmans, brought “the
science of surrender to perfection”. The exception has been taken
because my critics impute to me the implication that by surrender I
mean that Deshbandhu conferred on Mussalmans favours, that is, things
they were not entitled to. The critics opine that the Hindus are
acting towards the Mussalmans much the same as Englishmen are acting
towards us all—having first taken away everything and then offering
us doles in the name of favours.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I know what I said at the meeting in question. I have not read the
reports of my speech, but I desire to abide by all I said at that
meeting. I make bold to say that without mutual surrender there is no
hope for this distraught country. Let us not be hyper-sensitive or
devoid of imagination. To surrender is not to confer favour. Justice
that love gives is a surrender, justice that law gives is a
punishment. What a lover gives transcends justice. And yet it is
always less than he wished to give, because he is anxious to give
more and frets that he has nothing left. It is libellous to say that
Hindus act like Englishmen. Hindus cannot even if they would, and
this I say in spite of  the brutality of the labourers of Kidderpore.
Both Hindus and Mussalmans sail in the same boat. Both are fallen.
And they are in the position of lovers, have to be, whether they will
or no. Every act, therefore, of a Hindu towards the Mussalman and
<i>vice versa </i>must be an act of surrender and not mere justice.
They may not weigh their acts in golden scales and exact
consideration. Each has to regard himself ever a debtor of the other.
By justice, why should not a Mussalman kill a cow every day in front
of me? But his love for me restrains him from so doing and he goes
out of his way sometimes even to refrain from eating beef for his
love of me, and yet thinks that he has done only just what is right.
Justice permits me to shout my music in the ear of Maulana Mahomed
Ali when he is at prayer, but I go out of my way to anticipate his
feel-ings and make my talks whispers whilst he is praying and still
consider that I have conferred</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
no favour on the Maulana. On the other hand, I should become a
loathsome creature if I exercised my just right of playing tomtom
precisely at the time of his prayer. Justice might have been
satisfied if Deshbandhu Das had not filled certain posts with
Mussalmans, but he went out of his way to anticipate Mussalman wishes
and placate Mussalman sentiment. It was his sensitiveness to placate
them that hastened his death. For I know what a shock it was to him
to learn that law, i.e., justice, would compel him to disinter
certain remains buried in unauthorized ground and he was trying to
find out means of avoiding any the slightest offence to Muslim
sentiment, even though it may be unreasonable. This was all going out
of the way—not his way, but the way of the world. And yet he never
considered that he was conferring any favour on the Mussalmans by
delicately considering their feelings. Love never claims, it ever
gives. Love ever suffers, never resents, never revenges itself.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
This talk, therefore, of justice and nothing but justice is a
thoughtless, angry and ignorant outburst whether it comes from 
Hindus or Mussalmans. So long as Hindu and Mussalmans continue to
prate about justice, they will never come together. ‘Might is
right’ is the last word of ‘justice and nothing but justice.’.
Why should Englishmen surrender an inch of what they have earned by
right of conquest? Or why should Indians, when they come to power,
not  make the English disgorge everything which their ancestors
robbed them of? And yet when we come to a settlement, as we shall
some day, we will not weigh in the scales of justice so called. But
we shall introduce into the calculation the disturbing factor of
surrender, otherwise called love or affection or fellow-feeling. And
so will it be with us Hindus and Mussalmans when we have sufficiently
broken one another’s heads and spilled a few gallons of innocent
blood and realized our foolishness. The scales will then fall off our
eyes and we shall recognize that vengeance was not the law of
friendship; not justice but surrender and nothing but surrender was
the law of friendship. Hindus will have to learn to bear the sight of
cow-slaughter and the Mussalmans will have to discover that it was
against the law of Islam to kill a cow in order to wound the
susceptibilities of Hindus. When that happy day arrives, we shall
know only each other’s virtues. Our vices will not obtrude
themselves upon our gaze. That day may be far off or it may be very
near. I feel it coming soon. I shall work for that end and no other.</p>

surrender does not mean surrender of principle. I made the point
clear at the meeting and I wish to emphasize it here once more. But
what we are just now fighting for is not any principle at all, but

I would ask the reader to share my grief over the death of an
esteemed friend and silent servant—I mean Principal Sushil Rudra,
who died on Tuesday, 30th June. India, whose chief disease is her
political servitude, recognizes only those who are fighting publicly
to remove it by giving battle to a bureaucracy that has protected
itself with a treble line of entrenchment—army and navy, money and
diplomacy. She naturally does not know her selfless and self-effacing
workers in other walks of life, no less useful than the purely
political. Such a humble worker was Sushil Rudra, late principal of
St. Stephen’s College. He was a first-class educationist. As
principal, he had made himself universally popular. There was a kind
of spiritual bond between him and his pupils. Though he was a
Christian, he had room in his bosom for Hinduism and Islam which he
regarded with great veneration. His was not an exclusive Christianity
that condemned to perdition everyone who did not believe in Jesus
Christ as the only saviour of the world. Jealous of the reputation of
his own, he was tolerant towards the other faiths. He was a keen and
careful student of politics. Of his sympathies with the so-called
extremists, if he made no parade, he never made any secret either.
Ever since my return home in 1915, I had been his guest whenever I
had occasion to go to Delhi. It was plain sailing enough so long as I
had not declared satyagraha in respect of the Rowlatt Act. He had
many English friends in the higher circles. He belonged to a purely
English Mission. He was the first Indian principal chosen in his
college. I, therefore, felt that  his  intimate association with me
and his giving me shelter under his roof might compromise him and
expose his college to unnecessary risk. I, therefore, offered to seek
shelter elsewhere. His reply  was characteristic: “My religion is
deeper than people may  imagine.  Some of my opinions are vital parts
of my being. They are formed after deep and prolonged prayers. They
are known to my English friends. I cannot possibly be misunderstood
by keeping you under my roof as an honoured friend and guest. And if
ever I have to make</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="79. CHANCE OF PEACE"></a>
a choice between losing what influence I may have among  Englishmen
and losing you, I know what I would choose. You cannot leave me.”
“But what about all kinds of friends who come to see me? Surely,
you must not let your house become a caravanserai when I am in
Delhi,” I said. “To tell you the truth,” he replied, “I like
it all. I like the friends who come to see you. It gives me pleasure
to think that, in keeping you with me, I am doing some little service
to my country.” The reader may not be aware that my open letter<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
 the Viceroy, giving concrete shape to the Khilafat claim, was
conceived and drafted under Principal Rudra’s roof. He and Charlie
Andrews were my revisionists. Non-co-operation was conceived and
hatched under his hospitable roof. He was a silent but deeply
interested spectator at the private conference that took place
between the Maulanas, other Mussalman friends and myself. Religious
motive wasthe foundation for all his acts. There was, therefore, no
fear of temporal power, though the same motive also enabled him to
value the existence and the use and the friendship of temporal power.
He exemplified in his life the truth that religious perception gives
one a correct sense of proportion resulting in a beautiful harmony
between action and belief. Principal Rudra drew to himself as fine
characters as one could possibly wish for. Not many people know that
we owe C. F. Andrews to Principal Rudra. They were twins. Their
relationship was a study in ideal friendship. Principal Rudra leaves
behind him two sons and a daughter, all grown up and settled in life.
They know their grief is shared by the numerous friends and admirers
of their noble-hearted father.</p>

I do not read the Faridpur message as Mr. Chatterji does. Deshbandhu
made his position clear to the extent  that  he  was prepared to wait
for full responsible government till 1929, provided an honourable
compromise was offered by the Government    making it possible for
the people’s representatives to work the Reforms. What those terms

table conference. It was impossible for Deshbandhu to accept, in
advance and without accurately knowing them, the minority
recommendations of the Muddiman Committee. My own position is
incredibly simple. I am interested in the Reforms through  my
accredited agents, the Swarajists. They have specialized in the
matter and I shall endorse whatever they recommend. I have nothing to
offer the British Government save my weakness at the present moment.
In my weakness, I can only wait for England to make a sincere
gesture. When she does, I shall close unconditionally. Even in my
weakness, I feel strong enough to know what is and is not life-giving
and to reject what is not life-giving. I cannot deceive myself. I
expect nothing substantial till my poor country is strong. I must,
therefore, gather strength. And since I eschew violence from my
selection of means, I have to fall back upon the spinning-wheel and
such like or the more comprehensive term given by Deshbandhu—village
 reconstruction, and if and when necessary, civil disobedience.</p>

As to union of parties, I fear the differences between  the Liberals
and the Swarajists are in some respects fundamental. A mere
acceptance of Reforms under improved conditions does not necessarily
destroy the difference. If I may state the difference as it appears
to me, in one sentence, it is this : the Swarajists expect to be able
to retaliate within a measurable distance of time  if  the Government
do not accept the reasonable demands of the people, the Liberals
expect to secure what is possible merely by reasoning with the
Government. Liberals will, therefore, march with the Swarajists only
up to a certain point. But I may be, I hope I am, mistaken. Like
Barkis, I am ever willing.</p>

The correspondent’s position is historically accurate. It is
difficult to get out of the habit of using words which have passed
current with a definite meaning. Even “two communities” is open
to the same objection. I can only promise to be careful in future.
The watchful correspondent must not relax his effort to make the

I have almost promised the reader the sacred recollections of the
five days I had with Deshbandhu at Darjeeling. I have called them
among the most precious in my life. As time passes, the preciousness
increases. I must tell the reader why. Though I had lived under
Deshbandhu’s roof before, ours was then a purely political meeting.
We were both engrossed in our own allotted tasks. But in Darjeeling
it was different. I had Deshbandhu wholly to myself. He was resting
and I had gone solely to have communion with him. My going to
Darjeeling for rest was a mere excuse. But for Deshbandhu’s
presence</p>

there I would not have gone in spite of the attraction of the snowy
range. But in one of his pencil notes, which he had lately taken to
writing to me, he said, “Remember, you are under my jurisdiction. I
am Chairman of the Reception Committee. You have to include
Darjeeling in your tour. This is a command.” I wish I had kept
those sweet notes of his, but, alas! they have gone the way hundreds
of such documents in my possession have gone. I pleaded that I had
the Working Committee to take. “Then bring the whole Committee. I
shall arrange for their accommodation. The B.P.C.C. shall pay the
fares of the members. I am wiring to Satcouri accordingly,” was his
telegraphic reply. I was unable to take the Working Committee to
Darjeeling, but I promised to go as soon after that meeting as
possible. And so I went. I had gone there for only two days. He kept
me with him for five. He got Basanti Devi to ask</p>

He was on a convalescent if not on a sick-bed. He had need to be
taken care of. But he insisted on attending to every detail regarding
my comfort and that of my companions. His appointment must be on a
lavish scale. He had ordered five goats to be brought from the
plains. He would not have me miss my milk for a single meal. I had
often come under Basanti Devi’s sisterly care, but at Darjeeling I
was the object of Deshbandhu’s personal attention. Nor was there
any artificiality about it. Hospitality was the badge of his clan. He
related several striking anecdotes about their lavish hospitality. It
was at Darjeeling that I came to know his great regard for strangers 
or political opponents. At his instance, Satish Babu of Khadi
Pratishthan was sent for to discuss with him the plan we had settled
of working hand-spinning and khaddar in Bengal. I asked him where he
would like Satish Babu to stay. “Of course in this house,” he
said. “But we are over-crowded here,” I said. “Certainly not.
He can have my room for that matter,” was the retort. Whilst I was
thinking of him and his over-worked partner, he thought of Satish 
Babu’s  comfort. “Besides,” he said, “I know that Satish Babu
thinks I am prejudiced against him. He is a comparative stranger to
me. You know that I do not worry about my other friends. They cannot
misunderstand me. Satish Babu must stay in this house.”</p>

We talked of different political groups in Bengal and, incidentally,
I told him of the charges of bribery and corruption brought against
the Swaraj Party. I mentioned to him the fact that Sir Surendranath
had invited me to go to his house again before leaving Bengal. He
said, “Do go and tell him all about our conversations and my
emphatic denial of all charges of bribery and corruption. I am
prepared to retire from public life if one such charge against the
Party can be proved to be true. The fact is that Bengal political
life is one of mutual jealousy and back-biting. The phenomenal rise
and success of the Swaraj Party have become unbearable to some
people. I want you, therefore, thoroughly to go into all the char-ges
that may be brought against the Party and give your considered
judg-ment. I assure you I do not believe in dishonesty any more than
you do. I know that my country cannot be free by dishonest means. You

together or, at least, rid the air of mutual recrimination. You
should specially speak to Shyam Babu and Suresh Babu. Why do they not
come to me if they distrust or suspect anything? We may hold
different views, but we need not swear at each other.” “What
about a similar charge against  <i>Forward</i>? I do not know,
because I do not read these newspapers; but I have heard complaints
of that nature against <i>Forward </i>also”, I interposed. “Yes,
<i>Forward </i>may have been guilty. You know that I do not write for
or supervise <i>Forward </i>as you do in case of <i>Young India</i>.
But if people will bring such things to my notice, I will gladly
investigate and set matters right. You will, I think, find <i>Forward
</i>always on the defensive, but one may cross the boundary line even
in putting up a defence. As you know, I am investigating a serious
case of unpardonable exaggeration in <i>Forward </i>if the facts are
as they have been put before me. I assure you I have written most
strongly about it. I have even sent for the writer.” Thus the
conversation went on. I found, throughout it all, a scrupulous care
about justice to opponents and an honourable meeting of all parties.</p>

“What do you say to convening an All-Parties meeting, or, as Mr.
Kelkar suggests it, of the All-India Congress Committee?” I asked.
“I do not want it at present,” he replied. “The A.I.C.C. is
useless, because we Swarajists must play the game and give the
fullest trial to the new franchise. I tell you, I am more and more
coming round to your position about the charkha. I am afraid we have
not played the game everywhere. Here in Bengal, as you have said, you
had no opposition from any party. But had I not been laid up, I would</p>

have shown the charkha to be a swinging success. I tell you I
intended to work the charkha whole-heartedly and I wanted you to help
me in the organization; but, as you see, I have been helpless. No
revision can take place this year. On the contrary, we must all give
the  new franchise the fairest trial. I am going to write to the
Maharashtra friends about it.”</p>

Of the proposed All-Parties Conference he said, “We must not have
the conference just yet. I expect big things from Lord Birkenhead. He
is a strong man and I like strong men. He is not as bad as he speaks.
If we hold the meeting, we must say something on the situation. I do
not want to embarrass him by pitching our demands higher than he may
be prepared to grant at the present moment. I do not want to
disappoint him by understating our demands. We must watch and wait.
We can lose nothing by so doing. If his statement is not
satisfactory, that may be the time for calling a meeting of all
parties to decide upon a common course of action.” This was to me
novel reason for not convening the proposed meeting, so I said, “I
shall not call the meeting unless you and Motilalji want it or unless
I get a representative requisition. But I must confess to you that I
do not share your faith. Look at the Hindu-Muslim differences which
are widening. Contemplate the Brahmin and non-Brahmin quarrels. See
the political parties in Bengal. We have apparently never been so
weak as now. And don’t you agree with me that Englishmen have never
conceded anything to weakness? I feel that we must make ourselves
irresistible before we may expect anything big from England.”
Deshbandhu became impatient and said, ‘You are arguing like a
logician. I am speaking to you what I feel. Something within me tells
me we are in for something big.” I argued no more. I bowed my head
in reverence before a faith so robust. I told him I had great regard
for English character, I had inestimable friends among them, but I
saw that his faith in them was greater than mine. Let Englishmen know
what a great friend they have lost in Deshbandhu.</p>

The Pir question at Calcutta troubled him a great deal. He was
anxious that I should do what I could for its settlement. He said: “I
want to placate the Mussalman feeling. I had hoped that, after the
walling-in of the tomb, there would be nothing more heard about it.
But now that there is a strong agitation about the  disinterment,  I
cannot resist it. The law seems clearly against the burial on
unauthorized ground. Neither Subhash nor Suhrawardy had any authority
to grant the permission. But I must carry the Mussalmans</p>

Such was his passion for the wheel and therethrough of village
organization. “If Lord Birkenhead disappoints us,” he said, “I
do not know what we should do in the Councils. But this I know that
we must prosecute your programme of the charkha and organize our
villages. We must become an industrious nation once more. We must
bring power in the Councils. I must control the young men of Bengal.
I must demonstrate, with the aid of the Government if possible and
without if necessary, the possibility of achieving swaraj without
violence. Non-violence has become as much my final creed as yours for
the deli- verance of our country. We can have  no  civil disobedience
without non-violence. And without the ability to offer civil
resistance, there is no swaraj. We need not have to offer it in fact,
but we must have the ability. I must find work for my  impatient
young men. I agree with you that there is danger of corruption
creeping into our camp if we do not take care. I have learnt from my
guru the value of Truth in all our dealings. I want you to live with
him for a few days at least. Your need is not the same as mine. But
he has given me strength I did not possess before. I see things
clearly which I saw dimly before.</p>

But I dare not carry on this part of the conversation any further.  I
can only tell the reader that it developed into a spiritual
discussion or rather discourse, for it was all an endless stream on
his part of what he was then doing and what he proposed to do when he
was stronger. The discourse gave me an insight into his deeply
spiritual nature which I did not possess before. I did not know that
it was his ruling passion as it is that of so many distinguished
Bengalis. When he first talked, now four years ago, of building a hut
on the banks of the Ganges and repeated it at Sassoon Hospital when
he came to see me, I laughed within myself at the idea and jocosely
said that, when he built his hut, I must share it with him. But I
discovered my error at Darjeeling. He was more in earnest about it
than about his politics on which he had entered only by force of
circumstances.</p>

But if our main conversation always turned round the charkha, our
daily routine was not otherwise. The whole household had  become a
spinning club. Mahadev, Satish Babu and I had become expert teachers.
We all had our share of teaching Deshbandhu. He had begun his lessons
seriously at Patna. He had asked Rajendra Babu for a teacher. But he
was too ill then to make much progress. At  Darjeeling he had better
hope. His left shoulder was aching, but when the ache was gone, he
would do much better, he said. “But mind, I am very stupid with my
hands. Ask my wife how helpless I am.” “Yes,” said Basanti
Devi, “he calls me in even for unlocking his little box.” “You
women are too cunning for men. You keep your husband helpless even in
small matters, so as to have your complete mastery over him,”I
said. The whole house seemed to come down with the ringing of
Deshbandhu’s laughter. He had both the capacity for heartily
weeping and laughing. His weeping he did in secret, like his wife.
During this overwhelming grief, Basanti Devi has disdained to weep
even before his dearest ones. But Deshbandhu could laugh before
crowds of people and cover them with the sunshine of his laughter.
Our serious discussion started with laughter which the whole of that
big household heard. He knew that I liked sitting cross-legged. He
was reclining in his bedstead. I was in a chair. He could not bear
the sight of my sitting in the chair with my legs dangling
uncomfortably or attempting to cross them in the chair. So he had a
pillow put opposite him on his bedstead and a handspun rug arranged
on the bedding to make a gadi. He seated me on it. “Do you know,
what this reminds me of,” I said, as I sat comfortably on it just
face to face with him, “My memory goes back to over forty years
ago. It was thus my wife and I sat when we were married. The only
thing now lacking is the hand-clasp. I wonder what Basanti Devi has
to say to all this.” And the house rang with a laughter, alas!, no
more to be heard.</p>

The foregoing recollections were written at Bankura on the 8th
instant. Lord Birkenhead’s speech was published at Calcutta on the
9th and I glanced at it on the same day. I am writing this note on
the 10th. I have now carefully read the speech. It gives an added
value to the recol-lections. I know what a shock Lord Birkenhead’s
speech would have pro-ved to Deshbandhu. Somehow or other he had made
up his mind that Lord Birkenhead was going to do something big. In</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="83. LETTER TO MAHADEV DESAI"></a>
my humble opinion, the speech is a severe disappointment not so much
for what it does not give as for the utter inactualities for which
the Secretary of State for India has made himself responsible. Every
fundamental position that he takes up is challenged by almost every
educated Indian, no matter to what party he may belong. The pity of
it is that probably he believes all he says. Englishmen  have  an
amazing capacity for self-deception. It no doubt saves them many an
uncomfortable situation, but it does infinite harm to the world, a
large part of which they rule. They delude themselves into the belief
that they do so chiefly if not wholly for its benefit. I must
endeavour to examine this curious performance if possible next week.
Meanwhile, we owe a duty to the dead man who is one of the parties
responsible for making English politicians think about India more
than they did before. How would he have acted if he had been alive?
There is no cause for despair. There is less for anger. We had no
data  for expecting anything from Lord Birkenhead. What he has said
in praise of English rule in India is not new. A diligent sub-editor
has only to take up his scissors and paste to find out parallel
passages in almost identical words from his illustrious predecessors.
The speech  is  a notice to us to set our own house in order. I for
one am thankful for it. I have also Deshbandhu’s prescription
before me. I have shared it with the reader.</p>

Both the Punjab Government and the Sikhs are to be congratulated upon
the happy ending of the Akali movement. It has required the
self-immolation of hundreds of the bravest in the land. It has
required the imprisonment of thousands of brave Akalis. The public is
familiar with the tale of their sufferings in the jails. Such
marvellous sacrifice could not go in vain. Let us hope that  the
gurdwara reform will now proceed steadily and without a hitch. The
Government deserve the congratulations, too, on their release of
Akali prisoners and relaxation in the stringency of conditions
regarding the <i>Akhan</i><i>d</i><i> </i><i>Path</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>.
I note that the conditions imposed by the Government regarding the
release and the <i>Akhand </i><i>Path </i>have caused some
dissatisfaction. It is difficult to pronounce an opinion on them. At
the time of writing this note (11-7-25), I have only the meagre Press
telegram before me. But, if the conditions are not humiliating but
merely precautionary or designed to save the prestige of the
Government, I hope that the Akali friends will not raise unnecessary
objection. Their chief aim was to attain the reform of the gurdwaras.
This has been completely attained. The rest I regard as a matter of
subsidiary, if not trivial, importance. The Akalis will, therefore,
be well advised in not being strict in their interpretation of the
conditions the Government may have imposed upon the release of
prisoners and the performance of the <i>Akhand</i><i> </i><i>Path</i>.</p>

child-widows wherever I go. I have known countless women and,
therefore, can understand their suffering. I have made myself a
woman—am always trying to be ever more like one—in order to share
women’s suffering as best as a man can. I try to fill the place of
a mother to many a girl. Hence I fully understand the suffering of
this sister.</p>

I feel more and more strongly that there should be no such phenomenon
as a child-widow, a contradiction in terms. It is not in remaining a
widow, but in self-control that dharma consists. Compulsion and
self-control are mutually  exclusive  terms.  The former degrades a
human being, whereas the latter is uplifting. Remaining a widow under
compulsion is a sin, but doing so of one’s own free will is virtue,
lends beauty to the soul and acts as a shield for the purity of
society. To say that a girl of fifteen remains a widow voluntarily is
sheer impudence and ignorance. How can such a girl ever know the
misery of a widow’s life? It is the duty of her parents to give her
every facility to marry again. It is cowardice to submit to a cruel
custom, and manliness to defy it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have heard a great deal about the way in which marriages are
arranged  among  <i>Patidars</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

see no element of exaggeration in this sister’s letter.</p>

When I consider what advice I should give to widows who are young, I
realize my utter helplessness. It is easy to ask such a girl to marry
again. But whom should she marry. Who will find a husband for her ?
Should she marry outside her caste? Can a girl find a husband by
looking for one? Should she marry by advertising for a husband? Is
marriage a business arrangement? Where social opinion is hostile or
indifferent to her, it is almost impossible for a child- widow to
find a husband. And how can I advise a girl to bind herself to any
kind of fellow if she fails to find a suitable partner?</p>

I can, therefore, only appeal to the guardians of childwidows. But I
doubt if <i>Navajivan </i>is ever likely to find its way into their
hands. Persons of their class generally do not read newspapers. This
is the difficulty in which I find myself. But I can give this advice
to child- widows. They should suffer in patience. They may pour out
their suffering before their elders, men or women, and tell them
everything they want. If the elders do not understand their feelings
or do not</p>

like Damayanti, Savitri<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>and
Parvati<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>in the
past,  do  <i>tapascharya </i>appropriate and possible in this age.
That <i>tapascharya </i>is study. For a widow, there is nothing
better than intellectual and spiritual studies and physical activity
to steady the mind. They can do physical <i>tapascharya </i>by
devoting every moment of their time to the spinning- wheel,
intellectual <i>tapascharya </i>by devoting themselves to literary
studies and spiritual <i>tapascharya </i>by purifying themselves
inwardly, by striving to realize the <i>atman</i>. The elders cannot
come in their way in any of these pursuits; and, even if they try,
they cannot succeed. Everyone has a right to do these three things.
If a widow is denied this right, she should certainly resort to
satyagraha.</p>

The elders of such widows will have reason for regret afterwards if

I am never without such advisers. Since in answering their questions
from time to time, I can also explain the aim of <i>Navajivan</i>, a
discussion of the subject is not without purpose. It is not true to
say that <i>Navajivan </i>discusses only the spinning-wheel, but it
may be said that the spinning-wheel gets the first importance.
However, I can see from the subscribers that still remain that they
do not mind exclusive attention to the spinning-wheel.</p>

<i>Navajivan </i>is not run for making money, nor is it intended for
promoting any and every kind of activity : it is only a medium for
the propagation of my ideas. <i>Navajivan </i>will not continue
publication with the help of loans, or seek to meet its expenses by
accepting advertisements. Nor will it be brought out and offered free
to readers, with the help of donations from a few friends. Its
readers should regard themselves as its proprietors. <i>Navajivan </i>is
my weekly letter to them. They will spend money on it, subscribe to
it and keep it alive so long as the ideas presented through it appeal
to them, for every week  I pour out my soul in it and I know that
nothing but good can result from studying a thing which expresses the
very heart of its author, even though he may be an illiterate person.</p>

<i>Navajivan </i>is an organ for telling the people about the
invaluable method of satyagraha. If I may say so, I live only to
teach its use. The idea is not new. I am convinced that I am only
putting before the people an old thing in a somewhat new language and
a new garb. I believe that we can secure swaraj only through
satyagraha. Swaraj is our life-breath and, deprived of it, we are in
the condition of a man choking without air. I am quite clear in my
mind that, if I succeed in explaining to the people the basic
principles of satyagraha, an easy path will have been discovered,
which the country and the world can follow. It is possible, of
course, that I may die before I have succeeded in leading the people
to this royal road.</p>

This path of satyagraha cannot be followed except with the help of
the spinning-wheel. God, for the hungry, is food. This is why the
Upanishads, even describe food as <i>Brahman</i>. Food is produced by

labour of man’s body. Since we do not work enough with our bodies,
we get less food. People remain unemployed during four months in a
year. The net result of this has been that the nation has lost its
vitality. The spinning-wheel is an unrivalled means of restoring
strength to it and ending its hunger. One drop of rain is of no
consequence, but an infinite number of them have such power of
nourishing that they give new life to the whole world every year. In
the same way, it may be that one spinning-wheel will seem to achieve
nothing, but a multitude of them have as much power, at least, as a
mass of rain drops. In one sense, it has more. One drop of water by
itself will be wasted; a mass of them out of season may do harm. But
even one spinning-wheel will bring some gain to the person who works
on it. There is no time of the year when the spinning-wheel will be
out of season. That is why “Here no effort undertaken is lost, no
disaster befalls. Even a little of this righteous course delivers one
from great fear.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

It is, moreover, a lesson in peace, and a potent means of self-
purification. There are other means, too, of self-purification which
<i>Navajivan </i>discusses, and will continue to discuss, from time
to time. All articles, in the final analysis, are concerned with one
idea, namely, self-purification, swaraj, satyagraha. <i>Navajivan’s
</i>aim is to increase our inner strength and help us to win swaraj
through it. If, therefore, it discusses subjects like Council-entry,
it is only with the aim of promoting self-purification, of developing
spiritual strength. <i>Navajivan </i>can give nothing exciting just
now, for there is no gain in doing so. Time spent in criticizing
others is merely wasted. Criticism has some meaning only when it is
backed by strength. Those who understand this point will appreciate
the policy followed in <i>Navajivan </i>and will not stop reading it.
The paper will continue as long as it has a fair number of
subscribers. When the number falls below a certain limit, I will not
lose a moment, nor shall I feel one pang of heart, in stopping its
publication.</p>

Another reader has made a different suggestion, which also I shall
discuss here. He says that people find the price of five pice much
too high. If the price is kept at one pice, he says, there will be a
large number of subscribers and <i>Navajivan </i>will not have to
draw from its own resources. Those who understand something about
accounts will see that, if a thing is priced below a certain level,
the larger its sale the greater will be the loss. That is, increase
in sales will be a gain only if the thing is sold at profit. If a
paper is published at a loss, as the sales increase the loss will
increase. At first <i>Navajivan </i>used to be published at a loss.
After due calculations, the subscription has been fixed at a suitable
rate. It certainly yields some profit, which increases when the sales
increase. If anyone feels inclined to suggest that the price should
be fixed so as to eliminate this profit, he should know that the
profit is not large enough for its elimination to make a difference
to the rate of subscription.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

<i>Young </i><i>India </i>does not now run at a loss. <i>Hindi
Navajivan </i>may still be said to be in that position. Its sales
have not become so regular that it can be considered to be
self-supporting. They still rise and fall. But the loss on its
account is also not being borne exclusively by the subscribers of
<i>Navajivan</i>. It is borne by the institution as a whole, i.e., by
all its departments jointly. Friends could have borne the loss, but,
knowing that this family was not likely to give up its pledge to
accept no help from outside, they did not press the offer.</p>

Readers of <i>Navajivan </i>know how deeply I have been impressed by
the work of the Bengal Khadi Pratishthan. After reading my report,
Shri Lakshmidas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>sent Shri Mathuradas to inspect its work; the latter has
written down the conclusions which he has  arrived  at  after
personal inquiry and given me a copy of the report. However careful
my examination might have been, it could not be treated as
scientific. Shri Mathuradas’s inquiry, on the other hand, was
scientific, for he has specialized in this field, has conducted
careful inquiries into the working of other such establishments and
is so well informed about the finances of some of them that he can
reel off precise figures. I, therefore, attach greater value to his
inquiry than to mine. In my report the reader would find my
conclusions, but, little of the evidence on which they are based,
whereas in the report  of  this  scientific inquiry he would get the
evidence as well. Shri Mathuradas’s inquiry being of this
character, its results are given elsewhere in this issue.</p>

work from its employees like any business establishment and pays them
adequately. But, even then, it has on its staff men who work in a
spirit of self-sacrifice, and the reason is that the two chief
workers, Acharya Ray and his right-hand man, Satish Babu, are men of
this type. Another reason is that, though the methods of work
followed are those of a business establishment, selfish motives find
no place in it.</p>

I told the merchants in Jalpaiguri<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>that this was the key to the country’s freedom. Our
merchants helped in the enslavement of India for the sake of their
trade, and so the country will come into its own again only when this
class learns to think less of self-interest and more of public
interest. It is not enough that they should contribute crores. They
are doing that. We shall reach our goal when they dedicate their
intelli-gence to the service of the country. A merchant who has done
this will not think of amassing wealth for himself; he will earn it
for the country. He will not, moreover, consider which business will
earn most for the country; he will rather think which trade will help
the largest number among the masses to earn most by working in their
own villages. We have got a few business men of this type, and that
is why we are making the progress we see today. Anyone of us can
measure this progress by making an elementary calculation. I praise
Satish Babu’s work because, though he has sacrificed his business
worth millions and dedicated his intelligence, the services of the
members of his family and his resources to the propagation of khadi,
he is not in the least conscious of his self-sacrifice, or rather he
has no trace of pride for having done all this. This is because he
has found joy in self-sacrifice. It would be impossible for him to
live without it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The reader need not conclude from my eulogy that, from a business
point of view, Satish Babu’s work is above criticism. If there is
anything in it deserving of criticism, it is due to no fault of his.
He lacks, to that extent, knowledge of business matters. This
ignorance will disappear with experience. Let us hope that many more
such business men of intelligence will sacrifice their all and come
forward to do business in khadi not with an eye to profit but for the
sake of the country.</p>

relating to the disposal of the yarn received by it in virtue of the
resolution on the subject passed last year by the All-India Congress
Committee.</p>

These facts teach us some important lessons. An organi- zation is
like a machine. If in a machine one screw becomes loose, it slows
down or, sometimes, even breaks down; the same thing happens to
organizations, especially organizations doing constructive work. If
attention is not paid even to the minutest details of their working,
production will fall. Weak yarn, carelessly wound bundles of yarn,
bundles of yarn not stored properly—any such negligence will bring
down the quality of khadi, raise the cost of weav- ing and reduce its
speed. We observe, too, that the slow progress in work was wholly due
to negligence at the spinning stage.</p>

The khadi produced has been priced at market rates, for the quantity
available was so little that there was no meaning in selling it at
reduced price. It would also have been a problem, if the khadi were
offered at reduced price, to decide who had the prior right to buy
it. That such a problem should not arise over a small stock of khadi
was one reason for my advice that it should be sold at market rates.</p>

I have not worried the readers of <i>Young India </i>with an account
of the Kidderpore Hindu-Muslim riot on the <i>Bakr-Id </i>day,
although I happened to be on the scene of the riot only a few hours
after it had taken place. I did, however, give a long interview<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>to   the Associated Press almost after my return to
Russa Road from Kidderpore. In the interview, I gave it as my
deliberate opinion that the Hindu labourers were wholly in the wrong.
This statement has enraged some of my Hindu correspondents who have
favoured me with most abusive and offensive letters protesting
against my having found fault with the Hindus. One of them would have
me adopt a Muslim name. I take notice of this correspondence in order
to show to what pass some of us have come in our blind zeal for our
respective faiths. We refuse to see anything wrong in ourselves. When
such becomes the normal state of a majority of people belonging to a
particular faith, that faith is dying. For nothing based on a lie can
persist for any length of time.</p>

I venture to suggest that I have rendered a service to Hinduism by
exposing without any reservation the wrong done by the Hindu
labourers in question. They, the labourers themselves, did not resent
my plain speaking. On the contrary, they seemed to be grateful for
it. They felt penitent, admitted the wrong done and sincerely
apologized for it.</p>

forfeited the right to call myself a Hindu, been unworthy of holding

One correspondent says when Hindus sought help in Delhi, I pleaded
helplessness, when my presence is sought in Lucknow I evade it, but
when it is a matter of condemning Hindus, I hasten to the scene of
action and thoughtlessly judge them. Let it be known that I went to
Kidderpore on the strength of an invitation received from a Hindu on
behalf of the Hindus and upon a call from Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta who had
preceded me. In spite of my helplessness, if I heard of an actual
fight and especially if I found that I was wanted by either party, I
should hasten to the rescue. It is when one party only calls me to
adjust a quarrel or prevent it, I should plead helplessness because
of loss of influence among a certain class of Hindus and Mussalmans.
The difference between the two positions is too obvious to need
pointing out.</p>

But it is urged by the correspondents, as it was urged by a
deputation that waited on me, that by my severe condemnation of the
Hindus, I had encouraged the Mussalmans to commit assaults on
innocent men and exposed the Bazar Hindu shopkeepers to looting and
worse by Mussalman <i>goondas.  </i>I should feel sorry if my
condemnation of a Hindu misdeed should give rise to a Mussalman
misdeed. But I could even then be not deterred from doing the right
thing. And why should Hindus be afraid of Mussalman reprisals? Surely
it would be right for Hindus, if they cannot follow my method of
non-violence and resignation—and I admit that it is most difficult
for propertied men to do so—to defend themselves by every means at
their disposal. To be men we must shed cowardice, whether we are
Hindus or Mussalmans, and learn the art of self-defence. No amount of
hide and seek can avert the certain danger that awaits those who will
not learn to defend themselves, although they would like to be
defended by others. My condemnation of Hindus of Kidderpore does not
carry with it condemnation of those who defend themselves when
attacked. Had the Hindus instead of being the aggressors been found
defending themselves against heavy odds and had died in the attempt, 
I would have praised their valour. But at Kidderpore, so far as I
know</p>

they were in an overwhelming majority, they were the aggressors. The
Mussalmans had given them no cause for quarrel. I wouldunhesitatingly
condemn unprovoked violence as I had no difficulty about condemning
the Mussalman misdeeds in Kohat and Gulbarga which I thought were
utterly uncalled for. I can even understand two blows against one,
but I cannot reconcile myself to any blow without the slightest
provocation or provocation worked up for the occasion.</p>

Exception has been taken to my defence at a Memorial meeting of the
memory of Deshbandhu against the charge of Tammany Hall meth-ods. It
has been taken on the ground that such a reference at a Memorial
meeting was a jarring note. I believe that I have the sense of the
delicate. I knew what I was doing. I was presenting Deshbandhu’s
life to the students of Calcutta. I had in my mind audible whispers
about Tammany Hall methods alleged to have been adopted by
Deshbandhu. And as I had a most vivid recollection of  my
conversation with him on the matter, I felt that I would have been
false to the sacred memory of a comrade if I had not assured the
students of the baselessness of the charge. After all, we will not
make the memory of our distinguished countrymen sacred by covering
their blemishes. It should be permissible to cherish the memory of
our heroes at the same time that we acknowledge their proved
blemishes. False delicacy is no delicacy. If Deshbandhu was guilty of
Tammany Hall methods, let us own the fact and, whilst treasuring all
that was noblest in him, let us beware of his particular methods. But
believing as I did that he was not guilty of those methods, I could
not conceive a happier occasion than the one I had at the University
Institute.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

But what are Tammany Hall methods? If I know them correctly, it is a
name given to the machinations secret and open resorted to by a class
of men in America for seizing for their selfish end corporations and
offices in which they do not hesitate to make use of fraud, bribery
and every form of public corruption. I had the most emphatic

Darjeeling, from Deshbandhu himself, with the invitation to
investigate such char-ges and publicly denounce every proved charge
of bribery or corruption. The first indispensable test of Tammany
Hall is obviously lacking. Neither Deshbandhu nor his lieutenants to
his knowledge had any selfish ends to serve. Indeed, such people
could not long remain with him. So if any one bribed anybody else, it
was for an unselfish end. But, personally, I draw no distinction
between the two forms of bribery. Nor did Deshbandhu draw any. He
said to me emphatically that he could not, even if he would, free his
country by corrupt methods, if only because the  Government  had 
reduced bribery or corruption to a perfect science. The truth is that
for the first time, within the experience of the present generation
we have a well- drilled, disciplined and compact political party
functioning in the Councils and the Assembly. It, therefore, seems
unthinkable to some that such a party could be kept together without
bribery and corruption. The Government has done their best to
discredit the party by all the means at its command. Rival political
parties have lent a ready ear to every rumour or talk about bribery.
There is no doubt that some people honestly believe that bribery was
one of the means resorted to by Deshbandhu for keeping the  Party 
together  and gaining other support at crucial moments in the
Council.</p>

So far as I know, there is no foundation for the charge. The memory
of Deshbandhu will not suffer by anyone who can clearly establish the
charges of his having done so. It is better that the public know
definitely what is said in inaudible tones. After all, the charge was
not merely against the Deshbandhu, rather it was</p>

more among us, the Party survives. And if I know it, I know that it
is capable of standing the searchlight of investigation if anyone had
proof of corruption against it.</p>

loss I decided to stand by Bengal in the hour of her greatest need
and, so far as was possible, to wipe her tears and to comfort Basanti
Devi as also the fatherless children, I had also decided not to force
myself on any of them, but humbly to hold myself at their disposal.
It was a simple duty I owed to the memory of a departed friend and
comrade. The inauguration of an All-Bengal Deshbandhu Memorial Fund
for which I was chiefly responsible made my stay in Bengal
peremptory. Events have justified the wisdom of my decision.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But I had little expected that I should have to give any advice or
guidance in the selection of the Mayor of Calcutta in the place of
Deshbandhu. It was a task I would gladly have avoided. But for a
soldier there is often no choice. The matter was referred to me by
parties interested in the selection. and I could not shirk the
responsibility, as I could not conscientiously plead incapacity.
Having been drawn into the vortex, there was no escape from it till
the matter was formally decided by the Congress Municipal Party.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Whether the advice I tendered was sound or not, whether it was in the
interest of the city or not is undoubtedly a matter which is capable
of many opinions. I can only say that I gave the advice that, in my
opinion, was the best for the country and for the City  of Palaces. I
had before me a tradition and a policy as my measure. My duty lay in
doing that which, in my opinion, Deshbandhu would have done if he was
with us in the flesh, in so far as it was in no way in conflict with
known and recognized ethical principles. The Congress has for the
past four years decided to capture municipalities and local boards in
its own interest and for the furtherance of its constructive
programme. The idea behind the capture was not better care of
sanitation, but acquisition of greater political power. There  was 
nothing wrong in this ambition. The Government itself has used these
institutions of its creation more for the consolidation of its power
and enhancement of its prestige than for better sanitation. I have
known London county council elections fought on political issues. And
when political fever has run high, a municipal election has been used
as an index for gauging the political barometer. And if it has been
considered necessary to use municipalities in England for political
purposes, much more is it so in a country where a whole nation lies
under the political domination of another. Once grant the
advisability of utilizing the machinery created by the Government,
the capture of municipal institutions for gaining political power is
an inevitable step. Deshbandhu captured the Corporation of Calcutta
to that end and he</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
used it most effectively for the consolidation of the power of the
Congress or, which is almost the same thing in Bengal, the Swaraj
Party. Did he thereby neglect the interest of the corporation? I
venture to say emphatically no. On the contrary, his municipal
ambition was as high as the political.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Who was then to be the Mayor in his place? It was a gift within the
power of the party of his creation. It must be bestowed upon him who
could best carry out the tradition bequeathed by the great chief and
who could gain additional prestige for the Party, it being 
understood that he was also, in the Party, the best person considered
from the purely Municipal standpoint. In my opinion, Mr. J. M. Sen
Gupta was the fittest person answering these requirements. And if he
was good enough to lead the Swaraj Party, he deserved all the
adventitious support that could be given to him in order to enable
him to wear Deshbandhu’s mantle with grace and dignity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But could he do justice to the triple burden? He was already elected
President of the Provincial Congress Committee. Could he lead the
Swaraj Party, and, at the same time, carry out the constructive
programme of the Congress and discharge the heavy responsibility of
the Mayoralty of Calcutta? What was the use of the triple honour if
the burden was to break him? My answer was that Mr. Sen Gupta alone
was the best judge of his own capacity. The power should be given him
if he needed and wanted it. It should not be thrust upon him. It was,
undoubtedly, a dangerous experiment if Mr. Sen Gupta was a schemer,
putting his own interest before the country’s. In that case, it was
dangerous even to make him leader of the Swaraj Party. If he was
above suspicion, he should have the Mayoralty if he needed it for his
work and if he could creditably discharge the burden. No Congressman
worthy of the name, much less the successor of Deshbandhu, could dare
seek honour for honour’s sake. For me, Mr. Sen Gupta occupied the
position of MacSwiney, who wanted to become the Lord Mayor of Cork,
not so that he might gain any honour for himself, but so that he
might face the danger that was then in store for him who occupied the
exalted position. The position of the successor of Deshbandhu is, if
possible, fraught with  greater danger than MacSwiney had to face.
MacSwiney put his life at stake. Deshbandhu’s successor had to put
his whole reputation at stake. The slightest deviation from the
standard of sacrifice and honour bequeathed by Deshbandhu might blast
his successor’s reputation for life,—a living death worse than
the death of the mere body. Thus I</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
reasoned to myself and my friends in pressing Mr. Sen Gupta’s claim
to the Mayoralty of Calcutta. And I am thankful to be able to record
that both the Congress Party and the Congress Municipal Party
understood and appreciated my argument and, with but few
dissentients, accepted the nomination of Mr. Sen Gupta. I only hope
that they will make his burden as light as it is possible for them to
make. I have no doubt in my mind that Mr. Sen Gupta will try to live
up to the high standard set by Deshbandhu.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
But let no one regard this as a precedent for all time. On pure
principle it is wrong to combine three important functions in one
person, no matter how able he may be. No man can do full justice to
three heavy tasks. The temptation, too, for self-aggrandizement for
any man is too great. It is unfair to expose anyone to avoidable
temptation. Moreover, even though political parties may capture
municipal bodies, it would be wrong to give municipal
responsibilities to active politicians. We must, even in our bondage,
treat municipal matters on their own merits and create municipal
specialists  who would refuse to be guided by political
considerations in the discharge of their municipal duties. If we do
not take all these precautions, our experiment of capturing municipal
bodies is foredoomed to failure. Municipal life requires a training
which a busy politician is not always fitted for. A municipal
councillor, therefore, best serves his political party by divesting
himself of the politician whilst he is occupying the municipal chair,
even as a judge, on assuming office, ceases to be an advocate or a
politician. The reason why, in spite of my love of municipal life and
my knowledge of its utmost importance, I have permitted myself to
advise the dangerous combination of three functions in one person is
because I conceive the present to be an extraordinary occasion
requiring a drastic, nay, a dangerous step. Dases are not born every
day. Deshbandhu has left a gap which it is impossible for any man to
fill. He who has to shoulder the burden left by him needs, therefore,
extraordinary props. And on the assumption of average ability and
honesty, he should have them. But, so far as I am concerned, this
experiment, I hope, is the first and the last in my life. I have
countenanced it with a full sense of my responsibility and the danger
attendant upon it. May God grant the necessary wisdom and the power
to Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta. Let the citizens of Calcutta rest assured
that the election of an active politician is not intended to be a
menace to the healthy growth of the municipal life of Calcutta. We
have precedents for it in the brilliant example of Pherozeshah Mehta</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always"><a name="97. NOTES"></a>
than whom we never had a better President of a corporation or a
better councillor. His tradition was kept up last year by Vithalbhai
Patel, who, even his opponents admitted, discharged the burden of his
high office with great ability and equally great impartiality. And
Vithalbhai Patel is nothing if he is not a fiercely active
politician. In stating my position, I have really dealt with the
highest form of municipal life. That type has yet to be evolved by us
in India. And I am hoping that it would be the privilege of the
Congress to do so. It will not be till we have men whose ambition
will be more than fully satisfied if they can keep the gutters and
closets of their cities scrupulously clean and supply the purest milk
at the cheapest rates and rid them of drunknness and prostitution.</p>

The tour that I am now making in Bengal has been turned into a
Memorial tour. I was disinclined to tear myself away from Calcutta at
the present moment and whilst the ten lacs are uncollected. But I had
not the heart to disappoint the people of the respective Districts
which  I was under promise to visit. But I had warned the people that
my tour this time would be for collecting the Deshbandhu Memorial
Fund and deliver-ing his message. And even from the Memorial
standpoint, I am glad I am touring. The response of the Poor people,
both men and women, has been marvellous everywhere. They have needed
no coaxing. They have given to the fullest measure for the asking. It
has been a common experience to find old widows undoing the little
knots of the corners of their saris and giving up all they had in
them. Often have I felt like returning such donations. But, on second
thoughts, I have not only reconciled myself to them, but felt it to
be a pleasing duty to receive them. Had not Deshbandhu given his all?
And was not the hospital to be for women in distress? Were not some
poor widows destined to receive training as nurses at the institution
that will soon be founded? Why should I doubt the law of God which
says that He rewards tenfold those who give their all for a good
cause? Nor have the well-to-do been unwill-ing to pay. I was not
prepared for ornaments at women’s meetings in the <i>mofussil</i>.
But in no place have the good sisters failed to give their
orna-ments. At Serajgunj two of them gave away their heavy gold
chains. It is remarkable too that, in</p>

all the four places I have visited at the time of writing these
notes, the collections at the women’s meetings, though naturally
attended by hundreds against men’s thousands, have been as much  as
 at  the men’s.</p>

These collections have been a study in more ways than one. They have
been an ocular demonstration of the poverty of the masses.  I am
collecting from thousands of them. At every meeting coppers have
abounded. In many cases, they have given even half pices. Not because
the people have been unwilling to give more, but because to my
knowledge they had no other coins. They undid their knots or emptied
their pockets in my presence.</p>

From Serajgunj to Ishurdi we have been travelling in a slow train. It
is a branch service. There are stations every ten minutes. Villagers
have attended the stations in their hundreds and, at several places,
in their thousands and have paid their pice. The whole of this great
demonstration has been arranged by the silent, selfless youth of
Bengal. Their names will never be noted in the newspapers. They
probably do not even want themselves to be advertised. Their sterling
work is their advertisement. Without them the villagers would have
known noth- ing. They, the young men, are their walking newspapers.
For they neither read nor write. And those few that do are too poor
to buy news-papers. All honour to these brave, sacrificing servants
of India. Every one of the meetings at these stations has been most
orderly, noiseless, solemn and business-like. Swaraj  will  certainly
come through these young lovers of their country. Nor must I omit to
mention the railway officials. The railway authorities from the
highest to the lowest have been exceptionally courteous and attentive
throughout my previous tour, but I am undoubtedly more in need of
their help now than before. The task of collection from thousands at
wayside stations within a few minutes is no light task. And yet it
has been achieved because they too conspired with the people and the
volunteers to make my task as light as possible. Be it noted that I
had to alight at all the stations and pass through crowds, make the 
collection and return to my compartment in time. Deshbandhu dead is 
a more powerful force for drawing the best out of men than he was
when he was alive. His countrymen realize the debt they owe him and,
therefore, to their country.</p>

Doubts have been raised as to whether the proposed hospital is to be
opened in the very mansion that has belonged to his family for two
generations. I thought that the matter was absolutely clear in the
appeal signed by Lord Sinha and others. That mansion is already in
the hands of the trustees for such purposes as a hospital and the
like. Its value is over three lacs. It is burdened with a debt of
over two lacs. The debt will be paid naturally out of the collections
being now made. But the trustees of the Memorial will then acquire a
property worth three lacs for two lacs. In other words, the trustees
will have eleven lacs of capital when they have finished their
collection of ten lacs.</p>

There are still people who ask me whether I am really serious and
sanguine about collecting 10 lacs. All I can say is that I do not
know Bengal at all if it does not give 10 lacs for this Memorial
towards which I have not yet met a single person who has refused to
give something. The question of collecting the amount is merely a
question of time and organization. I do not entertain the slightest
doubt about the success of the collection.</p>

I have answered locally the charge that the object of the Memorial is
not inspiring. The sceptics imply thereby that the object should have
been political. But let me remind them  that  the signatories to the
appeal had no choice. Those who want to revere Deshbandhu’s memory
cannot do so if they do not respect his own wishes. I hold that his
wishes must be a first charge upon any collection that may be made by
us, the survivors, to perpetuate his memory. Deshbandhu knew what he
was doing when he made over his property to a trust. He deliberately
chose to give it for a charitable, not a political, purpose. The
survivors are not only, therefore, bound to acquire the house for the
nation, but also to use it for the purpose intended by the donor.
Bengal is, therefore, in my opinion, in honour bound to use the
mansion as a hospital for women and an institution for training
nurses. I hear that in some places Bengalis are collecting funds for
local memorials. I hope that every city will have a memorial worthy
of the great patriot. But that time is not yet. In my humble opinion,
the honour of every Bengali who cherishes Deshbandhu’s memory is
pledged to finish the collection of 10 lacs for the All- Bengal
Memorial before diverting a single pice for a local memorial.</p>

The Bengalis outside Bengal, beware. They have not all yet made their
returns. If all the Bengalis who have known Deshbandhu will not exert
themselves, the collection is likely to be unduly prolonged. I hope,
therefore, that those Bengalis who read these notes will exert
themselves to the utmost within their own circles to secure the best
subscriptions.</p>

I have lately been calling on a number of rich people to collect
donations for the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund. One of them was Shri
Sadhuram Tularam. There I not only secured a generous donation, but
also had occasion to talk to those present about religious matters.
Untouchability was mentioned and it was said that something had
appeared in the newspapers attributing to me the view that we should
interdine and intermarry with the socalled untouchables. What I said
to disabuse them regarding this only seemed to surprise those who had
raised the point, and they suggested that I might publish a  summary
of what I told them in the <i>Hindi Navajivan</i>. I have accepted
the suggestion and give here the required summary.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I must make it clear to the people, in the first place, that I do not
as a rule read newspapers and on the rare occasions when I do, I find
 it impossible to repudiate all the false things that are attributed
to me. If, therefore, anyone at any time has a doubt, he should ask
me what I had said on any given occasion. Now, if someone has said in
the newspapers that I stand for or encourage interdining  and
intermarrying with our untouchable brethren, he has made a mistake. I
have stated categorically a thousand times that abolition of
untouchability does not mean the abolition of the social restraints
governing eating and marrying. With whom shall one eat or marry is an
entirely different question and I do not find it necessary at the
moment to pronounce upon it. I believe on the contrary that our
mixing the two questions may impede the reform we wish to bring
about. It is the duty of everyone who considers himself a Hindu to
work for the eradication of untouchability. By mixing it up with
other issues we shall be harming our cause.</p>

also accept water at the hands of an untouchable. I recognize only
four <i>varnas</i>. There is to me no fifth <i>varna </i>called the
untouchables. We must, therefore, eradicate untouchability, and the
sufferings of the Hindus considered untouchable, and purify Hinduism
as well as ourselves. In other words, there is no room for hatred and
contempt in religion. Hatred is implicit in untouchability. We must
do away with this hatred. Hinduism is a religion which holds service
to be of the highest importance. Why should those considered
untouchable be denied service?</p>

	Your <i>sadhana </i>is the development of the place where you are

	Even if it proves untrue in the end, neither we nor the world will

Surely this is a long introduction to what I want to say. Here is
Pitt’s letter and the letters from Kelappan. I am simply saying
that we must keep nominally a satyagrahi at the Eastern gate unless
the local men think otherwise. But you may come to other conclusion.
You should write to Kelappan. He seems to be a nice, useful man.</p>

</font></sup>.  In  view  of your letter, I am just now writing

	point of prohibition is necessary as a matter of principle and
	discipline. In my opinion, an unequivocal declaration by the State
	is necessary. The condition of the untouchables should not be
	precarious. But, as before, I shall do nothing in a hurry and shall
	correspond with you before taking any step forward. I hope, however,
	that the prohibition that still exists in reality will be removed
	very soon and without the necessity of direct action. What about the

harshness of it is unintended. The Secretary of State could not help
himself. He has spoken as he has felt or rather been coached to feel.
But his promises are only apparently alluring. A closer perusal
leaves one under the impression that the maker of them knows that he
will never be called upon to fulfil them. Let us take the most
tempting of them. It says, in effect, ‘produce your constitution
and we  will consider it.’ Is it not our thirty-five years’
experience that we have made petitions that we have considered to be
perfect, but that they have been rejected “after careful
consideration”? Having had that experience, we dropped the beggar’s
bowl in 1920 and made up our minds to live by our own exertion, even
though we should perish in the attempt. It is not draughtsmanship
that his Lordship really asks, it is swordsmanship he invites, with
the full knowledge that the invitation will not be and could not be
accepted. The evidence is in the speech itself. He had before him the
Minority report of the Muddiman Committee, i.e., of Dr. Sapru and Mr.
Jinnah, two among the cleverest lawyers we have in India and who have
never been guilty of the crime of non-co-operation, and one of whom
has been Law Member of the Viceregal Council. They and their
colleague have been told that they did not know their business. Has
then a constitution framed by Pandit Motilal Nehru and endorsed by,
say, the Right Honourable Srinivasa Sastri   and   Mian   Fazli  
Hussain<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1      </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>a   better   chance   of   favourable reception? Is not
Lord Birkenhead’s offer a trap for the unwary to fall in? Supposing
an honest constitution is drawn up just to meet the present
situation, will it not be immediately regarded as preposterous and
something infinitely less offered in its stead? When I was hardly
twenty-five years old, I was taught to believe that, if we wished to
be satisfied with 4 annas, we must ask for 16 annas in order to get
the 4 annas. I never learnt that lesson because I believed in asking
for just what I needed and fighting for it. But I have not failed to
observe that there was a great deal of truth in the very practical
advice.</p>

with it, but because they know that nothing but the waste-paper
basket is its destiny. It has not been signed because those who have
refrained do not wish to be party to the insult of the nation which
its summary rejection will imply. Let Lord Birkenhead say that he
will accept any reasonable constitution that may be prepared by a
party or parties overwhelmingly representative of Indian public
opinion and he will have a constitution in a week’s time. Let him
publicly assure Dr. Besant that her Bill will have every chance of
acceptance if it is endorsed by Pandit Motilal Nehru and others whom
he may name, and I shall undertake to secure those signatures. The

It is no fault of the Secretary of State for India that his offer
does not read sincere. We are not ready as yet to demand anything.
Therefore, naturally, it is for the British Government to give and
for us to reject, if what is offered is not deemed enough for the
time being. For us that the new Commander-in-Chief considers as
unattainable is the only thing worth living for, fighting for and
dying for. One’s birthright is never unattainable and Lokamanya
taught us that swaraj was our birthright. The definition of that
swaraj is to rule ourselves, although we misrule ourselves for the
time being. We, the English and the Indians, are in a hopeless
muddle. Lord Birkenhead thinks the British Government are trustees
for our welfare. We think that they hold us in bondage for their own
benefit. Trustees never charge as their commission seventy-five per
cent of the income of their wards. His Lordship says we cannot be a
nation with our 9 religions and 130 languages. We contend that, for
all practical purpose and for protection from outside the Indian
border, we are one nation. He thinks that Non-co-operation was a
dreadful mistake. The vast  majority of us think that it alone
awakened this sleeping nation from its torpor, it alone has given the
nation a force whose strength is beyond measure. The Swaraj Party is
a direct result of that force. He says that in Hindu-Mussalman
dissensions the British Government  have “kept their hands
unsullied”. It is the certain belief of almost every Indian that
they, the British Government, are principally responsible for most of
our quarrels. He thinks that we must co- operate with them. We say
that, when they mean well or when there is change of heart, they will
co-operate with us. He says that no gifted leader arose to make use
of the Reforms. We say that Messrs Sastri and Chintamani, not to
mention others, were gifted enough to make</p>

the Reforms a success but, in spite of all the good will in the
world, they found that they could not do so. Deshbandhu showed a way
out. His offer stands.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
But what hope is there of his offer being responded to in the spirit
in which it has been made? There are the different viewpoints which
make us English and Indians see things contrarywise. Is there any
chance, then, of finding a common meeting ground?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">Yes,
there is.</p>

We, the two peoples, occupy an unnatural position, i.e., of rulers
and ruled. We Indians must cease to think that we are the ruled. That
we can only do when we have some kind of force. We seemed to think we
had it in 1921 and so we fancied that swaraj was coming inside of a
year. Now no one dare prophesy. Let us gather that force—the non-
violent force of civil resistance—and we shall be equal. This is no
threat, no menace. It is a hard fact. And if I  do  not  nowadays
regularly criticize the acts of our ‘rulers’, as I used to
before, it is not because the fire of the civil resister has died
down in me, but because I am an economist of speech, pen and thought.
When I am ready, I shall speak freely. I have ventured to criticize
Lord Birkenhead’s pronouncement to tell the bereaved people of
Bengal in particular and of India in general that I feel the
unintended prick of Lord Birkenhead’s speech just as much as they
do, and that, whilst Motilalji will be fighting in the Assembly and
leading the Swaraj Party in the place of Deshbandhu, I shall be
leaving no stone unturned to prepare the atmosphere needed for civil
resistance—a vocation for which I seem to me to be more fitted than
for any other. Has not the singer of the <i>Gita </i>said, “Better
by far is the performance of one’s own dharma (duty), however
humble it may be, than another’s, however loftier it may be?”</p>

	trusted by the Khadi Mandal—have been refusing to return the money
	advanced to them by the Mandal. Some persons who offered to mediate

latter scrupulously returns it. Are there really Gujaratis who will

Through pride, maybe, or ignorance, or both, I thought that myself
and my co-workers were the only people who tried to keep all their
sons and daughters unmarried. But my pride has been humbled and my
ignorance has been dispelled. One of the volunteers attending on me
is a nephew of the Secretary of the local Congress Committee. Not
only is he himself unmarried, but his father wants all his brothers
to remain unmarried. If the young men themselves wish to marry, he
will agree to find suitable brides for them; he has no intention to
force them to remain unmarried against their will. But he is, at the
same time, so training his sons that they will resolve to remain
unmarried. All his sons are grown-up young men and settled in some
profession or other, but so far they have remained unmarried of their
own free will. I observe that in Bengal even girls are being trained
to remain unmarried. The number of such girls is very small, but the
movement does exist; it does not owe anything to Western influence;
the parents of the girls who are trying to train their daughters in
this manner are inspired solely by religious motives.</p>

No one can say definitely why people came to make a distinction
between the right hand and the left hand and  how  it became
customary to avoid using the left hand for doing  certain things and
to use, instead, the right hand. But the result, as we know, is that
for want of practice the left hand has become useless for many
purposes and also remains weaker than the right hand.</p>

I place this suggestion before the reader for his benefit in the
light of my present experience. It is more than twenty years since I
read about the practice in Japan. When I came to know of it, I
started learning to write with my left hand and acquired tolerable
proficiency in it. I now regret that I did not acquire the same speed
in writing with the left hand as I had with the right, thinking that
I could not afford</p>

the time required for that. Now my right hand does not give the
desired service in writing. It starts paining when I have written for
some time with it. Being anxious to retain as long as possible the
ability to write with the right hand, I have again started using the
left hand. I do not have time enough now to do all my writing with
the left hand and learn to write with it as fast as with the right
hand. But it has been serving me well whenever I am in difficulty; I
have, therefore, placed my experience in this matter before the
reader. Those who can spare the required time and are keen enough
should train themselves to write with the left hand too. Everyone who
does so will discover in the course of time the value of this
ability. Besides writing, it is useful to learn to do other things
too with the left hand. Most of us have come across many persons who
cannot even manage to eat with the left hand when the right hand has
become unserviceable for some reason. I hope that this note will make
no one go crazy about using the left hand. My only purpose in writing
it is to advise people to keep the left hand in practice as much as
they can in the ordinary course. It may be worth while for teachers
to follow this suggestion and train children in this manner.</p>

determined by the sum total of its activities. Moreover, we have been

people] on the basis of their social and political ethics. Social
morality will include such virtues as our capacity for organization,
fearlessness in social life, and so on. When our people have these
virtues we shall be able to secure the reins of government in our
hands. Moreover, at present swaraj means the freedom of British India
only. No doubt freedom will have the profoundest effect on Indian
States, but their problem will remain a separate one and will in all
probability solve itself when British India has won its freedom.
How-ever evil the rule in Indian States, British India can be free
today if it is strong enough. Hence, in judging what the country
deserves, we should take into account the actions of the people in
British India only. If we take into account the conditions in Indian
States as well, our conclusion will go wrong. Really speaking, the
Indian States represent British authority. They are subject to that
authority, are responsible to it and yet are not. Their
responsibility is limited to paying the tribute and remaining loyal
to it. In regard to their relation with their subjects, they are
almost independent. In any case, they are not responsible to the
subjects. This makes them more susceptible to the evil influences in
their environment. To put it in other words, they have many
temptations to rule oppressively. If they respect justice as much as
they do, it is because they still have some independent policy of
their own. The wonder is that, though the Indian States are free from
any control and though the British Government would welcome their
following a policy of oppression, they manage to  preserve  the
decency which they do. The credit for this goes to the ancient
civilization of India.</p>

By saying this, I am not defending the Indian States. I am only
trying to assess the situation as it is and am pointing out to
“Sevak” the flaw in his thinking, so as to help him to overcome
his feeling of despair. However bad the Indian States may be, if the
millions in the country who are directly under British rule display
the social virtues which a nation must possess, they can secure
control of the government. If they choose, the Indian States can help
the people to cultivate those virtues. But even if they do not help, 
or actually obstruct our efforts, the people can acquire them.</p>

We have often examined in the past what these requirements are—the
spinning-wheel, i.e., khadi, Hindu-Muslim unity and eradication of
untouchability. These things are necessary if we wish to secure
swaraj through peaceful means. None of them would be required if we
wished to win it with the sword. But, then, the freedom</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
we should then win would not be the people’s freedom; it would be
freedom for those with strength of arms. The people would have merely
exchanged one form of slavery for another : a brown-skinned Dyer
would not be more acceptable than the white-skinned one was. The
plight of the subjects of Indian States which “Sevak” bemoans
would then be the plight of the whole country, for the body of men
which would have wrested power from the British with the help of the
sword would hardly regard itself as responsible to the people. <i>Asi,
talwar, shamsher, </i>“sword”—all these terms denote the same
thing.</p>

At present British rule would certainly seem milder than the rule of
the Indian Princes. That indeed is the beauty of British rule. The
Government must please some people in order to run the
administration. The middle classes, therefore, do not have to submit
to perpetual injustice. Since British tyranny has a much wider field,
it is felt by a few individuals to be relatively mild and, because of
long familiarity, we do not even recognize it as tyranny. The slaves
in the southern States in the U.S.A. had come to love their condition
so much, because of their long familiarity with it that, when they
were set free, some of them broke into tears. They were faced with
serious problems such as where to go, what to do and how to earn
their livelihood. Many of us are in a similar condition. We do not
feel the subtle but nonetheless deadly tyranny of British rule. Many
victims of tuberculosis, though warned by doctors about their
condition are deceived by the flush on their cheeks, not knowing that
it is unnatural. They do not pay attention to the paleness of their
legs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
Let me warn the reader that I offer no plea for the Indian States;  I
am only describing the country’s sad plight. The Indian States may
be bad, but their badness is shielded by the British Government. On
superficial examination, British rule may seem better than the rule
of the Indian Princes, but in reality it is by no means so. The
British system of Government ruins the people physically, mentally
and spiritually. Indian Princes ruin their subjects physically for
the most part. If British rule gives place to people’s rule, I
believe the reform of the Indian States will follow as a matter of
course. If the rule of force by white British arms is replaced by
similar rule by brown arms, the change will bring no benefit to the
people nor reform the Indian States. Any thoughtful person will be
able to convince himself or herself of the truth of these two
statements.</p>

I give below the substance of what a Gujarati friend, after first
describing the present unhappy state of national education, writes :</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.64cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
When students are leaving the national schools and colleges, when the
workers grow slack and send their own children to Government schools
for education, when the pupils who still remain wear khadi only when
attending the national schools and the students who have obtained the
<i>snataka </i>degree do not know what profession to take up—in
these circumstances, how can we expect the national education
movement to survive? I hope you will not say that the <i>snatakas
</i>should go on spinning.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Every movement has its periods of ebb and flow before it succeeds in
its aim. It is the same with the national education movement. Only
those whose faith in it remains unshaken even during the periods of
ebb will in the end bring glory to it. Having faith in the cause of
national education, I am not afraid of a period of ebb but know that
ebb will surely be followed by flood. Hence those who have faith
should not lose it. The problem of employment for <i>snatakas </i>is
a complicated one. The national education movement has not yet
reached a stage when we can say that no <i>snataka </i>is in the
slightest worried about employment. Some of them will be absorbed in
the field of national education itself, but for the majority of them
there should be something else, and the only field is that of khadi.
That is the one field of national activity which throbs with life 
and  can employ the largest number of young men. <i>Snatakas </i>in
good numbers should come forward to work in it. Spinning as a means
of earning one’s livelihood is meant for the poorest. The work
which middle- class people can take up as a means of livelihood is
popularizing spinning. I see in Bengal that hundreds of young men can
make a modest living through such employment. I am collecting the
figures relating to this. I am sure people will be pleasantly
surprised by them.</p>

But this work is only for those young men who have faith in the power
of khadi and have the necessary patience to learn the various
processes connected with it. I concede that those who have no faith
in the spinning-wheel and in khadi will serve no useful purpose by
hanging on to national education.</p>

himself wished us to do as an all-Bengal Memorial, so do we know what
he would have wished us to do regarding an all-India Memorial. His
idea was clearly expressed over a year ago and repeated in his
Faridpur speech that village reconstruction was the thing dearest and
nearest to his heart for the regenerationof India and for the
attainment of swaraj along peaceful and evolutionary lines. We know,
too, that he believed that the beginning and the centre of such
activity lay in the revivalanddevelopmentofhand-spinningin villages
and universalization of khaddar. It is the one activity that can be
made common to all India and yet can be handled with the least cost.
It is the one activity that is calculated to yield immediate results,

universal propagation of the spinning-wheel and khaddar  and,
therefore, invite funds for that purpose. We refrain from naming the
sum required for this Memorial as it can absorb all it can receive.

I hope that the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial appeal will not in any
way disturb the all-Bengal Deshbandhu collection. The all- India
collection will last a considerable period, seeing that Bengal will
have paid a heavy sum for the All-Bengal Memorial. The collection in
Bengal for the All-India Memorial need not be made for three months
or a longer period if necessary. The attention of Bengal should not
be diverted from the all-Bengal collection. It must be a point of
honour with every Bengali and everyone domiciled in Bengal to make
the Bengal collection a full success. Over five lakhs have now  been
already paid. Though the balance, I take it, is assured, it is likely
to take longer than the first five lakhs unless the workers will
concentrate their effort on quickness in collection.</p>

Sjt. Manilal Kothari has shown what can be done in the direction by
specialists. In view of his success in inducing some of those who
have already paid to double and even to quadruple their
subscriptions, there is perhaps a possibility of some of the others,
who have already subscribed, paying a second and substantial
instalment. But,  apart  from this possibility, there are schools and
colleges left untouched. Will the Principals of these institutions or
the  students  themselves move, as I was told at the beginning of the
month that they would, as soon as these institutions were open after
the vacation? There are all the Bengal merchants and traders in the
busy centres of Calcutta mostly untouched. I could see, when I was
taken to some of these shops, that is was possible to collect, if not
the whole sum, at least a large part of it from these merchants.
Again, all the districts have not yet sent in their returns, nor have
the Bengalis from the other  provinces, except in some cases. Will
all these friends respond in good time?</p>

There was an informal meeting of the Swarajists and others on the 
17th  instant.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>It  was  a  representative   gathering.   All  
including myself felt that a revision of the franchise was necessary
and all felt that the self-spinning as an alternative should be
permanently retained, and not merely by way of trial, in the Congress
franchise. That means permanent recognition of the right of labour to
be directly represented in the Congress. All agreed that yarn as
distinguished from spinning franchise must be abolished. It had given
rise to hypocrisy and even dishonesty. The question of quantity to
self-spun yarn or cash sub-scription was held in abeyance. There was
a divergence of opinion. An overwhelming majority favoured also the
retention of khaddar- wearing as a permanent part of the franchise.
This is, in my opinion, a decided gain. The third proposition
unanimously agreed to was that an All-India Spinners’ Association
should be formed to be an integral part of the Congress, with
absolute powers, which would control the spinning part of the
Congress activity and act as the Congress Agency for receiving and
testing spinning subscriptions. The result, if the recommendations
are accepted, would</p>

The A.I.C.C. will meet on the 1st of October to consider the
proposal. It will meet without any restriction on the freedom of the
members. Not even those who were present at the informal meeting will
be bound by the vote they gave at it. If, on further consideration,
they think differently, they will be free to vote against the
proposals that will be submitted to the meeting. The members of the
A.I.C.C. will be free also to move amendments and criticize as they
please. Each one will vote as a Congressman or, better still, as an
Indian without any party obligation. As the reader will observe from
my letter to Panditji,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I have as a matter of duty absolved the Swaraj party
from any obligation under last year’s Pact. The propositions to be
submitted to the A.I.C.C. must be examined on merits. I do not desire
that any member, Swarajist or No-changer, should vote to placate me.
We are trying to evolve a democratic constitution. It is one’s
conscience alone which needs placating and no person, however great
he may be. For me there are no No-changers  and  Pro-changers.  Those
who advocate Council-entry and those who do not equally serve the
nation if their action or inaction is prompted by love of the
country. Indeed, I urge those who have no absolute scruples against
Council-entry immediately to join the Swaraj Party and strengthen its
hands.</p>

I hope that every member of the A.I.C.C. will attend the forthcoming
meeting, take part in the proceedings and register his opinion.
Personally I do not want the matter to be decided by a majority of
votes. Whetever is done must be done by almost absolute unanimity.</p>

What is proposed is a vital change in the  constitution. Ordinarily
the A.I.C.C. should not interfere with it. But there are moments when
it will be disloyal not to do so. If the overwhelming opinion in the
country requires a change that admits of no delay, it is the most
proper thing for the A.I.C.C. to make the change and take the
consequences of having its decision revoked and its action censured
by the Congress. An agent has always the right to anticipate the
unexpressed wished of his principal when he acts in the latter’s
interest and at his own peril. I have, therefore, no hesitation  in
saying that, if an overwhelming majority of the members of the</p>

A.I.C.C. desire the change above fore-shadowed, it would be wrong on
their part by hesitation to waste precious three months of the 
nation. The Cawnpore Congress should be relieved of the necessity of 
a prolonged discussion over a matter which could well be decided by
the A.I.C.C. Its time should be left free for tackling larger
problems.</p>

Let it be also noted that the Congress will, under the scheme
sketched by me, become a predominantly political body, taking the
adjective in its generally accepted sense. Swarajists will become, as
they ought to be, the Congress, instead of being its chief and only
political agents. That is the least answer that the A.I.C.C. can make
to Lord Birkenhead.</p>

people like Dr. Besant persevere in their attempt to secure freedom
in spite of the communal dissensions. There is room for both—those
who seek freedom despite differences and those who seek to remove
differences for the sake of paving the road to freedom.</p>

What has been known as “Alwar atrocities” came before the
Congress Working Committee that met in Calcutta, in the form of a</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
motion by Sjt. Jamnalal Bajaj for the appointment of a committee of
inquiry. Now it has been long a tradition of the Congress not to
interfere in the internal affairs of Indian States. The members of
the Committee felt that it was a healthy tradition which it would be
unwise to break. Sjt. Jamnalalji then did not press his motion. I
told him, however, that I should discuss the question in these pages
and give my reasons for my personal opinion that the Congress should
not interfere in the internal administration of the Indian States.
This may, if one chooses to put it so, be regarded as a virtue of
necessity or a matter of policy, It is both and perhaps a little
more. It must  be frankly admitted that the Congress possesses no
authority  for enforcing its will in Indian States even to the extent
it does in British India proper. Prudence, therefore, dictates
inaction  where  action would be waste of effort, if not folly. But
if inaction is prudential, it is also benevolent. The Congress seeks
not to embarrass the States, it desires to help them. It does not
wish to destroy them, it wishes to reform them. And this the Congress
for the moment  does  by abstention as an earnest of its goodwill.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
But abstention by the Congress does not mean absence of effort on the
part of Congressmen. Those who have any relation with the States will
no doubt use their influence. The local committes can help and guide
the distressed people so long as they do not come in clash with
authority. Nor does the Congress regulate or control the action of
individual Congressmen. But when they take action, they do so not as
Congressmen. The position of the Congress must not be compromised.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
May the subjects of Indian States then expect no relief from the
Congress which claims to be a national institution? I fear the answer
must  be  party  in  the  negative.   They   may   not   expect   any
 direct assistance. But indirect assistance they do get. For, to the
measure that the Congress becomes powerful and efficient, to that
measure also is levelled up the condition  of the  subjects  of the
Indian  States.  The  moral  pressure  of the  Congress  must  be  
felt all over the land either directly or indirectly. I hope,
therefore, the afflicted people will realize that, if the Congress
does not offer any direct help, it is not for want of will, but it is
entirely due to want of ability and opportunity.</p>

pardoned for saying that the unemployed can find industrial
occupation in hand-weaving. But I am free to confess that the Anglo-
Indian with his present training may be ill-fitted for weaving unless
he is gifted with an exceptionally strong will. It is difficult to
give advice on a hypothetical question. It is for an enterprising and
philanthropic Anglo-Indian to prepare a census of the unemployed and
then think out occupations for which the community is best fitted and
prepare for training them therein.</p>

they grow to like spinning even as a sacrament; but there is no
reason to delay over the use of khaddar. A jacket made of khaddar is
as serviceable as the one made of foreign cloth and  bed-sheets  of
khaddar are better to the touch than the ordinary mill manufacture.
It is the feeling of kinship with the masses that is needed to induce
Anglo-Indians to use khaddar.  That is, in my opinion, the first step
to  a real spirit of nationalism.</p>

Under the proposed change, a cash subscription will be accepted in
lieu of yarn. If hitherto Anglo-Indians have not joined, it is
largely due to their unwillingness. If it is suggested that the
Congress should have made a special effort to enlist their support, I

It was an ennobling sight, the meeting of ladies at Rajshahi. Like
their sisters in the University Institute, they poured in their
rupees and their ornaments. They have, indeed, done so everywhere.
But at Rajshahi it was a never-ending flow. They had also a grand
spinning competition in which over two hundred ladies must have taken
part. One of them was an accomplished spinner of fine yarn, possibly
finer even than that of Aparna Devi who only the other day came
first-class first. She showed on her own person a sari of exceedingly
fine yarn which she said she had spun herself. But almost every one
of the wheels, including this lady’s, was a useless noise-making
toy, yielding poor results in quantity. The maker of these wheels,
Babu Taraknath Maitra, is an enthusiast. But he is a blind
enthusiast. He knows something of mechanism, but knows nothing of
spinning-wheels. I do not think he knows even the principles of
spinning. I must plead with him to desist from inflicting his
machines on these cultured and patriotic sisters of Rajshahi. If he
makes these wheels for profit, let him withdraw them and make proper
wheels. If he makes them from</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-top: 0.05cm">love of
service, let him destroy the useless things, study the science of</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the wheel and not make another till he has acquainted himself with
the best wheel. I have known in Bengal only three patterns which can
at all be claimed to be good wheels. Of these three, the Khadi
Pratishthan pattern has appealed to me as the best. The second is
what is used by the workers at Duadando. Its speciality is that the
spindle is kept slanting. A third is the old Bengal pattern with a
short platform and a heavy revolving wheel and a long spindle. The
tests of a good wheel are: (1) noiselessness, and (2) yield of at
least 400 yards of yarn of ten counts per hour by an ordinary
spinner. I have heard that the other two patterns have been known to
yield 600 yards of at least ten counts per hour. I have seen the
Khadi Pratishthan wheel yield over 850 yards per hour. All its
workers can spin 400 yards per hour on the Khadi Pratishthan pattern.
Let the manufacturers of wheels know that they are injuring the cause
when they put on the market a noisy charkha that will not yield the
average quantity. I warn the workers, too, against putting
below-standard wheels in the hands of spinners, professional or
voluntary, when they know that they can get wheels that answer the
standard that I have laid down. If any man in Bengal has a better
wheel, let him send it on to me. I promise to test it and report the
result without undue delay. Spinning is a matter of life and death
for the masses. Let not those who are engaged in spreading it indulge
in waste that a little knowledge can easily prevent.</p>

cri-tics who say that I am an apologist of the Western ways. I
consider them childish. For they have not understood my views, nor by
living with me understood my life. If I once accept something, as  a
satyagrahi I stub-bornly cling to it. Satyagraha here does not mean
what it is commonly understood to mean. Satyagraha, in its correct
meaning, is holding on to truth. I openly proclaim any Western ideas
that I wish to propagate. For instance, with reference to <i>Ayurveda
</i>I said once that, in the matter of health, we have far less to
teach the West than we have to learn from it.</p>

I consider myself a <i>sanatani </i>Hindu. It increases our anguish
when we have to suffer at the hands of outsiders. I have repeatedly
said that I accept the system of <i>Varnashrama. </i>But I wish to
cleanse it of the caste distinctions that have crept into it. It is
my belief that Hinduism is non-violent.</p>

Please sheathe the sword of ostracism. This is not the time for it. 
If a man marries off his very young daughter, you at once apply
ostracism against him, but, if a man is a libertine and eats flesh,
you do nothing to ostracize him. Practice of ostracism in this manner
will ultimately lead to the ostracized becoming a separate caste and
to an increase of discord in the community. Thus, when I went to
England in 1887, I found on my return that, while some of my caste
accepted me, some others ostracized me. I, however, have no grievance
against my caste on that account. My policy is one of non-violence. I
have  no desire to cause them pain. I eat with untouchables. I also
eat with Muslims. There has been no protest from my caste over this.
They do not invite me to communal meals, but they invite my people.
We should not condemn anyone for his being a reformer. We should not
ostracize him. If you want to unite the Hindus, do not exaggerate
small things nor make light of big things. Now when castes have
become so hybridized and immorality is so widespread, when we are not
able even to guard our own honour, whom can we ostracize? The better
course would be to ostracize ourselves; that is the way of self-</p>

I am happy that, among the Hindus, the Marwari community enjoys
affluence. I know also that it know how to make money and that it
does so. I am not unaware either that your community is well- known
for its generosity. The Marwaris know equally well the art of making
money and of spending it. I know all this well enough. But, with all
this, they have a failing, and that failing is very marked : they
waste money. The Marwaris, it is true, earn money and also spend it
on good works; it is usually their desire to have some religious
cause to support. But generally they do not spend their money
properly. I would, therefore, say to the Marwaris that they should
keep certain things in mind when they spend money, thinking they are
putting it to a good use. It is necessary to give great thought to
the question of spending money. You should make quite sure, before
you spend money, that you are making good use of it. Since you are
charitable and generous, it is all the more necessary for you to be
thoughtful in spending. You must be aware that in America there are
millionaires and multi-millionaires who are far richer than you.
There used to be a millionaire called Carnegie there (I do not know
whether he is alive now). It was his peculiarity that he would be
guided in his actions entirely by his own ideas. He paid absolutely
no attention to the ideas of others. One day it occurred to him to
spend his money for some good cause. And lo and behold—he started
shipping his wealth to Scotland. He did it to support libraries in
Scotland. The teachers of Scotland, however, wrote him a letter
requesting him to spare Scotland his charitable attentions. So we
must be very careful how we disburse money. We must think hard before
we undertake anything. You have necessarily to exercise care and
discretion while spending money. You must understand that, unless you
do so, you will not be making the right use of your money. Therefore,
for a community so generous as yours care and discretion are of great
importance.</p>

I have fallen in love with the Parsi community. I should like to
state here that the Parsis occupy the first place in generosity. The
Jews come next. And I feel sad to say that the third place is that of
the Marwaris among Hindus. I have myself seen how generous Parsis are
and what great care they exercise in spending even the smallest sum.
I shall, therefore, say here no more than that you Marwaris should
show that among Hindus, too, there is at least one community that
knows both how to earn money and how to spend it.</p>

My views about cow-protection are well known. I have repeatedly
stated that it is a very noble work. But I cannot  help saying also
that it needs to be improved. I myself dabbled in it, but I did not
get any great response. I have a fair amount of experience of this
work. I have been at it for some thirty years. I have also done some
<i>tapasya</i>. As for the response from people, I once requested a
Marwari friend to accept the treasurership of a cow-protection fund,
but he refused, although my intention in making him the treasurer was
not to ask him for any excessive financial assistance. All the same,
I must emphatically assert that, if the Marwari community cannot take
up this work of cow-protection, if it cannot save the cow, I do not
see which other community can. In other words, if Marwaris cannot
save the cow, then no one among the Hindus can. But, for
cow-protection  a number of things are needed. It needs application
and time quite as much as money. So, when considering this question,
we must keep in mind these three requirements as well as other
things. Then alone can we make any satisfactory progress in this
work.</p>

	My own position is clear. The Congress has appointed the Swarajist
	Party its agents for conducting the political campaign, therefore,
	every individual Congressman can say that the Swarajist Party is its
	agent for the political work. When he finds that he cannot endorse
	the sum total of the Swarajist activity, he can secede from the
	Congress or he can resist in the Congress. My own individual
	position  is neither the one nor the other. If I must have any
	political representative on behalf of the Congress in the Councils,
	I can only appoint the Swarajist Party because of its fighting
	capacity and this I can say in spite of my being against
	Council-entry on principle. As an Indian I have to make a choice
	between thieves and the police, and though both are alike
	unacceptable to me as a believer in ahimsa, I cannot divest myself
	of responsibility as a social bein[g] and, therefore, must
	continually make my choice. It is because of this difficulty that
	our sages have made room for the cave-dwellers who do not want to
	share the responsibility for the actions of their fellow-men. They

which grow without human agency. I do not consider my se[lf] fit for
that state. I remain in human society and, therefore, consistently
with my individual views make myself responsible, where it is
inevitable, for many acts which I cannot otherwise approve.
Similarly, I have not yet bee[n] brought to the pitch of saying I do
not want to [be] in the Congress. The agency of the Swarajist Party
is strictly limited in its scope. I recognize its agency so far as
the general political work is concerned. I do not make myself
responsible for the character or the conduct of individual
Swarajists. I wonder if I have made myself intelligible. You know the
further step I have taken in view of Lord Birkenhead’s speech and,
of course, Deshbandhu’s death. I must no longer prevent the
Congress from becoming a predominantly political body by the force of
my person; hence the letter to Punditji. But my decision need not
affect that of a single Congressman unless it commends itself to his
reason. I have simply stated my own personal opinion and, as I do not
consider it to be binding on anybody in any shape or form and as I
though[t] that an announcement of that character at the present
moment would strengthen the Swarajist Party, I wrote the letter
without any hesitation. For yourself, you know the local
circumstances, and if you find that your indirect endorsement of the
Swarajist Party will be to me your endorsement of the views and
character of individual Swarajists, you will not hesitate to sever
your connection with the Congress, while still retaining the resolute
determination not to say anything against the Swarajist Party. More

	I must confess to you that I know very little of the life of Kristo-

	and, as a busy man that I was in South Africa, I was not able to
	keep myself in touch with all that was going on in India. It is a
	humiliating confession, but I must make that confession to you. At
	the same time, I feel honoured in that I was invited to be present
	at  this  function. It is a matter of privilege to me that I can
	associate myself with you in the tributes that will be paid, this
	evening, to the memory of that great and illustrious countryman of
	ours. His grandson has been kind enough to place at my disposal some
	literature dealing with his writings and, during the spare moments I
	could get yesterday, I came upon a passage in one of his writings
	bearing upon Home Rule.  I little thought that, even in his bad
	time, that great man thought out things which we are today
	endeavouring to the best of our ability to reduce to practice. He
	gave us those ideas of freedom which we are today endeavouring to
	translate into action. I have read also  something else from his
	writings. As a youth I knew this much that he was one of the
	greatest journalists of his time, that he was a fearless patriot,
	but with his fearlessness he combined a polished and cultured
	courtesy which never left in anything that he wrote a sting behind.
	We of the present generation, in our attempt to attain our freedom,
	need to treasure the lesson that we have inherited from the great
	man; we need also to copy his fearlessness and gentleness, because
	fearlessness without gentleness is mere brag and bluster.</p>

The young men who have gathered together to do honour to the memory

that, even at his time of day, he has lost nothing for having been
courteous. On the contrary, we are enabled to treasure  his memory
because he never lost sight of the fact that a man, who has to deal
with opponents, and who has to wring freedom from unwilling hands,
has still need to be gentle and courteous. May I translate it in my

with it is non-violence. I have summed up all these gentle virtues in
that oneword which we have inherited from the <i>rishis </i>of old.

are mistaken. I have heard the expression “Tammany Hall” applied.
Dismiss it from your minds. I should be the first to renounce such
methods. The only methods that my country can rise through are
methods which are above board. If I have thrown my lot into the

I do not wish to stand in the way of either of these demands. This
does not mean that I myself want these changes. But I appreciate
popular opinion, believe in its importance and respect it. When that
opinion seems unacceptable to me, I believe it my duty to oppose it
at my cost—not at the cost of people’s interests. In this case, I
have no ground for opposing it. Popular opinion with the Congress
means the opinion of the educated class. The Congress is the creation
of this class. It, which means the educated class, has rendered many
services to the country. I  cannot  forget  these  merely  because 
of my differences with that class. As I look at the matter, I must
carry  the educated class with me in my attempt to convert the
Congress into a mass organization. We cannot be true representatives
of the masses so long as we do not do physical work to qualify
ourselves for membership of the Congress. But I have not been able to
convince the educated class of this. A few individuals have
understood it, but the class as a whole has not responded. I must
have patience and make it as easy as possible for the educated class
to join the Congress. While Deshbandhu lived, my responsibility in
this matter was, I felt, not so heavy. He and Motilalji served as a
link between the educated class and me. With the passing away of one
of them, I see that it has become my clear duty to understand the
predicament of Motilalji. I see that educated people feel it as a
burden even to buy hand-spun yarn and offer it as a subscription, for
they lack faith in spinning. The result has been that the work of the
Congress suffers from hypocrisy and insincerity. One and the same
bundle of yarn has sometimes done duty for several numbers. The
danger of such abuse had been pointed out to me even at Belgaum, but
I had made light of it. I thought that everyone would obey the rule
and, in any case, no one would practise deception. My reasoning has
been proved wrong.  I think, therefore, that the rule about buying
yarn and giving it must be dropped.  Panditji and other Swarajists
felt that, in view of the pact<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>between them and me, they could not ask me to agree to
the repeal of the rule even though they wanted it to be repealed.
Hence I decided that I should free them from their feeling of being
bound, but that I myself should not endorse the change which they
desire. I have already written to him to this effect.</p>

practice of paying money instead of buying yarn and giving it. It
seemed to be their unanimous view that those who preferred to give
their labour to the people should have a permanent place in the
Congress. I was very happy indeed about this. I welcome  this measure
of tolerance. This decision means that spinning will always have a
place in the Congress programme. It remains to be seen how many
people with faith in spinning we get. If the All-India Congress
Committee<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>adopts this change, we shall know who are sincere about
spinning.</p>

The second requirement of the franchise clause is the obliga- tion to
wear khadi. A majority of the Swarajists do not want this  rule to be
repealed. If the educated class sincerely allows this condition to
stand, I would regard it as the greatest good fortune of the country.
It is desirable that the change which is made now should be made and
the conditions which are retained should be retained not as
experimental measures but as permanent features and because members
want them.</p>

The third issue is about the Swaraj Party getting the leadership of
the Congress instead of remaining its representative or an
intermediary [between the Congress and the Government]. I think that,
in the situation which faces us, it is not proper to continue a kind
of boycott of the Swarajist movement in the Congress. It seems
desirable, instead, that the particular work of the Swarajists should
become the main acti-vity of the Congress and that spinning and
propagation of khadi should be carried on through people who function
as intermediaries [between the Congress and the  people]. The
spinning-wheel movement does not need the prestige of the Congress
name as much as the Swarajists need it. The former depends for its
success entirely on constructive work, whereas the success of the
latter’s activities depends on cultivation of public opinion. I,
therefore, intend to propose at the forthcoming meeting of the All-
India Congress Committee that it should accord the Swaraj Party the
dominant place and set up a separate body to promote spinning, make
this body a part of the Congress and entrust it with the
responsibility of carrying on the movement. If this is done, it will
also make the propagation of khadi easier in a way, and the body set
up to promote spinning, not being dependent on votes, will also be
free from the uncertainty resulting from changes in public opinion.
Once a public opinion in favour of spinning has come into existence,
the spread of the movement depends wholly on money and management,
that is, on</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
business ability. Hence the body to be set up should be the business
wing of the Congress.  The leaders assembled<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>in Calcutta seemed to be in favour of this too.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
My duty is as clear to me  as  daylight.  I  should  help the Swaraj
Party to the best of my ability and within the limits of my
principles, should not oppose political  work  becoming  the  princi-
pal activity of the Congress and advise the All-India Congress
Committee to amend the franchise clause so as to permit members to
pay money instead  of their being required to buy yarn and give it.
This is also the duty, it seems to me, of others in A.I. C.C. who
are, like me, No-changers. There is, however, no in-tention to
present a formal compact to the forthcoming A.I.C.C. Every member may
exercise his freedom I have not bound anyone in any way. I have freed
the Swaraj Party from its obligation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and,
therefore, both  the Swarajists and the No-changers will be able to
vote according to their inclination, and I want them do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
One issue remains to be examined. Can the A.I.C.C., a body with
powers delegated by the Congress, amend a rule laid down by the
latter? Ordinarily, it cannot do so, but in extra-ordinary
circumstances and in the interest of the Congress itself, it
certainly can. A person holding a power of attorney from someone, or
an agent, has no authority at all to exceed the limits prescribed by
his employer. But he can venture a great deal at his own risk and in
the interest of the latter. The risk he will run is that the employer
may revoke the power of attorney. If any loss results from the agent
acting at his own risk, he is bound to bear it, since no agent can,
without his employer’s permission, do anything which might put the
latter to loss. In short, the employer is entitled to receive the
benefit of anything done by the agent in excess of his authority, but
has no obligation to bear the loss. According to this principle, if
the A.I.C.C., at its own risk, makes any changes without specific
authority, it will run two risks: one of them is the possibility of
the Congress condemning its action as improper; the other is, if the
A.I.C.C., when faced with a difficult situation, does not disregard
the constitution and take necessary action to meet it, it will have
proved its timidity and incompetence.</p>

Just as Bengal has decided to collect a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs for a
memorial to Deshbandhu and to start, in his ancestral home, a
hospital for women to be named after him and an institution for
training nurses, so the country as a whole should also decide to do
something to perpetuate his sacred memory. I had been consulting
Bengali friends what should be done, but being of the view that I
should make no suggestion before the advice of Motilalji, I did not
publicly express my ideas on the subject. I have now had discussions
with Panditji, the revered Basanti Devi and Deshbandhu’s close
associates and followers, and have issued an appeal under some
signatures, a translation of which the reader will find on the first
page.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have showed clearly that Deshbandhu had finally come to believe so
firmly in the spinning-wheel and khadi that, leaving these, we should
think of no other means of perpetuating his memory.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
If anyone asks why we should not have a statue or some other similar
form of memorial, the reply is that such local memorials will be put
up in many cities. We should think of something through which
Deshbandhu will be remembered even by growing boys and girls, by the
rich and the poor, something which will be in the nature of a
permanent blessing for the country and which is not beyond our means.
The only thing of this kind is the spinning-wheel and khadi.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
But, what about the parliamentary activities? It is doubtful if
Deshbandhu’s memory can be kept alive for ever through these. The
work will certainly go on, but we know Deshbandhu himself has said</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
that these activities are of passing importance and that their field
is limited. Khadi work is the only activity which can engage everyone
and which concerns everyone.</p>

Such questions were also raised when, after the Lokamanya’s death,
there was a proposal for a memorial to him.  But afterwards it was
admitted by all that he had spent his life in giving to  the  country
the message : “Swaraj is my  birthright.” Deshbandhu’s task and
ours was to take up that message and think out universal and enduring
scope for carrying it into effect. Among these, we gave the first
place to the spinning-wheel and khadi, and, through them, to the
boycott of foreign cloth. Deshbandhu’s work thus lay  in organizing
the means. This is why, during the last year of  his  life, he was
always exhorting people to take up village reconstruction. He harped
on this in the Assembly and also as a Mayor, and in his speech at
Faridpur he stated plainly that lawyers might go on with
parliamentary work but ordinary people should devote themselves to
village reconstruction. In Darjeeling he finally came to the
conclusion that village reconstruction meant the spinning-wheel and
khadi. Deshbandhu saw clearly that, in the solar system of the means
of swaraj, the spinning-wheel held the place of the sun, and he even
sent a message to his followers that they should take up the work of
village reconstruction through it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
This was Deshbandhu’s last will and testament in politics. It is
our duty to water the seed which he sowed and help it to grow into a
tree. Hence, promoting the spinning-wheel movement is the only right
way of perpetuating his memory.</p>

Let us now consider how much we should raise. Contrary to my usual
practice, I have not specified a particular sum which we should
collect, for there is no upward limit to the figure.  Moreover, 
wherever  I lay down a particular figure, it becomes a very heavy
weight on my mind and I insist on its being reached at any cost. This
time, too, I have fixed a figure in my mind and I insist on its being
reached at any cost; but I do not want to involve in it the friends
who have signed the appeal with me. Out of their regard for me and
faith in the people, they would subscribe to the figure and invite a
responsibility on themselves, but they would not be able to give all
or most of their time for reaching the figure.</p>

As pointed out in the leaflet, the contributions we get will depend
on three things: people’s love for Deshbandhu, their faith in khadi
and the spinning-wheel and their confidence in the trustees. The
whole country has demonstrated its love for Deshbandhu. My experience
is that people’s faith in khadi and the spinning-wheel is steadily
growing. The trustees are known to the country. With a man  of
transparent honesty like Jamnalalji as treasurer and an equally
conscientious and upright secretary in Jawaharlal, there can be no
reason for distrust.</p>

This trend of thought is entirely correct; however, it should not
have arisen as a result of my article. All of us desire <i>moksha,
</i>whether consciously or unconsciously. In my article, however, I
considered only the value of the service rendered by workers. In
addition, I also discussed, in passing, the kind of service that the
people welcome today. The world hardly knows true sannyasis. These
keep working  in an invisible manner. To them, praise is as good as
censure; in other words, it could be said that they fight shy of
praise. In my article I discussed no such persons at all. Moreover,
the service of those whose motive is to gain praise has little value.
Monuments to honour them as well as the so-called sannyasis have been
raised and will continue to be raised.  In the  article, the
reference was only to such selfless service as was rendered by
Deshbandhu and, in this connection, I indicated</p>

that in the present age those who come forward to safeguard the
people’s freedom are worshipped. Such persons could hardly afford
to remain unseen. In other words, one who works in the political
field cannot possibly remain hidden. For him, there is no other
alternative but to come into contact with thousands of people, hence
the world cannot fail to take note of this service. We should be
aware of one thing alone viz., even those workers who were frauds
have had monuments erected intheir honour;  we should, therefore,
guard ourselves against the temptation of doing anything in order to
win glory. We should ratherfight shy of it. However, when we find
that people have been showering affection on an illustrious worker
like Deshbandhu, we realize that they readily appreciate service
rendered for the welfare of others. Moreover, though their assessment
is sometimes wrong, it is more often right. Our dharma today is to
serve the country in a non-violent and truthful manner. All of us
should contribute our share of service, while maintaining an
indifference towards the resulting praise or blame.</p>

I have omitted from this letter portions dealing with  certain facts.
The caution is quite relevant. The purpose of the correspondent is to
state that we should not be greedy and that we should do nothing
which might go against the responsibility which has been entrusted to
us. We should have nothing to do with the private affairs of our
host. Where is the room for a personal connection when the
relationship is a public one? Wherever a volunteer happens to stay,
he does so not because of any personal friendship but only because of
his work, and therefore regards the place as a guest-house. Moreover,
one who desires to be pure always avoids meeting a woman when she is
alone. This is the dharma not only of the volunteer but also of a
friend, a guest, a dependent and of every man. No one should sleep
near a married couple’s room. This is gentlemanly conduct.
Unfortunately, we do not have such facilities in our houses and we do
not have the habit of practising such discretion; however, there can
be no difference of opinion regarding the propriety and necessity of
having a married couple’s room away from those of others. The

Lokamanya lived and died for swaraj. He taught us to believe that
swaraj was our birthright. I know that we cannot regain this
birthright of ours without reinstating the charkha in our villages in
its ancient dignity. This we cannot do unless we,  the educated
class, learn the beautiful life-giving art of spinning and wear
khadi, whether  it is coarse or fine, whether it is dear or cheap. No
price is too great to pay for swaraj. If, then, we would honour  the 
memory  of Lokamanya, let us solemnly resolve to spin at least half
an hour every day and habitually wear khadi and induce others to do
likewise.</p>

	interested in solving the same question, whether as friends,
	opponents or neutrals. I am now corresponding with Mr. C.
	Rajagopalachari, who, as you know, is my co-worker in this matter,
	and on whose judgment I place the greatest reliance. I am asking him
	even to go to Vaikom or Trivandrum if necessary. Meanwhile I shall
	continue to observe perfect reticence in public. No forward step
	will be taken without due notice to you and without the greatest
	deliberation. The assurance you have given me that the authorities
	are doing their best to remove the evil is a great temptation for me
	to fall in with your suggestion. But from this distance I do not
	want to trust to my unaided judgment.</p>

You seem to have taken it for granted that I hate the British. What
makes you think so? I have hundreds of friends among the British
people. I cannot love the Mussalmans and for that matter the Hindus
if I hate the British. My love is not an exclusive affair. If I hate
the British today, I would have to hate the Mohammedans tomorrow and
the Hindus the day after. But what I do detest is the system of
government that the British have set up in my country. It has almost
brought about the economic and moral ruin of the people of India. But
just as I love my wife and my children, in spite of their faults
which are many, I love also the British in spite of the bad system
for which they have unfortunately made themselves responsible. That
love which is blind is no love, that love which shuts its eyes to the
faults of loved ones is partial and even dangerous. You must write
again if this letter does not satisfy you.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup></p>

I have your letter. I am convinced that without Malaviyaji and
Shraddhanandji Hindu-Muslim unity is impossible to achieve. I can
only guide and when stray quarrels take place, do something about
them if I can. My task is that of a scavenger: to work for and ensure

I had the pleasure of delivering an address before the missionaries
in Calcutta at Y.M.C.A. on 28th ultimo. I have been supplied with
shorthand notes of that address, and as it was of general interest I
reproduce below an abridgment of it. I have omitted  onsalient

myself in London; and that association has grown riper as years have
rolled on. In South Africa, where I found myself in the midst of
inhospitable surroundings, I was able to make hundreds of Christian
friends. I came in touch with the late Mr. Spencer Watton, Director
of South Africa General Mission, and, later,</p>
<p class="western">with the great divine, Rew. Mr. A. Murray and
several others.</p>

My acquaintance, therefore, this evening with so many missionaries is
by no means a new thing. There was even a time in my life when a very
sincere and intimate friend of mine, a great and good Quaker, had
designs on me. (Laughter.) He thought that I was too good not to
become a Christian. I was sorry to have disappointed him. One
missionary friend of mine in South Africa still writes to me and asks
me, ‘How is it with you?’ I have always told this friend that so
far as I know, it is all well with me. If it was prayer that these
friends expected me to make, I was able to tell them that every day
the heart- felt prayer within the closed door of my closet went to
the Almighty to show me light and give wisdom and courage to follow
that light.</p>

In answer to promises made to one of these Christian friends of mine,
I thought it my duty to see one of the biggest of Indian Christians,
as I was told he was,—the late Kali Charan Banerjee. I went over to
him—I am telling you of the deep search that I have undergone in
order that I might leave no stone unturned to find out the true
path—I went to him with an absolutely open mind and in a receptive
mood, and I met him also under circumstances which were most
affecting. I found that there was much in common between Mr. Banerjee
and myself. His simplicity, his humility, his courage, his</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
truthfulness, all these things I have all along admired. He met me
when his wife was on her death-bed. You cannot imagine a more
impressive scene, a more ennobling circumstance. I told Mr. Banerjee,
‘I have come to you as a seeker,’—this was in 1901—‘I have
come to you in fulfilment of a sacred promise I have made to some of
my dearest Christian friends that I will leave no stone unturned to
find out the true light.’ I told him that I had given my friends
the assurance that no worldly gain would keep me away from the light,
if I could but see it. Well, I am not going to engage you in giving a
description of the little discussion that we had between us. It was
very good, very noble. I came away, not sorry, not dejected, not
disappointed, but I felt sad that even Mr. Banerjee could not
convince me. This was my final deliberate striving to realize
Christianity as it was presented to me. Today my position is that
though I admire much in Christianity,  I am unable to identify myself
with orthodox Christianity. I must tell you in all humility that
Hinduism as I know it, entirely satisfies my soul, fills my whole
being and I find a solace in the <i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita </i>and
Upanishads that I miss even in the Sermon on the Mount. Not that I do
not prize the ideal presented therein, not that some of the precious
teachings in the Sermon on the Mount have not left a deep impression
upon me, but I must confess to you that when doubts haunt me, when
disappointments stare me in the face, and when I see not one ray of
light on the horizon I turn to the <i>Bhagavad </i><i>Gita, </i>and
find a verse to comfort me; and I immediately begin to smile in the
midst of overwhelming sorrow. My life has been full of external
tragedies and if they have not left any visible and indelible effect
on me, I owe it to the teaching of the <i>Bhagavad</i><i> </i><i>Gita.</i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
I have told you all these things in order to make it absolutely clear
to you where I stand, so that I may have, if you will, closer touch
with you. I must  add  that  I  did not stop  at  studying  the Bible
 and  the  commentaries  and  other   books   on   Christianity  that
my friends placed in my hands; but I said to myself, if I was to find
my satisfaction through reasoning, I must study the scriptures of
other religions also and make my choice. And I turned to the Koran. 
I tried to understand what I could of Judaism as distinguished from
Christianity. I studied Zoroastrianism and I came to the conclusion
that all religions were right, but every one of them imperfect,
imperfect naturally and necessarily,—because they were interpreted
with our poor intellects, sometimes with our poor hearts, and more
often misinterpreted. In all religions, I found to my grief, that
there</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
were various and even contradictory interpretations of some texts,
and I said to myself, ‘Not these things for me. If I want the
satisfaction of my soul, I must feel my way. I must wait silently
upon God and ask Him to guide me.’ There is a beautiful verse in
Sanskrit which says ‘God helps only when man feels utterly helpless
and utterly humble’. Some of you have come from the Tamil land.
When I was studying Tamil, I found in one of the books of Dr. Pope a
Tamil proverb which means‘ God helps the helpless’. I have given
you this life- story of my own experience for you to ponder over.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
You, the missionaries come to India thinking that you come to a land
of heathens, of idolators, of men who do not know God. One of the
greatest of Christian divines, Bishop Heber, wrote the two lines
which have always left a sting with me: “Where every prospect
pleases, and man alone is vile.” I wish he had not written them. My
own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the
contrary. I have gone from one end of the country to the other,
without any prejudice, in a relentless search after truth, and I am
not able to say that here in this fair land, watered by the great
Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Jumna, man is vile. He is not vile.
He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are, possibly more
so. This reminds me of a French book translated for me by a French
friend. It  is an account of an imaginary expedition in search of
knowledge. One party landed in India and found Truth andGod
personified, in a little pariah’s hut. I tell you there are many
such huts belonging to the untouchables where you will certainly find
God. They do not reason but they persist in their belief that God is.
They depend upon God for His assistance and find it too. There are
many stories told throughout the length and breadth of India about
these noble untouchables. Vile as some of them may be, there are
noblest specimens of humanity in their midst. But does my experience
exhaust itself merely with the untouchables? No. I am here to tell
you that there are non-Brahmins, there are Brahmins who are as fine
specimens of humanity as you will find in any place on the earth.
There are Brahmins today in India who are embodiments of self-
sacrifice, godliness, and humility. There are Brahmins who are
devoting themselves body and soul to the service of untouchables,
with no expectation of reward from the untouchables, but with
execration from orthodoxy. They do not mind it, because in serving
pariahs they are serving God. I can quote chapter and verse from my
experience. I place these facts before you in all humility for the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
simple reason that you may know this land better, the land to which
you have come to serve. You are here to find out the distress of the
people of India and remove it. But I hope you are here also in a
receptive mood and, if there is anything that India has to give, you
will not stop your ears, you will not close your eyes and steel your
hearts, but open up your ears, eyes and, most of all, your hearts to
receive all that may be good in this land. I give you my assurance
that there is a great deal of good in India. Do not flatter
yourselves with the belief that a mere recital of that celebrated
verse in St. John makes a man a Christian. If I have read the Bible
correctly, I know many men who have never heard the name of Jesus
Christ or have even rejected the official interpretation of
Christianity will, probably, if Jesus came in our midst today in the
flesh, be owned by him more than many of us. I therefore ask you to
approach the problem before you with open-heartedness, and humility.</p>

I was engaged in a friendly conversation with some missionaries this
morning. I do not want to relate that conversation. But I do want  to
say that they are fine specimens of humanity. They did not want to
misunderstand me, but I had to pass nearly one hour and a half in my
attempt to explain to them that, in writing what I had written, I had
not written anything in a spirit of ill will or hatred towards
Englishmen. I was hard put to it to carry that conviction. In fact, I
do not know whether I carried that conviction to them at all. If salt
loseth  its savour, wherewith will it be salted? If I could not drive
home the truth that was in me to the three friends who certainly came
with open minds, how should I fare with others? It has often occurred
to me that  a seeker after truth has to be silent. I know the
wonderful efficacy of silence. I visited a Trappist monastery in
South Africa. A beautiful place it was. Most of the inmates of that
place were under a vow of silence. I enquired of the Father the
motive of it and he said that the motive was apparent. ‘We are
frail human beings. We do not know very often what we say. If we want
to listen to the still small voice that  is always speaking within
us, it will not be heard if we continually speak.’ I understood
that precious lesson. I know the secret of silence.  I do not know
just now as I speak to you whether it would not have been wise if I
had said nothing to those friends beyond saying, ‘We shall know
each other better when the mists have rolled away.’ As I speak to
you, I feel humiliated. Why did I argue with these  friends? But I
say these things to you, first of all, to make this confession and,
secondly, to tell you also that, if you will refuse to see</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the other side,  if	you  will  refuse  to  understand  what	India	is
thinking, then you will deny yourselves the real privilege of
service.</p>

I have told my missionary friends<font size="2">,</font>‘Noble as you
are, you have isolated yourselves from the people whom you want to
serve.’ I cannot help recalling to you the conversation I related
in Darjeeling at the Missionary Language School. Lord Salisbury was
waited upon by a deputation of missionaries in connection with China
and this deputation wanted protection. I cannot recall the exact
words, but give you the purport of the answer Lord Salisbury gave. He
said, “Gentlemen, if you want to go to China, to preach the message
of Christianity, then do not ask for assistance of temporal power. Go
with your lives in your hands and if the people of China want to kill
you, imagine that you have been killed in the service of God”. Lord
Salisbury was right. Christian missionaries come to India under the
shadow, or, if you like, under the protection of a temporal power,
and it creates an impassable bar.</p>

If you give me statistics that so many orphans have been reclaimed
and brought to the Christian faith, I would accept them, but  I do
not feel convinced thereby that it is your mission. In my opinion,
your mission is infinitely superior to that. You want to find men in
India and if you want to do that, you will have to go to the lowly
cottages not to give them something, might be to take something from
them. A true friend as I claim to be of the missionaries of India and
of the Europeans, I speak to you what I feel from the bottom of my
heart. I miss receptiveness, humility, willingness on your part to
identify yourselves with the masses of India. I have talked straight
from my heart. May it find a response from hearts.</p>

masses as I do, you will look upon this very simple instrument of
torture (here Mr. Gandhi produced the <i>takli </i>he carries with
him) with seriousness. You cannot present the hungry and famished
masses with God. Their God is their food. General Booth knew what he
was doing when at his numerous depots the first thing he did to the
hungry men and women who flocked there was to give them a plate of
soup. Before he would give them their next meal, he called upon them
to make splinters for his match factory, and then he introduced them
to God. The famished millions are famishing not because there is not
enough food produced in India, but because they have no work to do.
The only work for the millions is the spinning-wheel. I know the
Industrial Mission House in Calcutta. It is good in its way, but it
does not touch even the fringe of the question. The problem is how to
take work to the cottages of these men, cottages which are scattered
over a surface 1,900 miles long and 1,500 broad. They will not take
the spinning-wheel unless they learn the art themselves and unless
they spin to set an example to these men who have lost faith in
themselves and faith in everything and everybody. And the
spinning-wheel is useless unless you and I wear khaddar. Hence it is
that I have not hesitated to say to Lord Reading or to Lord
Willingdon that I will not be satisfied unless they and their
orderlies are dressed from top to toe in khaddar.</p>

ten lakhs on or before the 1st of July. In this we failed, but I
cannot say for want of effort. We failed for want of organization. It
is a fine tribute to the memory of Deshbandhu that we shall, before
this week is out, have collected six lakhs. It will have been fully
five weeks for the collection of six lakhs, and that gives an average
of a little less than a lakh and a quarter a week, or nearly
seventeen thousand per day.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Now, in spite of a little better though by no means a satisfactory
organization, we shall not be able to keep up the average as a
majority of large subscriptions have been collected. It is only on
the basis of past experience that the Memorial Committee has fixed
the  31st August as the very last date for receiving collections. It
is a long enough time for collecting what must be regarded as a
paltry sum for Bengal, and for a purpose so sacred as that of
perpetuating  the memory of Deshbandhu. The public will remember that
only three months were fixed for collecting one crore for the Tilak
Swaraj Fund. On the assumption that six lakhs will have been
collected before the end of this month, there will be thirtytwo days
left for collecting four lakhs. That leaves an average exactly of Rs.
12,500 per day. And if we are to secure the sum by the end of next
month, we must never fall below the average. And those who are
collecting and are concerned with the reputation of Bengal and with
the success of the Memorial will, I hope, make it a point of honour
to secure the daily average. I remind the principals of schools and
colleges all over Bengal of their duty. I know that the school-going
boys and girls are as eager as any to pay their mite. They simply
await the call. I know, too, that many zamindars who owe not a little
to Deshbandhu, have not yet sent in their subscriptions. May I
respectfully ask them to send them in unsolicited?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
Nor have all the ladies paid their quota. I have been told that they
merge in their husbands. I respectfully dissent from that view, I
want them to give, each one, their ornaments and pocket money as I
did at the time of collecting the Tilak Swaraj Fund. I ask them now
to part with what is their own without asking their partners to
replace them. Then there is no loss felt; only the pleasure of giving
remains. It is in that spirit that hundreds of sisters have already
paid. May I ask the remaining ones to copy that spirit if the memory
of Deshbandhu is a treasure for them and if a decently equipped
hospital for women and equally decent institution for training nurses
appeal to them as worthy objects?</p>

A magazine editor has sent me an article he has written on the
Prophet and which has given rise to an exciting meeting  in
Ahmedabad. He sends me also a copy of the <i>Khilafat </i>dated 29th
May.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
The article is not discourteous or abusive. I do not think that it
warrants all the excitement that it has given rise to. At the same
time it is an ignorant writing. The writer does not appear to me to
have read any good biography. Certainly, he has not read the Koran.
He has given an estimate of the life of the Prophet which we find in
the ordinary European reviews. The writer has asked for my opinion
and I have told him as much as I have told you. I would not have
worried you about this thing, had it not been for the number of
<i>Khilafat </i>that he has sent me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In my opinion, the <i>Khilafat </i>writer has unnecessarily excited
passion. I have read other portions of that number also out of
curiosity, and I must confess that I do not like the language or the
general tone of this particular number at all. “Fools, asses,
downright lying” and such choice epithets embellish its paragraphs.
I think you ought to control the language of the paper. I have not
read a single well-thought-out, decent paragraph. I am sure that the
writer does not even know that he has used unbecoming language.</p>

appreciate the viewpoint that he has placed before me and there was a
time when I could also say these things about loyalty. But as you
know, for the past six years I have not been speaking of loyalty, but
of disloyalty. It is not that I harbour disloyalty towards anything
whatsoever, but I do so against all untruth, all that is unjust, all
that is evil. This I want to make clear as I do not want to sail
under false colours. I remain loyal to an institution so long as that
institution conduces to my growth, to the growth of the nation.
Immediately I find that the institution instead of conducing to its
growth impedes it, I hold it to be my bounden duty to be disloyal to
it. I cannot for one moment say that I am loyal to the present
Government, that is, to the present system of Government. I assert
that  I am, every moment of my life, seeking to destroy this system
of Government which is sapping the manhood of India, which is sapping
its vitality and its resources, which is degrading alike those who
are in charge of the system and those who are governed by that
system.</p>

But I think that whilst we may agree to differ on this very
fundamental question, we must seek to find out whether there are not
many points of contact between you and me—between you and the vast
mass of the people who inhabit this beautiful land—if I may say
so—of ours. What the ultimate destiny of India will be we do not
know, or we know only this much that it is in our making, it will be
what everyone of us whose lot is cast in India wants it to be. But
beyond this we do not know, having no control over the minds of
millions of human beings who compose Hindustan. But everyone should
become an optimist and then there is nothing but the brightest future
for this land. That is, today, everyone should be able to say to
himself, “I live for this land. I shall die for this land.” I
want you, therefore, to approach the question in a spirit of service
and, when there is that spirit of service, we may erase that
disturbing factor. ‘Loyalty’ or ‘disloyalty’ does not matter
much when a person really wants to serve.</p>

My largest contact with the Anglo-Indians has been on the railway
trains, because they have somehow or other fought shy of the public
meetings, perhaps because of the notion that these meetings were
meetings of disloyalists. And as you have made loyalty your creed,
naturally these meetings have repelled you. On the trains, however, I
have sought you out.</p>

an instance of how the Anglo-Indians have isolated themselves from

some Anglo-Indian youngsters who travelled with him in the same train
from Ajmer. He had an occasion to listen to their profuse vocabulary
of slang until they recognized him, shed their naturalness and put on
manners. And the behaviour of even those boys afforded ample proof of
their isolation. One of them liked Indian sweets. But he dared not
purchase them when others saw him. “I eat the sweets only when no
one sees me,” he said. He was not an Indian, he thought, and did
not want to be observed by Indians. This, Mr. Gandhi said, was due to
their schooling.</font></font></p>

will have no status. Those of you who may possess a white skin may
deceive the Immigration Officer, but your relatives and sons may
betray you. That is the position. The colour bar is too terrible
there. You also will be counted among moral lepers. Mr. Malan now
says he would not drive us out, he would starve us out of South
Africa, and would practise hypocrisy double-distilled. The “bar
sinister”, as Lord Morley put it, applies to us even in England.

I do want to tell you at this critical moment of our national life,
“Anglo-Indians, make your choice with determination and courage,
whether you want to go away from the nation and whether you want to
live up to the style of Europeans.” Mind you, I am not asking you
to cut yourselves adrift from Englishmen. They are far more precious
to me today than they were before, because today I am leading the
natural life. There was a time when I was also aping the Europeans.
Little things guided my life then. But at a precious moment of my
life, I threw them into the Indian Ocean, and turned my back on them.
‘No more this life for me,’ I said, ‘no more shall I consent to
become the “blotting-sheet of civilization,” ’to use Sidgwick’s
picturesque phrase. Hence I have become more lovable, more
approachable. I had never before in my life so many friends in Europe
as I have today. That is because I have shed all unnaturalness. I may
be blunt, but bluntness is better than put-up courtesy. I would,
therefore, ask you to</p>

I have talked to you about your duty. You will naturally like to know
my duty. Well, if I became the Viceroy of India, which I think is
never coming to pass, I would simply give you and the other 
minorities the choice and ask you to take what you want. I would call
all the leaders of the parties and tell them my proposal. Then I
would call such of you as are numerically weakest to come first and
to ask what you want. In services I would insist on a decent
examination test, i.e., I would only ask a candidate, ‘How much of
a man or woman you are? Have you got the ability to rise to the
occasion?” Provided he or she passes these tests, I would select
first the one who belongs to the least numerical section. I would
thus give preference to all minorities along just lines, consistent
with the welfare of India. When I use this phrase, I assure you I am
not doing any verbal jugglery. It will be none of my object to see
that only Hindus can come in. Welfare of India as a whole, not of
Hindus and Mussalmans or of a particular community. I would not
flatter you or pamper you, but give you your due.</p>

presupposes a third party, but absolutely voluntary like the pact

Mussalmans at Delhi. So long as they had no faith in the justice of
the majorities, they must have this protection by a voluntary pact.
The parties to the pact were in honour bound to act according to the
pact. If they reduced it to a scrap of paper, they would do so at
their risk. To the Anglo-Indians he would say that, if the pact was
not respected, if sacred promises were not carried out, they could
have revenge on those who broke the pact. Concluding, Mr. Gandhi said

could not, even if I would, hand over the Congress to anyone. It only
means that every member can exercise his judgment in respect of the
alteration or otherwise of the franchise. The  Congress,  which  was
made at Belgaum a non-political organization, will now be converted
into a predominantly political institution, with the result that
political resolutions could be brought forward now, and the bar would
be removed from the path of those who could not enter the Congress as
a non-political body. It would not be a Swarajist body, it would be a
predominantly political body.  The Swarajists are, it is true,
predominant today, but that is because others have kept back, and if
they outnumber others, it will be because the others have no
organization. As regards obstruction, it may be wrong, it may be
right. But you surely do not expect to react on the Swarajists by
standing out of the Congress. Join the Congress in large numbers and
make them change their policy if you wish.</p>

I made a most innocent practical suggestion to the Government of
India. Deshbandhu Das had played the game, and you know how much at
heart he had the case of the political prisoners. I said to the
Government, ‘Will you perform one single graceful act which will
strike the imagination of the nation? Will you release the
prisoners?’ If that was done, it would have served a double
purpose. That would have taken the sting, if there was any, out of
these political prisoners, because they would have felt that they had
been released out  of  respect to the memory of Deshbandhu and they
could not commit a breach of trust reposed in them. And, then by this
act the Government would have gained a supreme moral victory, so that
they could have cleared the atmosphere for negotiations. But no. Lord
Birkenhead says he is prepared to consider anything that Indians
might have to suggest in order to allay animosities, but the
suggestion made is not practical. I tell you I have not the ingenuity
to make a more practical suggestion than what I have made. But it has
gone to the usual waste- paper basket. So if these little things
could not be had, what is the use of going on with the big
Commonwealth of India Bill? Mrs. Besant has a robust optimism and,
though on the wrong side of life like me, she thinks she must work
on.</p>

long, steady, selfless. He taught us to understand the poverty of the

Meetings we must have wherever the Congress flag flies. I would like

steps definitely forward towards our goal. Though a full

masses. His spirit lived in their midst, the swaraj of his dreams
included the economic amelioration of the masses. What can better
bring the classes nearer to the masses than the spinning-wheel and
khaddar? I would suggest raising of subscriptions at these meetings
for  the  Deshbandhu Charkha and Khaddar Memorial. The meetings may
also pass resolutions about hand-spinning and use of khaddar.
Wherever there is a surplus stock of khaddar, volunteers may dedicate
the day to hawking khaddar. From now those who have leisure may
utilize the whole of the day for spinning good yarn and presenting it
at these meetings for the nation.</p>

to their attention the method that we have adopted in India, that is
non-violence. Let the Chinese understand that they are numerically
the greatest nation on earth. They have  glorious traditions, they

of non-violence and truth, victory is not only certain but it is very
near. Surely a nation containing nearly four hundred million souls
need not be crushed under the weight of European and Japanese
ambition. China can free herself from foreign exploitation by purely
internal peaceful effort. If she succeeds in her boycott of foreign
goods, she removes the temptation in the way of foreign powers to

When the Congress has become a predominantly political body and if it
is still in some form to represent the masses, there must be a

solely upon hand-spinning and khaddar.</p>

concern, it must be a permanent body not in any shape or form

organization by taking the message of the spinning-wheel to the most
distant villages and, for the first time distributing wealth among
the villagers instead of draining it away from them. It will be a
peaceful penetration into the villages and an outflowing, after a
time, of real national life from them. It ought to be the mightiest
co-operative effort the world has yet seen. Given a fair amount of

impression is that I was so startled by the question as I understood
it that I had the friend to repeat it. However, even the question as
it now stands need not have been put, if the enquiring friend had
followed the proceedings of the Conference at Delhi and the tangible
scheme I put forth there. I swear by that scheme even now and feel
that we shall have to fall back upon it when we have regained sanity.
It is shortly this : There should be an electorate under a franchise
which would admit of all capable of understanding their
responsibilities being placed on the voters’ roll and which would
be true reflex of the proportion each community bears to the other in
point of numbers and that com- munal representation should be dealt
with outside the law. The proportion to be given to Mussalmans has
never worried me. The only thing I would like to guard against is a
statutory distinction.  I would not have the Government adjust the
proportion and provide for its working. However divided we may be
amongst ourselves, if we have the true national consciousness, we
must be able to approach the Government with one voice. For the
Government there should be neither Mussalman nor Hindu, Christian,
Sikh nor Parsi nor Brahmin nor non-Brahmin. For them we must all be
nationalists. This solution may not be acceptable, but it cannot be
said that I talk of love and unity but devise no tangible scheme. I
do not agitate now for its acceptance, because I have admitted that I
have lost influence over the vocal sections of both the communities.</p>

There are also several other charges mentioned in the foregoing
indictment. The complaint too had been received that the Congress
Committees in several parts of India have been using monies received
by them for purposes other than those for which  they  were

respective organi-zations and, wherever any corruption or
misappropriation is discovered, they will not hesitate to denounce
such corruption and remove it.</p>

A correspondent from Jamshedpur says that khaddar is  too costly for
the common or middle-class people; it does not last long; it gets
dirty too soon, and to keep it clean means an additional expenditure;
and adds, ‘Will you please explain in detail how it will be
possible for men like us to wear khaddar in these circumstances?’</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Although questions like these have been already answered in these
pages, it is not superfluous to revert to them again and again. Yard
for yard, at the present moment, khaddar is undoubtedly dearer than
mill-cloth. But my invariable experience is that those who have taken
to khaddar have, consciously or unconsciously, simplified their
dress. They do not require so much as when they used mill-cloth. Itis
not the experience of all that khaddar does not last as long as mill-
cloth. In the beginning stages the hand-spun yarn was ill-twisted.
Therefore, khaddar woven from such yarn was undoubtedly not durable.
But the quality has since improved. I suggest too that if khaddar is
washed at home, it will last twice as long as when it is sent to the
washermen. I admit that, if khaddar is sent out for washing, the cost
of washing khaddar would be greater than that of washing ordinary
calico. The only remedy is home-washing which need not frighten
people. Soaking khaddar overnight in hot water with soap enables one
to wash it perfectly clean in no time.</p>

When the correspondent says that it gets dirty all too soon, I
presume that he implies that being white it shows dirt. If the
intention be to conceal dirt the remedy is to colour it precisely in
the same manner that mill-cloth is coloured. And at the present
moment, plenty of coloured khaddar is available in the market. But
let me make the confession that khaddar cannot make headway if the
middle-class people compare it in price and everything else with
mill-made cloth. The incentive to use khaddar must be national for
the middle-class people, and they are expected to put themselves to
inconvenience in order to popularize it.</p>

If the State had belonged to the people, it would have protected

inconvenience and extra expenditure that its use may involve before
it becomes universal in India. Only five years ago, I sold very
coarse and ill-spun-and ill-woven khaddar at 17 as. per yard. Such
bad khaddar is now nowhere to be seen. Its evolution has been
phenomenal, so much so that much superior khaddar is today sold at
nine annas per yard in the same part of India. Every attempt is being
made to bring down the price of khaddar and, if the All-India
Deshbandhu Charkha Memorial becomes a success and the scheme that is
now being conceived comes into operation, I am expecting a still

Personally, I retain the same opinion that I did last year, that if
educated Indians concentrated on the triple constructive programme
and made it their predominant occupation, we should be  nearer
swaraj. But I confess that I have failed to carry that conviction
home. I must, therefore, no longer stand in the way of the Congress
being developed and guided by educated Indians rather than by one
like myself, who has thrown in his lot entirely with the masses, and
who has fundamental differences with the mind of educated India as a
body. I</p>

still want to act upon them, but not by leading the Congress; on the
contrary, by working my way to their hearts silently so far as
possible, even as I did between 1915 and 1919. I recognize the great
services rendered to the country by educated India in the face of
tremendous odds. It has got its own method of work; it has its own
place in the national life. I cannot be blind to the fact that, no
matter what may be said to the contrary, the disciplined resistance
of the Swaraj Party has made its impression upon the rulers. The best
way in which I can help that activity is by removing myself out of
the way and  by concentrating myself solely upon constructive work
with the help of the Congress and in its name and that, too, only so
far as educated Indians will permit me to do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I recognize that it is educated India which is to set the pace in the
Congress, not I and those who have ceased to think politically for
the time being. In my opinion, both have a place in the national
evolution. And each group  remaining in its own sphere can complement
and help the activity of the other. I pin my faith to the
spinning-wheel and khaddar. It is a programme which can absorb the
energies of the most advanced youths of the country. It is an effort
which demands the exclusive attention, not of one man, but of
hundreds, indeed thousands, of men and women. I do not want to engage
in disputations about the necessity or the utility of the
spinning-wheel and khaddar. Time has come for working out the
propositions I have advanced in behalf of khaddar, and in working
them out I want the goodwill and co-operation of all who will extend
them to the movement, and this is possible only by removing the
spinning-wheel from the arena of Congress politics. The spinning-
wheel and khaddar will, therefore, retain that place in the Congress
which may be freely given to them by the politically-minded
countrymen. If my advice is, therefore, accepted by the All-India
Congress Committee, the ban upon political propaganda through the
Congress will be entirely removed, and the Swaraj Party will,
therefore, then function not through its separate organization, but
through the Congress itself, not by virtue of any new pact but by
reason of the dissolution of the pact existing between the Party and
myself, and consequent amendment of the Congress constitution and of
the Congress resolution that gave effect to the pact. The pact threw
the door open to the other political parties by suspending non-co-
operation. Its dissolution will make the opening wider still inasmuch
as the politically-minded people of the country will no longer labour</p>

under the handicap of the Congress being confined merely to the
constructive programme. They had some hesitation in joining the
Swaraj Party, and in their opinion, the Congress did not afford
sufficient scope for their energies and talents. But when the ban is
removed, they can, if they will, whole-heartedly join the Congress
and move any political resolutions that they may desire from the
Congress platform, and cross swords with the Swarajists and so act
upon them and the country.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
The compulsory yarn franchise will no longer hamper them. The only
impediment in their way will be the compulsory adoption of khaddar as
national wear. But it may be that the All-India Congress Committee
will reject even khaddar as part of the franchise. I shall not stand
in the way even of such rejection, painful though it will certainly
be to me; for, in my opinion, then educated India will cut off the
only visible and tangible tie that today binds it to the masses. I
shall hope, therefore, that khaddar will find a permanent place in
the Congress franchise. Do we not want to encourage cottage
industries and handicrafts? Do we not want millions of women who have
no work to do, and who will gladly earn a few pice per day, to do so
by spinning? Hand-spinning, I understand, is to be retained as a
permanent part of the franchise as an alternative. To that I should
think there can be no objection. If, therefore, the proposals that I
have made are accepted by the All-India Congress Committee, it will
become possible for every educated Indian to join the Congress and
evolve a united national political programme that will meet the
emer-gency that has arisen both by Deshbandhu’s death and Lord
Birkenhead’s speech.</p>

Whilst I was discussing with friends the object of the All-India
Deshbandhu Memorial, certain friends asked, “Why should not the
maintenance of dependents of those who are in prison or deported and
alleviation of unemployment of Congressmen who are starving by reason
of their non-co-operation be one of the objects, if not the object?”
The same question has come before me during my stay in Bengal in a
variety of ways. In my opinion, it is not possible to raise the fund
suggested from all over India and from all parties for such a
purpose. So far as the maintenance of the dependents of political
prisoners and detenues is concerned, it is a matter that requires
most</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
delicate handling and must be left to each province to settle in the
manner that may be considered most suitable in that  province. I
cannot reconcile myself to a permanent fund for that object. My own
practical experience in South Africa, and to a limited extent here,
has shown me that very often undeserving people get relief and the
deserving are left out. A permanent fund for distant contingencies of
this nature offers temptation to those who do not mind living on
charity. In order to obviate chances of dishonest practices, I had to
establish a settlement in South Africa where all those who needed and
deserved relief could be accommodated, fed, and looked after. At a
single stroke it was possible by this arrangement to save thousands
of rupees, to provide for every honest case of distress, to do
absolute justice to everyone, to put people in distress in ideal
surroundings, to find use- ful employment for them and to provide
education for the children of such families. I suggested a similar
course in Chittagong after the great strike in 1921. There is danger
of charity being misplaced unless drastic measures as I have
suggested be adopted to deal with cases of political imprisonment or
detention. The real fight, if it is to come at all on a large scale,
is still to come. We shall have to pay a price adequate to the
freedom we want and, unless we think out and devise some plan of
meeting such contingencies in a reaso- nable manner, in the struggle
for freedom, it is possible for us to be starved into an ignominious
surrender. Apart, therefore, from the question of Memorial and on the
merits of the case, I am against any permanent fund for the relief of
what may be called political distress.</p>

The question of the Congress unemployed is more urgent and of a
permanent character. Although we have resolutions on  the  subject,
hitherto we have been unable to establish an All-India Congress
Service or even a Provincial Congress Service, not for want of will
but for want of ability. Personally, I have endeavoured to tackle it
more than once, but I own I have been baffled. It has not been
possible to fix a maximum to be paid nor has it been possible to
devise grades of service. Wherever, therefore, it has been sought to
establish a system, it has been found necessary to leave well alone
and try every case on its merits. It is perhaps not possible as  yet 
to establish a regular service, but I have no doubt that the scale
and the system are gradually growing.</p>

There are two branches of constructive activity which absorb the
largest number of Congress workers,—khaddar and, to a lesser

responsible</p>

for its own scheme and as it too depends, as a rule, upon local
contributions, it is a fairly sound proposition that that Service
only deserves to live which obtains local support, because the test
of appreciation of service is the support given by those who are
served. The very existence of the Congress depends upon the fact that
it supplies a local want. It is not like a Government super-imposed
and, therefore, independent of the support of those whom it seeks to
rule. Both the khaddar and the educational services presuppose
continued activity and continued preparation. I have laid it down as
a rule for my own guidance that, if neither of these activities has
local support, it is due to want of tact or ability on the part of
those who are engaged in the respective services. I do not know a
single case of starvation of deserving men. I know cases of
straitened circumstances of Congress workers eking out an honest but
precarious life. But I fear that that will be progressively our lot,
and, if in some cases, some of us have not yet reconciled ourselves
to the simplicity and severity  that  have entered into the national
life, and if some owing to a long course of habit are even
constitutionally unfitted to adopt themselves to the severe
simplicity which is expected of them, in any case I hope it is now
clear why the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial may not take the form of
giving relief to the distressed or finding employment for Congress
workers. The present object of the Memorial is calculated indirectly
to do both.</p>

The Maulana certainly never conveyed to me directly or indirectly,
that his recommendation of Mr. J. M. Sen Gupta’s name was based
upon the fact that there was no honest and able Mussalman in the
Corporation or outside on whom the distinction could be conferred,
but simply suggested a political motive for his recommendation,
namely giving as much adventitious aid as possible to the Swaraj
Party in the absence of its illustrious Chief. Whatever the
interpretation that my speech, as reported, may be capable of, the
public will accept my assurance that nothing was more remote from my
mind, or that of Maulana Sahib than to think that there was no honest
and able Mussalman who could be recommended for the honour. In fact,
for me, it would be ludicrous presumption, when I did not
sufficiently know any Mussalman in Calcutta except the Maulana, to
say that there was no honest and able Mussalman who could occupy the
chair. Indeed, if the Maulana Sahib’s suggestion had not come to me
or, having come, had not appealed to me, I would have continued to
prosecute Mr. Suhrawardy’s claim as I had come to know something of
his ability, and I was entitled to presume his honesty from his
occupation of the chair of the Deputy Mayor.</p>

You will perhaps extend me the courtesy of finding room for a reply
to your article headed “Civil Resistance” in today’s <i>Statesman</i>.
You see an inconsistency between my desire to prepare an atmosphere
for civil resistance and my statement to the European Association
that  I was dying for co-operation. My speech before the European
Association was delivered on July 24. I write for <i>Young India </i>on
Saturday for the issue of Thursday following. The reference to civil
resistance which you have quoted appears in <i>Young India </i>of 
July 23. I give you the dates in order to show that the idea or
preparation for civil resistance was not conceived after the
statement to the European Association.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.06cm">I

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
for co-operation. You will remember that my statement to the European
Association was a recalling of an old story. When, in the heyday of
non-co-operation, an Englishman twitted me with  the remark that,
although I professed non-co-operation I was dying to co- operate, I
said to him emphatically that I was doing so. And I say that that is
my position also today. Civil resistance to wrong in not a new
doctrine or practice with me. It is a life-long belief and a
life-long practice. To prepare the country for civil resistance is to
prepare it for non-violence. To prepare the country for non-violence
is to organize it for constructive work which, to me, is synonymous
with the spinning-wheel. You evidently seem to think that I have
repented of my non-co-operation or civil resis-tance. I have never
done so. I remain a confirmed non-co-operator. If I could carry
educated India with me, I would declare non-co-operation in its
entirety today. Being a practical man, I recognize the facts that
stare me in the face. I have failed to convince some of my most
esteemed colleagues that the particular form of non-co-operation
which we embarked upon  in  1920 can do good to the country at the
present moment. It, therefore, remains under suspension. But I cannot
hide from you the fact that, if I could reconvert my colleagues, I
would certainly ask the Congress to renew the battle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Personally, I have no desire to co-operate voluntarily with the
Government in my weakness; that would be the co-operation of a slave.
I admit my weakness, and, therefore, I remain satisfied with the mere
desire for co-operation and I seek to fulfil that desire by
developing strength. If I believed in violence, I would make no
secret of it and would take the consequences. But I would let the
country know publicly, and know in unequivocal terms, that there is
no  freedom for her and no room for honourable co-operation with the
Government, unless she is prepared to match the British bayonet with
the Indian. As it is, I do not believe in the creed of the bayonet. I
further believe that, fortunately or unfortunately, it will never
succeed in India. A substitute for it is, however, necessary and that
is civil resistance.In your opinion it is as dangerous as violence,
and if such is also the opinion of the Government, it has to suppress
me, for after my discharge from prison, I have not allowed a moment
to pass when  I have not endeavoured to fit myself or the country 
for  civil  resistance. Let me inform you in all humility that, if I
could but secure the absolute co-operation of my revolutionary
friends by the entirecessation of their activity, and if I could
produce an atmosphere</p>

of general non-violence, I would declare mass civil resistance today
and thus prepare the ground for honourable co-operation. I admit that
I failed to do so in 1921, and when I found that Chauri Chaura
betrayed me, I had no hesitation within twenty-four hours of the
declaration of civil resistance to suspend it, and to take the
consequences of a general depression in the country that followed.</p>

And if I insist <i>ad nauseam </i>on Hindu-Muslim unity, and the
spinning-wheel and khaddar, it is in order to ensure a state of non-
violence necessary for civil resistance. I have, I confess, despaired
of achieving Hindu-Muslim unity in the very near future.
Untouchability is surely but slowly going, the spinning-wheel is
surely but slowly making its way. Meanwhile, the ruthless
exploitation of the country is proceeding apace. I am, therefore,
thinking out plans of some form of effective individual civil
resistance which, if it brings no relief to this poor country, will
at least bring some solace to those whose creed is non-violence, to
know that they have left no stone unturned to help the deliverance of
the country from a bondage which is enervating a whole nation.</p>

I confess, again that I have no ready-made plan, for if I had, I
would not keep it from you or the country. But I am giving you the
whole of the working of my mind. I have no desire to obtain or retain
the goodwill of Englishmen under false pretences. Even as the
Government abates no precaution or preparation for ensuring its
existence and stability, when it may be offering terms to Indian
politicians, even so do I want my country to abate no effort to arm
itself with a weapon on which she may rely when the Government fails
to respond to its wishes.</p>

You may know (for the communication is published) that Deshbandhu did
not sign Dr. Besant’s manifesto on her Bill, one of the grounds for
which was that there was no sanction stipulated for in the event of
rejection. That sanction was to be civil resistance. Will you have
the country’s manhood absolutely paralysed and  rendered utterly
ineffective for any resistance, violent or non-violent, before the
British Government can possibly think of offering any terms or
considering proposals that might be made by the Swaraj Party or any
other? If so, I assure you, no self-respecting Indian will
voluntarily be party to a condition so degrading.</p>

Gandhi, who presided, said that two things were dear to the heart of
the deceased patriot, one of which was that he stood, without any
mental reservation, out and out for Hindu-Muslim unity. He was also
an ardent advocate of swadeshi. The times when Rasul lived were
comparatively ancient, and he wished to interpret his message in the
spirit of modern times. In the programme that was sketched out for
the nation in 1920, both Hindu-Muslim unity and swadeshi were duly
emphasized. But they gave a new meaning to both these two things.
They then decided that it was not enough that a few educated Indians
should stand shoulder to shoulder, work together, perhaps mix
socia-lly also. They then felt the necessity of taking that message
to the masses. They had not half done the task. In fact, they had not
yet made a beginning. They all wanted Hindu-Muslim unity, but they
would not get it by simply talking about it. Then and then only would
Hindu-Muslim unity be established when Hindus would learn to serve
the Mohammedans without expecting the slightest reward and
Mohammedans would learn to serve Hindus in a similarly disinterested
spirit. The new meaning of swadeshi was, not that they should put
together the several parts of an article, say a watch or harmonium,
imported from abroad and label it as swadeshi, but their swadeshi now
consisted in every part being made in India. They now recognized that
the central fact round which swadeshi should revolve was “khaddar”.
That was the modern dictionary meaning of swadeshi and not until they
had done this one thing would they be able to realize the dream that
Abdur Rasul dreamt.</font></font></p>

why millions of people of India were idling away their time? Indians
were not a nation of idlers. Had they been so, they would have died
long ago. The fact was that there was not enough work for them and
therefore this glorious land of theirs, because of their ignorance,
because of their want of real patriotism, was throwing out people who

	It was a pleasure to meet you and have that little discussion, and
	an equal pleasure to have received your letter.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
	</font></sup>What I said at the meeting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
	</font></sup>was based upon recent experiences.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
	I know that individual instances of a broader  and  truer outlook
	upon religions are on the increase. The tolerance  with  which I was
	listened to at that meeting is a proof of it. But the literature
	that was sent me by unknown friends in the jail and the letters that
	I received almost every month from Christian friends, both in India
	and outside, demonstrate the truth of my remarks. As to Bishop
	Heber’s Hymn<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3</font></sup>,
	you will realize, perhaps, that it is one thing for a man to think
	of himself as vile and unclean, but it is another for the world to
	pronounce him as such.  Augustine  considered himself as chief among
	sinners. The world calls him a saint. Tulsidas had no adjective
	harsh enough to describe himself as a sinner. The world regards him
	also as a saint. Lastly, I wonder if you know that the Christian
	Literature Society continues to sell the  utterly  unbalanced views
	and opinions of Mr. Murdoch and others. And if you only knew the
	literature in the vernaculars that is distributed through tens of
	thousands of leaflets and booklets, you will, perhaps, appreciate
	the force of my remarks. These things hurt  me  only because I know
	that they believe the teachings of Jesus, in whose name they are
	said and written; and it hurts me also because Indian Christians are
	fed upon such ignorance which they, in their simplicity, imbibe as
	God’s truth, and hence learn to hate those who were once their
	friends, companions and relatives. You perhaps do not know that I
	mix as freely with Christian Indians in the lower strata of society
	as I mix with a similar class of Hindus and Mussalmans. I say these
	things</p>

	I have your letter. A man who owns land which is haunted by wild
	beasts will be able to excuse himself for shooting them. It would be
	classed as inevitable <i>himsa</i>. It will be justified on the
	ground of necessity, but there is no doubt that, if one has a full
	perception of ahimsa, it would be well for him to let his land be
	overrun by wild beasts or be himself killed by them. Ahimsa is not a
	mechanical matter, it is personal to everyone. Moreover, possession
	of property against the whole world is inconsistent with ahimsa. A
	man who will follow the principle of non-violence to its uttermost
	limit has nothing in this world he can call his own. He must merge
	himself into the whole, which includes snakes, scorpions, tigers,
	wolves, etc. There are instances on record of innocent men whose
	innocence  even  wild beasts have recognized. We must all strive to
	reach that stage.</p>

	The same remark  applies  to your second question.  It is <i>himsa 
	</i>to kill the germs and the insects, but even as we commit <i>himsa
	</i>by taking vegetable food (for vegetables have life) but regard
	it as inevitable, so must we treat the germ life. You will recognize
	that the doctrine of necessity can be stretched so as to justify
	even man-eating. A man who believes in ahimsa carefully refrains
	from every act that leads to injury. [My] argument only applies to
	those who believe in ahimsa. The necessity that I have in mind is a
	universal necessity, hence it is not permissible to take ahimsa
	beyond a limit. That is why the Shastras of custom only permit <i>himsa
	</i>in certain cases. It is not only lawful but obligatory upon
	everyone to make the least use possible of the permission and
	relaxation. It is unlawful to go beyond the limitation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

such new rituals as they found appropriate. <i>Kirtans </i>were held

Not using the bullock for ploughing or drawing water indicates
kindness to animals. Except during the monsoon, we are  almost always
callously engaged in drawing water and so on. Actually, this does
more harm than good. People have lost nothing but have rather gained
something where it is customary to give a weekly day of rest to
servants and animals; hence it is a good beginning to stop drawing
water with the leather bucket and thereby giving rest to servants and
animals on such occasions of mourning for great men.</p>

Giving sweetmeat balls to dogs and cows, however, is misplaced
kindness. There is no reason to believe that just because we like
these sweets, cows and dogs also like them and are benefited by
eating them. Animals have not had their taste for food spoilt. If
even among human beings the taste for food varies, what can we say of
animals? An Englishman, if given a sweetmeat ball, would throw it
away. Many  of us would not like English sweets. If anyone served a
meal of <i>rotis  </i>in Madras, our countrymen there would be unable
to eat it. It is useless to serve a meal of rice in the Punjab. What
then is the meaning of serving such sweets to cows and dogs? The fact
that dogs eat these up is no argument in support of feeding them with
these sweets. It is kindness to give grass to undernourished cattle.
In villages, however there should be no such cattle. There is no
kindness in giving such food to dogs; I see only ignorance in it. We
are exchanging wakefulness for sleep. We increase their progeny by
tempting dogs in an improper way and, then, since no one owns them,
they remain undernourished. All dogs should be kept as pets. The
existence of stray dogs is a sign of our sin and our ignorance.

kindness only in name doubles the amount of cruelty and violence.
Violence is involved, first, in catching these dogs and driving them
away from familiar surroundings and second, in releasing them in
other poor villages. For the nuisance of stray dogs, civilized human
beings should seek out a solution on a consideration of both ethics
and expediency. Such tasks can be accomplished only if the <i>mahajans</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

dogs under the supervision of someone who is an expert in the matter.</p>

Last week I had been to Suri. As I am regarded as a servant of the
poor, the <i>mahajans </i>of that place fed the poor in my honour.
Their meal was fixed for the same time as that of the arrival of my
train. I was taken in a car which passed between rows of poor people
sitting down for their meal on either side of the road. I felt
ashamed and, had I not been afraid of being discourteous, I would
have got down then and there and run away. What kind of an arrogant
servant of the poor was this who rode in comfort in a car between
rows of people eating? I said a few words about this in the meeting
at Suri. I saw a similar sight in an ancient wealthy family in
Calcutta. I had been taken there in order to collect funds for the
memorial to Deshbandhu. The palace of this faimly is known as the
‘Marble Palace’ and it is indeed made exclusively of marble. The
building is a majestic one and well worth seeing. In front of this
palace, the poor are always fed. They are given cooked cereals. The
owners had asked me to come at the very time when these people are
fed with the innocent purpose of demonstrating their generosity to me
and with the good intention of pleasing me. I had agreed to go
without giving any thought to the matter. However, I was even more

not taken in a car between rows of diners but, wherever I went, a
whole crowd always followed me. This crowd rushed towards me from in
between the people who were having their meal. The poor diners
necessarily came into contact with the feet of these people. For a
moment they even stopped eating. If in their souls they had blessed
me, I would congratulate them on their restraint and generosity. What
 a contrast between that dusty courtyard and the tall,  snow-white
palace! I felt as if the palace laughed at those poor people and as

this laughter.</p>

Could there by any merit in feeding people in this manner? To me, it
appeared to be a mere sin committed through thought- lessness and
ignorance, even though the sentiment behind it may be of the purest
nature. Such  <i>sadavartas</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>are
 to  be  found  at  various places in the country. These add to our
poverty, idleness, hypocrisy, theft, etc. This is because, if food is
available without effort, those who are habitually lazy remain idle
and become poorer. According to the saying that Satan  finds  some 
mischief  still  for idle hands to  do, these poor people learn to
steal. Over and above this, they practise other vices which are
harmful to them. I see only evil resulting from these <i>sadavartas</i>.
The wealthy should give some thought to the free meals they serve in
charity. It is not necessary to show that merit does not lie in all
charity. <i>Sadavarta </i>is indeed to be commended for the lame, the
crippled and those who are disabled by disease. Even when feeding
these persons, however, some courtesy should  be  shown.  Even the
disabled should not be fed with thousands of people watching them.
There should be a proper place, private and quiet, for feeding them.
In fact, there should be special ashramas for them. There are a few
such places scattered over India. Wealthy persons who wish to feed
the disabled should either send their donations to such good ashramas
or establish them at places where they do not exist and are needed.</p>

In the first place, the fact is that I have merely stated my views. I

Taking it for granted, however, that all the members will accept my

resolution, the ban that existed on introducing political matters
into the Congress will henceforth be lifted. If my advice is

because of the Congress resolution will no longer have to do so. What
is it that can be done by me alone and that I should do myself,
becauseof the death of Deshbandhu and in reply to Lord Birkenhead’s
speech? It was my own idea that political matters should be kept out
of the Congress for the time being. The pact too was between myself
and the Swarajists. I alone can free them from this bond immediately.
The Congress Committee is free to act as it chooses. If a sizable
number of the members of that committee are opposed to my advice, I

The doors of the Congress cannot be forcibly closed against anyone.
So long as we cannot create faith in khadi and the power of the
spinning-wheel amongst the educated class, the latter can never
attain a place of importance. It is, I think, a barren gesture to
give the spinning-wheel an important place for fear of embarrassing
me or in order to keep me in the Congress. It would have significance
only if the educated class has faith in it or if this class wishes to
give prominence to those who believe in it. Even at a meeting of the
members of the Swaraj Party, no one ever thought of displacing the
spinning-wheel. Even if they had wished to do so, I was ready to
agree to it, but they were not prepared to listen to any talk even
about doing so. They were wholly satisfied if those who did not spin
were allowed to contribute money instead. They are not even prepared
to do away with the necessity of putting on khadi clothes. If this is
the extent to which the Swarajists think independently, I would
regard it as promoting effectively the cause of kahdi.</p>

The very terms Swarajists and No-changers should be given up. The
number of persons going into Legislative Assemblies will always be
small. Everyone cannot go there. I do not see any reason for opposing
this. If the very people who enter them can create the atmosphere for
civil disobedience, they will come out of their own accord or give
all possible help while continuing to remain in the Legislative
Assemblies. Or, they will have to be opposed if and when they offer
resistance to civil disobedience. That the Swarajists would do so I
cannot imagine.</p>

Those who understand the meaning of civil disobedience will sing the
praises of the spinning-wheel all the twenty-four hours; hence my
suggestion is that the latter should be given the same standing that
the Swarajists occupy today or, in other words, an association for
the spinning-wheel should be founded  under the auspices of the 
Congress, whose only task would be to spread the use of the spinning-
wheel and khadi. That association should also collect the yarn
stipulated as a condition for the right to vote and should keep that
yarn with itself. It should frame its own independent constitution.
If work is carried on in this way, the two movements would continue
to function without coming into clash with each other, but assisting
each other.</p>

The centenary of Dadabhai Naoroji’s birth falls on the ensuing 4th
September. Shri Bharucha has given us a timely reminder of this. We
knew Dadabhai as the Grand Old Man of India. He dedicated his life to
the country. He made the service of the country our dharma. He was
the friend of the poor of our land. It was he  who  first presented
the picture of the poverty of India. To this day, no one has been
able to contradict the statistics he furnished. He made no
distinction between Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, Christians and others.
He regarded them all as the children of Mother India and hence all
received equal service from him. His two grand-daughters have, we
find, inherited in full measure this trait.</p>

How shall we celebrate the centenary of this great servant of India?
We shall, of course, hold meetings and that too not only in cities,
but also in all villages to which the voice of the Congress can be
carried. And what shall we do there? Praise Dadabhai? If this is all
that we wish to do, why should we not sit comfortably, send for bards
and minstrels and call upon them to employ their imagination and
their torrential flow of words? If, however, we wish to emulate his
virtues, we should think of them and take stock of our capacity to
acquire them.</p>

Dadabhai saw the poverty of India. He taught us that swaraj is the
remedy for it. However, he left to us the task of seeking out the key
to swaraj. The principal reason for exalting Dadabhai was his
devotion to the country and he spent himself in it.</p>

We know that the spinning-wheel is the chief means of winning swaraj.
India’s poverty is due to its peasants remaining idle for four to
six months in a year. And, if this enforced idleness becomes a
voluntary one, or in other words, we become habitually lazy, not only
will this country not gain its freedom, but it will perish
altogether. The spinning-wheel is the only way of getting rid of this
idleness. Hence, all activities which encourage its use amount to an
imitation of Dadabhai’s virtues.</p>

However, what of those who do not like to utter the word

suggestion is for the people at large. It cannot be anything but
this. It is a different matter altogether if someone searches for
other virtues in Dadabhai and tries to imitate them. He has a right
to celebrate this centenary in a different way. Or, if members of the
Swaraj Party wish to do something special in cities, they should
certainly do so. I can only refer to that which can be practised
alike by villagers and city-dwellers, old men as well as children,
women as well as men, Hindus as well as Muslims.</p>

using the spinning-wheel today in view of that programme. We should
start today producing khadi for that occasion and hold meetings at

and khadi, or who believe that these should have no place in the
memorial, are not at all urged to sign this appeal. Not only was
there an insistence to get signatures from those who have faith, but
the decision had also been taken that the memorial should not  be
associated with the spinning-wheel and khadi if those who were
particular followers of Deshbandhu did not approve of the idea.  Such
 a memorial was not to be insisted upon if all those whom we would
ordinarily expect to sign this appeal did not unhesitatingly do so. I
know that there is a difference of opinion as regards the usefulness 
of the spinning-wheel and khadi. To give it the place of prime
importance in the memorial of a great leader like Deshbandhu would
not perhaps be readily acceptable to many people. I, however, had to
carry out my duty as the friend and colleague of Deshbandhu and, if I
had to think separately in terms of an all-Bengal Memorial, I would
certainly not have approved of a hospital. I have never recognized
the need for a large number of hospitals. However, I have not even
let the thought enter my mind as to what I would do if I had the
freedom to decide. I had before me the trust-deed made out by
Deshbandhu. It clearly showed me the path I had to take and I
regarded it as my duty to make it the heart of the memorial if it met
with the approval of his followers and I have now stayed on in Bengal
for the sole purpose of collecting Rs. 10 lakhs for it. The
trust-deed was made out a year ago. Nevertheless, I know that
Deshbandhu continued to hold until his death the views expressed in
it. This is because he had asked me to help collect money to pay off
the  mortgage on the building. It could be said that except me,
perhaps, no one but his wife knows his views on the spinning-wheel
and khadi towards the end of his life. I had acquainted myself with
the views of Shrimati Basanti Devi before issuing this circular.
Similarly I had acquainted myself with the views of Deshbandhu’s
close friend and partner, Pandit Motilalji, and, later, those of his
particular followers in Bengal. Only after having done so did I
decide to draft the circular. I must admit this much that the work of
this memorial is very close to my heart. Even though this is true,
the reader must believe me when I say that I am unconcerned about its
success. But this could not be said about the all-Bengal memorial. I
am making ceaseless efforts to make a success of it. There are
reasons for such a discrimination. My faith in the power of the
spinning-wheel is inexhaustible despite the difference of opinion in
this matter. Such a memorial cannot be established with limited
resources. I would like to have an</p>

In Calcutta, I was taken to a gathering of our Marwari brothers.
Matters relating to reforms in the caste alone were taken up and
discussed. What kind of speech could I make at such a place? Instead 
of talking of reforms, I mainly put before them the principle of
boycott. I was aware that the ostracism had taken on a terrible form
amongst these people with the result that there was bitterness
amongst them.  I give here the substance of my speech,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

The weapon of boycott is well used only by those individuals who are
pure. Otherwise, it would take the form of pure violence and perhaps
lead to the destruction of the one who uses it and even of the one
against whom it is used.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Today, we are not worthy of practising boycott. Could there be any
merit in treating as an outcaste a father who arranges for the
remarriage of his daughther widowed at the age of ten and extending
the same treatment to the daughter as well as the person who marries
her? Do we boycott persons who are immoral, and openly licentious and
who partake of meat and wine? What of those who are guilty of
licentious thoughts? In other words, so long as we are not purified,
who is fit to boycott whom? None of us is fit to do so.</p>

While praising the generosity of our Marwari brothers, I have
suggested the need for discrimination in practising this  virtue.
Carnegie became a multi-millionaire. He was fond of establishing
libraries indiscriminately; hence Scottish professors warned him tobe
careful and suggested that it would be proper on his part to announce
donations after consulting experts. Such advice is needed by all
philanthropists and should be noted by them. There is no reason to
believe that charity <i>per </i><i>se </i>is meritorious. Our Marwari
brothers are true protectors of the cow. Much of their wealth they
use in that work. However, this is not always done with
discrimination. If anyone can protect the cow, the Marwaris can, for
they have courage. It is mainly a question of funds and business
acumen. They possess both these requirements. If these are used with
discretion, they can truly bring about cow-protection on a large
scale.</p>

<i>CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE IN THE CONGRESS</i></h1>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.22cm; line-height: 102%">
We have, very often, said in the <i>Navajivan </i>that civil
disobedience may be practised not only towards those whom we regard
as our enemies or those who regard us as enemies, but also towards
those whom we regard as our friends or our elders. It is now time to
apply this to the Congress. The constitutional changes which it is
necessary to bring about are stated elsewhere in this issue.
Ordinarily, however, the Congress Committee is not authorized to make
these changes. They can be made only by amending the constitution.
The Congress alone is authorized to amend it. This power is not
vested in the  Congress Committee. The latter would have to make use
of its extraordinary powers in order to do so. The use of such powers
may also be called “civil disobedience” of the law. Not only has
every person and every organization the right to practise this if
occasion arises, but it may become even their duty to do so. If we
recognize the necessity of the reforms suggested by me, this is now
our duty. This matter should certainly be discussed at the Congress
session. The rule which permits the purchase of yarn to be
contributed must be annulled because, not only has spinning gained
nothing by it but, on the contrary it has led to an increase in
hypocrisy and falsehood. If the Congress Committee does not make this
necessary change, it may be regarded as having failed in its duty,
because the public will be wasting a few months. Perhaps, there would
have been room for difference of opinion on this subject if
Deshbandhu had not died and if Lord Birkenhead had not made his
speech; but there is no such room left now. It may be that some
members of the Congress Committee do not accept the immediate
necessity of making the change; in that case, they have no right to
practise civil disobedience and, hence, I have stated that the
Congress Committee can make such changes only by near, if not
complete, unanimity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
The necessity of making such changes is not a sufficient ground for
offering civil disobedience. Those against whom it is offered must
also be benefited by it. This condition is wholly fulfilled in this
case as the above changes are necessary only for the benefit of  the
Congress. The second condition is that those who practise such
disobedience must bear no ill will. This is implied in its very name,
as ‘civility’ is opposed to ill will. Moreover, how can there be
any ill will when we only wish the Congess well? My purpose in
writing this article is not to make anyone declare against his wishes
that the</p>

constitution should indeed be changed. In this matter, too, all
concerned should make use of their independent judgment. Those, too,
who feel that changing the constitution in this manner by the
Congress Committee would result in greater harm than good, they too
should in duty oppose these changes being made by the Congress
Committee, although they may accept the necessity for making them.
Civil disobedience cannot—it should not—be practised because
someone else asks us to do so. It should be practised only when it
seems appropriate to us; then alone is it worth the name, then alone
it is worth practising. This is because human beings do not have
strength to do a thing about which they are themselves not convinced,
and civil disobedience relies for its success solely on the strength
of the individual.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The chief purpose of writing this article is to describe the
circumstances in which civil disobedience may be practised. I regard
myself as an expert on the subject, I regard it as my own independent
discovery and, I look upon it as my dharma to show from time to time
its applicability and its limitations. Not only am I totally
unconcerned whether the changes are made or not but I regard them as
harmful if everyone does not exercise his independent judgment. This
criticism applies particularly to those who regard themselves as my
followers. I do not approve of blind worship. I am very much opposed
to it. Swaraj cannot be secured by it and, if secured, cannot be
maintained. Hence I would like to get work out of my ‘followers’
so as to utilize also their intelligence. If we make the above
changes intelligently and honestly practise them, I expect very good
results to follow.</p>

You, Sir, have just said that probably this is for the first time I
am privileged to address a meeting of Indian Christians only. If you
refer to my present visit, you are perfectly correct. But if you
refer or have referred to the whole of the time that I have been in
India since my return from South Africa, then I have to inform you
that I had such a privilege in 1915.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>But
my connection with Indian Christians dates back to 1893. That was the
time when I went to South Africa and found myself in the midst of a
large Christian Indian community. I was agreeably surprised to find
so many young men and young women who, whilst they were devoted
Christians, were equally devoted to the motherland, and it gave me
greater pleasure when I discovered that most of the young men and
young women had never seen India. The majority of them were born in
Natal; some of them in Mauritius, because it was from Mauritius that
the first batch of free Indian settlers</p>

found their way to South Africa. They were most of them children of
indentured parents. Indentured Indians were those who had gone to
work on the sugar estates of Natal under an indissoluble contract to
work on those estates for at least five years and as they had gone
under this contract, otherwise called indenture, they were called
Indentured Indians. Their state was described during his lifetime by
the late Sir William Hunter as a state very near to slavery. I have
mentioned this in order to show to you under what difficulties and
disabilities these countrymen and countrywomen of ours laboured in
South Africa and how they were able to overcome those difficulties,
and, in the face of them, cut out for themselves honourable careers.
Today, some of these men have even received a liberal education in
England. Some of them are store-keepers, some of them occupying
humbler walks of life. These brave lads offered their services to the
Government at the time of the Boer War and the Zulu Rebellion. Some
of them were brought up in my own home; two of them at least became
barristers. So you understand what  intimate  relations  I enjoyed
with the Christian Indian community. I do not think there is in that
land a single Indian Christian whom I do not know or who does not
know me. It gives me, therefore, much pleasure to be able to come
before you this evening to speak to you on “Brotherhood of Man”.</p>

It goes hard with people who have to suffer the disabilities that our
countrymen whom I have just now described to you, have to labour
under, to understand that there can be any such thing as “Brotherhood
of Man”. If you are readers of newspapers and if you take any
interest in what goes on outside the four corners of India, you may
know that, today, in that South Africa an attempt is being made by
the Government of the country to drive away the Indians, or,as it has
been well put by one of the newspapers here, English- owned, to
starve them out of South Africa; and in this scheme of starvation are
included some of these very men I have described to you. Whether
ultimately this thing will come to pass, whether ultimately the
Government of India will sanction or tolerate this thing, remains to
be seen. But the connection in which I mention this thing to you is,
as I have already told you, that it is difficult for such men to
realize the meaning of brotherhood; and yet I have undertaken to
speak to you on brotherhood at this time because it is in such times
of stress and difficulty that one’s spirit of brotherhood is really
tested.</p>

I receive compliments very often. They pass through my mind like
water poured on to a duck’s back. But you, Sir, have paid a
compliment to me this evening which I feel inclined to accept. You
think that if there is any person who has a right to speak on
Brotherhood of Man, at least I should have that right, and I think so
too. I have tried myself on many an occasion to find out whether it
is possible for me to hate—I don’t say love—my persecutor, and
I must honestly but in all humility confess to you that I have not
succeeded, I cannot recall a single occasion when I have felt
constrained to hate a single human being. How I came to it I do not
know. But I am simply giving to you a life-long practice and,
therefore, it is really literally true that, if there is any person
who has the right to speak on Brotherhood of Man, I at least have
that right.</p>

Brotherhood does not mean loving or sympathizing with those,
extending the hand of fellowship to those who will in return love
you. That is a bargain. Brotherhood is not a mercantile affair. And
my philosophy, my religion teaches me that brotherhood is not
confined merely to the human species; that is, if we really have 
imbibed the spirit of brotherhood, it extends to the lower animals.
In one of the magazines issued in England by those great
philanthropic societies 30 or 35 years ago, I remember having read
some beautiful verses. I think the  title  of  those verses  was <i>My
Brother Ox</i>. In them  the writer beautifully described how on a
man who loved his fellow men it was obligatory to love his
fellow-animals also, taking the word animals to mean the sub-human
species. The thought struck me most forcibly. At that time, I had
learnt very little of Hinduism. All I knew about it was what I had 
imbibed from my surroundings, from my parents and others. But I
realized the force of that  writing. However I do not intend today to
dwell upon this broadest brotherhood. I shall confine myself to
“Brotherhood of Man”.  I have brought this thing in order to
illustrate that our brotherhood is a mockery if we are not prepared
to love even our enemies. In other words, one who has imbibed the
spirit of brotherhood cannot possibly allow it to be said of him that
he has any enemy at all. People may consider themselves to be our
enemies, but we should reject any such claim. I have heard that claim
made; that is the reason why I use the word ‘claim’. The question
then arises: how is it possible to love those who consider themselves
to be our enemies? Almost every week, I receive letters either from
Hindus or from Mussalmans, sometimes from Christians, combating this
fundamental position that I have taken</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
up. If it is a Hindu who writes, then he asks me, “How is it
possible for me to love a Mussalman who kills the cow”, which is
dear to me as my life? Or if it is a Christian who writes to me, he
asks, “How is it possible to love Hindus who so ill-treat those
whom they call untouchables, Hindus who have suppressed a fifth of
their own numbers?” And  if  it  is  a Mussalman who writes, he
asks, “How  is  it possible to extend the hand of brotherhood or
fellowship to Hindus who are worshippers of stock and stone?” I say
to all these three: “Your brotherhood is of no value to me if you
cannot love the respective parties that you have described.” But
what does the attitude signify after all? Does it not signify
cowardly fear or intolerance? If all of us are God’s creation, why
should we fear one another or hate those who do not hold the same
belief that we do? A Hindu will ask me, is he to sit or look on,
while a Mussalman is doing something which is most repugnant to him?
My brotherhood replies, “Yes”. And I add “You must sacrifice
yourself, or in the language you have just listened to, you must bear
the cross. If you want to defend one who is dear to you, you must die
without killing.” I have personal experience of such occurrences.
If you have the courage to suffer lovingly, you melt the stoniest
heart. You may raise your hand against one whom you regard as a
ruffian, but how if he overpowers you? Will not the ruffian be more
ferocious because  of  his  victory  over you? Does not history show
that evil feeds on resistance? History also furnishes instances of
men having tamed the fiercest  men with their all-embracing love. But
I admit that such non- resistance requires far greater courage than
that of a soldier who returns two blows against one. I also admit
that if a man has anger instead of love in him for the evil-doer, it
is better for him to fight clean rather than, in a cowardly manner,
to sit still for fear of dying. Cowardice and brotherhood are
contradictory terms.  I  know that the world does not accept the
fundamental position that I have endeavoured to place before you. I
know that in Christian Europe, this doctrine of non-retaliation is
pooh-poohed. At the present moment, I am privileged to receive
precious letters from friends all over Europe and America, some of
them asking me to still further expound the doctrine of
non-resistance. Some others are laughing at me and telling me: “It
is all right for you to talk these things in India, but you dare not
do so in Europe.” Yet others tell me: “Our Christianity is a
whitewash, we do not understand the message of Jesus, it has got to
be still delivered to us, so that we can understand it.” All these
three</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
positions are more or less right from the standpoint of the writers. 
But I venture to tell you that there is no peace for this world, and
to take the name of brotherhood is a blasphemy, until we arrive at
this fundamental position. Men there are who ask and so also women
who ask: “Is it human to refrain from retaliation?” I say it is
human. Up to now we have not realized our humanity, we have not
realized our dignity; we are supposed to be, if Darwin is to be
believed, the descendants of monkeys, and I am afraid that we have
not yet shed our original state.</p>

The late Dr. Anna Kingsford in one of her books wrote once: “As I
walk about the streets of Paris, I seem to see before me diverse
lions and snakes personified.” She says these animals have only the
human form but no more. Man, to realize his full stature, has to
become absolutely fearless. This he will do not by being armed from
head to foot, but  by generating force from within. A Kshatriya is
one who does not fly from danger, he is not one who strikes a blow
for a blow. The <i>Mahabharata </i>says also that forgiveness is the
quality of a brave  man. There  is  a  statue  erected, I am told, 
in the memory of the late General Gordon. The sculptor does not put a
sword in his hands, he puts only a stick. It is considered to be a
beautiful work of art. If I was born a sculptor and I had the order,
I would not  have put even a stick in the hands of General Gordon,
but  I would have pictured him as one with folded arms, with his
chest  put forward in all humility telling the world: “Come, all of
you, who want to throw your darts, here is General Gordon to receive
them without flinching, without retaliation.” That is my ideal of a
soldier. Such soldiers have lived on the earth. Christianity undoub-
tedly has given birth to such solders, and so has Hinduism, so has
Islam. In my opinion, it is not true to say that Islam is a religion
of  the sword. History does not bear that out. But I am just now
speaking to you of individual instances, and what is true of the
individual can be true of nations or of groups of individuals; not
all at once, I admit, but in the process of evolution, when men after
men live this truth in their lives before our very eyes, they cannot
but affect us. Such is the history of Quakers. Such is the history of
Dukhobors whom Tolstoy has described. I do not know how far the
latter, after having gone to Canada, are carrying out their original
resolution, but the fact stands that they have lived this life of
non-resistance as a community. I therefore feel that we are trifling
with that sacred name,</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 2.62cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Brotherhood of Man, unless and until we are ruled  by  this
fundamental fact in life.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
What I am just now combating is the position that is taken up by some
of the finest writers in Europe and by some of the finest writers
even in India: that man, as a class, will never be able to arrive at
a stage when he can do without retaliation. I have a fundamental
quarrel with that position. On the contrary, I say that man, as man,
will not realize his full destiny, and his full dignity, until he has
been so far educated as to be able to refrain from retaliation.
Whether we like it or whether we do not like it, we are being driven
to it. It would be to our credit if, instead of being driven to the
position, we will take ourselves to it, and  I have come here this
evening to ask you to exercise this privilege, the privilege of
voluntarily taking up this idea in practice. Indeed, I ought not to
have to be speaking to a Christian audience on this, because some of
my friends tell me that I am really a Christian, when I talk about
non-retaliation. Little do they know that I have got to strive with
the Christians, as I have to with Hindus and my Muslim friends. I do
not know many Christians who have adopted this thing as a rule of
their life. Some of the very best Christians that I know do not admit
that this is the teaching of Christ. I do believe that it is the
teaching of Christ. They say it was meant merely for his twelve
disciples, not meant for the world, and they quote some passages from
the New Testament in support of their contention. The opponents of
non- violence as a rule of life say that it can only breed a race of
cowards, and if India takes up this message of non-retaliation, she
is a doomed country. On the contrary, the fundamental position that I
place before you is, that unless India takes up this position, she is
a doomed nation and with her all the nations of the world. India is a
continent, and when India takes up the doctrine of force, as Europe
today seems to have taken it up, then India becomes one of the
exploiters of the weaker races of the world. Just imagine what it
must mean to the world.</p>

I call myself a nationalist and I pride myself in it. My  nationalism
is as broad as the universe. It includes in its sweep even the lower
animals. It includes in its sweep all the nations of the earth, and
if I possibly could convince the whole of India of the truth of this
message, then, India would be something to the whole world for which
the world is longing. My nationalism includes the well-being of the
whole world. I do not want my India to rise on the ashes of other</p>

nations. I do not want India to exploit a single human being. I want
India to become strong in order that she can infect the other nations
also with her strength. Not so with the other nations of the world,
not so with a single nation in Europe today. They do not give
strength to the others. We are not receiving any strength. It is in
the nature of things impossible for them to do so, and that is why I
have taken the uncompromising position that I cannot possibly be a
party to a constitution whose basis is brute force.</p>

President Wilson mentioned his beautiful 14 points, and do you know
what he wound up with? He said:“After all, if this endeavour of
ours to arrive at peace fails, we have got our armaments to fall back
upon.” I want to reverse that position, and I say: “Our armaments
have failed already. Let us now be in search of something new, and
let us try the force of love and God which is Truth.” When we have
got that, we shall want nothing else. There is the story of the
devotee, Prahlad. It may be a fable, but no fable for me. He was a
lad of hardly 12 years. His father asked him not to take the name of
God. Prahlad said: “I can’t do without it, it is my life.” Then
his father asked him: “Show me your God.” A red hot iron pillar
was shown to Prahlad and he was aksed to embrace it. Yes, there was
God in that pillar. Prahlad embraced it in love and faith. He was
unhurt. If we would realize brotherhood, we must have the love and
the faith and the truth of Prahlad in us.</p>

Some time ago a serious-looking young Englishman named Harries
announced himself with a note of introduction from Shuaib Qureshi.
Without ceremony he at once told me that he had come to India for a
short stay in pursuit of a philosophical research in</p>

conversation, and allowed me to see that he did not require much
argument from me to make my meaning clear. Though he took me through
his examination with lightning speed, I saw that I could not satisfy
his appetite in the few minutes that I could then give him. I
promised him another appointment if he wanted it. He gratefully
accepted the offer. Next time he came with his friend and fellow-

dear to me, joined me in a philosophical investigation which I had
been carrying on for some years before. The aim of this investigation
was to expound a new system of thought which rose straight out of the
scepticism of the age. We had lost our faith in tradition long ago.
Contemporary life to us, except when it managed to avoid vital
issues, was as defunct as the existing institutions were long past
the stage where they could yield any new order of peace or a fresh
ideal of life. What seemed to be evident was that not before a more
compact and a less warlike though more efficient order of human
society had arisen, could there be any real peace or rest.</font></font></p>

Lest we forget our status and proper place in the imperial economy,
we receive a constant reminder now from England and now from South
Africa, or some such place, of what we are. The Secretary of State
for India puts us in mind of ‘the sharp edge of the British sword’.
The Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty’s forces in India gives it as
his deliberate opinion that what we are aiming at is ‘unattainable’.
Mr. Malan, the Union Minister in South Africa tells us that there
shall be no equality between Europeans and Indians, and that,
therefore, if he will not kill out the Indian settler, he will
squeeze him out of South Africa and will reduce him to such a state
that he cannot even think of equality. The ghetto is his proper
place, and menial labour his proper sphere of action. We must be and
remain a suppressed class of the world. To mention this evil is not
to get rid of it.‘No pariahs need apply’ is the permanent
sign-board which is hung up in every Imperial Secretariat. What to do
is the question. Pherozeshah Mehta disapproved even of my going to
South Africa. He said that nothing was to be done in South Africa
until we had vindicated our position in India. Lokamanya said much
the same thing. ‘Seek ye first swaraj and everything will be added
unto you’ was his refrain. But swaraj is a result of the sum-total
of India’s energy. The order of the day is work from without and
work from within. It is a long-drawn-out agony, but there is no new
birth without the necessary pains of labour. We must pass through
this inevitable life-giving, life-sustaining discipline, fiery though
it is. Our</p>

countrymen in South Africa must do the very best they can without
flinching. If they have the old spirit of resistance and cohesion in
them, and if they think that the moment has arrived, they must take
up the cross of suffering. They must be sole judges of their fitness
and of the psychological moment for taking the plunge. They must know
that public opinion of India is with them. But they will also realize
that it is an opinion which is powerless to help them. They must
therefore rely upon their own strength and capacity for enduring
hardships and in the innate justice of their cause.</p>

This represents the mentality of the average youth. Thousands of
young men have to be satisfied with Rs. 30 per month. But here this
political sufferer wants at lest Rs. 100 per month, or Rs. 2,000 at
least in a lump sum. There is no connection between the  two
proposals. But they are made in all good faith in the expectation of
acceptance. It is impossible to satisfy ambition such as this. The
Corporation of Calcutta cannot be used as a medium for finding work
for the unemployed. As a matter of fact, all the public departments
and private offices are almost over-supplied. The remedy, therefore,
lies, first, in modifying one’s ambition to suit the poor
environment of the country and, secondly, in finding new scope for
employment. Artificial wants must be curtailed; evil social customs
must be got rid of. The custom of one man supporting the rest of the
members of a family, although they may be able to do their share of
work, must go by the board. It is then possible to be satisfied with
Rs. 30 per month.</p>

Many young men in Bengal have voluntarily rearranged their ideas, and
are now living on Rs. 30 per month, whereas at one time they were
earning even as much as four to five hundred per month. The only new
source of employment which can give work to hundreds of young men and
women is a well-organized khaddar service. I am hoping that the
All-India Spinners’ Association that I have in view will soon come
into being. I am hoping also that the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial
will receive an adequate response from the public. Let all honest men
and women who are in search of employment qualify themselves by
becoming expert carders and spinners, if not also weavers. They will
not be called upon to earn their living by spinning and weaving, but
they will be called upon to organize production and sale. But this
organization will require on the part of the organizers an accurate
knowledge of the art of carding and spinning, and all the processes
which cotton has  to  undergo before it becomes weavable yarn.</p>

If the report is true, and it appears to me to be quite authentic,

aware they are used for decorating coffins. The flowers are held
together with a wire which often hurts. I am one of such individuals
who have been hurt by the wires of wreaths which have been forced
upon me by overzealous admirers. It is difficult to carry a wreath in
one’s hand for fear of getting hurt. A wreath being stiff instead
of adorning the body, in my opinion, disfigures it. Whereas  a  <i>mala

Hindus and Mussalmans—meaning, necessarily, the  majority of Hindus
and Englishmen. In the extract quoted my endeavour was to show that
Hindus had not the power even if they had the desire, to suppress
Mussalmans. The friends do not object to my statement if it applies
to Englishmen as a class in India,—not that they endorse my opinion
even to that extent, but they could not be shocked as they had known
me to hold that opinion for many years. But  they  were shocked
because they thought that I had included  in  the condemnation all
Englishmen, including the three friends who were honestly trying to
serve India to the best of their ability. They thought that the
passage was written in hatred and anger. As a matter of fact, there
was neither hatred nor anger at the time I wrote the passage, and if
the passage bears the meaning, which I still hold it does not, I can
only plead my ignorance of the English language which is not my
mother-tongue and whose intricacies, I own, I have not mastered. I
hold myself to be incapable of hating any being on earth. By a long
course of prayerful discipline, I have ceased for over forty years to
hate anybody. I know that this is a big claim. Nevertheless, I make
it in all humility. But I can and I do hate evil wherever it exists.
I hate the system of Government that the British people have set up
in India.  I hate the domineering manner of Englishmen as a class in
India. I hate the ruthless exploitation of India even as I hate from
the bottom of my heart the hideous system of untouchability for which
millions of Hindus have made themselves responsible. But I do not
hate the domineering Englishmen as I refuse to hate the domineering
Hindus. I seek to reform them in all the loving ways that are open to
me. My non-co-operation has its root not in hatred, but in love. My
personal religion peremptorily forbids me to hate anybody. I learnt
this simple yet grand doctrine when I was twelve years old, though a
school book, and the conviction has presisted up to now. It is daily
growing on me. It is a burning passion with me. I beg therefore to
assure every Englishman, who like these friends might have
misunderstood me, that I shall never be guilty of hating Englishmen
even though I might have to fight them fiercely, even as I did in
1921. It will be a non-violent fight, it will be clean, it will be
truthful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
Mine is not an exclusive love. I cannot love Mussalmans or Hindus and
hate Englishmen. For, if I merely love Hindus and Mussalmans because
their ways are on the whole pleasing to me, I shall soon begin to
hate them when their ways displease me, as they may well do any
moment. A love that is based on the goodness of</p>

those whom you love is a mercenary affair, whereas true love is self
effacing and demands no consideration. It is like that of a model
Hindu wife, Sita, for instance, who loved her Rama even whilst he bid
her pass through a raging fire. It was well with Sita, for she knew
what she was doing. She sacrificed herself out of her strength, not
out of her weakness. Love is the strongest force the world possesses
and yet it is the humblest imaginable.</p>

Now, the difficulty that has occurred to the friend is a difficulty
that faces a reformer at every step. Have not untruth and hypocrisy
permeated society? Yet those who believe in the ultimate triumph of
truth, persist in it in the absolute hope of success. A reformer
never permits time to run against him, for he defies that ancient
enemy. Of course, industrialism is like a force of Nature, but it is
given to man to control Nature and to conquer her forces. His dignity
demands from him resolution in the face of overwhelming odds. Our
daily life is such a conquest. An agriculturist knows it only too
well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
What is industrialism but a control of the majority by a small
minority? There is nothing attractive about it, nor is there anything
inevitable in it. If the majority simply wills to say ‘no’ to the
blandishments of the minority, the latter is powerless for mischief.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It is good to have faith in human nature. I live because I have that
faith. But that faith does not blind me to the fact of history that,
whilst in the ultimate all is well, individuals and groups called
nations have before now perished. Rome, Greece, Babylon, Egypt and
many others are a standing testimony in proof of the fact that
nations have perished before now because of their misdeeds. What may
be hoped for is that Europe, on account of her fine and scientific
intellect, will realize the obvious and retrace her steps, and from
the demoralizing industrialism she will find a way out. It will not
necessarily be a return to the old absolute simplicity. But it will
have to be a reorganization in which village life will predominate,
and in which brute and material force will be subordinated to the
spiritual force.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Lastly, we must not be entrapped by false analogies. European writers
are handicapped for want of experience and accurate information. They
cannot guide us beyond a certain measure if they have to generalize
from European examples which cannot be on all fours with Indian
conditions, because in Europe they have nothing like the conditions
of India, not even excluding Russia. What may be, therefore, true of
Europe is not necessarily true of India. We know, too, that each
nation has its own characteristics and individuality. India has her
own; and if we are to find out a true solution for her many ills, we
shall have to take all the idiosyncrasies of her constitution into
account, and then prescribe a remedy. I claim that to industrialize
India in the same sense as Europe is to attempt the impossible. India</p>

has stood many a storm. Each has left its own indelible mark it is
ture, but she has hitherto dauntlessly maintained her individuality.
India is one of the few nations of the earth which have witnessed the
fall of many civilizations, herself remaining scatheless. India is
one of the few nations on the earth which have retained some of their
ancient institutions although they have been overlaid with
superstition and error. But she has hitherto shown an inherent
capacity for purging herself of error and superstition. My faith in
her ability to solve the economic problem that faces her millions has
never been so bright as it is today, especially after my study of the
conditions in Bengal.</p>

devitalized and have lost all initiative. I gave them an answer which
satisfied them for the time being, but they took from me a promise
that I would deal with the problem in these pages.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
In my opinion, the root of the evil lies in the foreign domination,
and the root of foreign domination lies in ourselves. I am aware that
we shall never deal with these problems unless and until we deal with
the root evil. If we had our own government, the teachers would be
able to vindicate their position. Having our own government</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
means a government never strong enough to override by force of arms
the wishes of the majority, in other words, a government responsible
to public opinion. Today the teachers have public opinion behind them
in many things, but it is helpless against a power that is armed for
dealing with any possible physical combination on the part of the
people of India. No government in the world is so irresponsible and
so unresponsive to the opinion of the millions of men and women of
India as the Government of India. It was the realization of this fact
that made Gokhale postpone everything else to the effort for winning
self-government. Lokamanya was so impatient that he made his formula,
“Swaraj is my birthright”, ring from one end of India to the
other. He suppressed his taste for scholarship and philosophy  in
favour of swaraj. Deshbandhu laid down his life in the same pursuit.
All those who are like the teachers have, therefore, no remedy for
their disease save that of gaining swaraj as quickly as possible. How
is that to be attained. I have pointed out the remedy and the country
is supposed to have adopted it. The only change is that to the effort
within must be added the effort without, viz., entry into  the
legislatures. The teachers cannot enter these institutions, they
cannot take part in active politics, but they can all spin or, if
they like, do some other labour. They must not expect their pupils to
labour, if the teachers will not labour themselves and I have
suggested spinning because all can be engaged in it, not for private
profit, but for discipline and national profit. Self-government means
continuous effort to be independent of government control, whether it
is foreign government or whether it is national. Swaraj government
will be a sorry affair if people look up to it for the regulation of
every detail of life. Do the teachers realize that the pupils are an
exaggerated edition of what they themselves are? If they will have
the initiative, the pupils will soon begin to have it. The
examination system, as it is, becomes doubly oppressive by reason of
the mechanical method of instruction. Only the other day, inspecting
a school, I asked a boy to tell me what and where Pataliputra—about
which he had read to me from his book—was. He could not tell. This
was neither the fault of the Government nor the pupils, assuredly the
teachers’. Teachers can, if they will, make their tuition
interesting and effective in spite of the deadening weight of the
examination system. In spite of the medium of instruction being the
English language in the higher classes, it is open to the teachers to
take care of the mother tongue of the boys under them. There is no
rule preventing them talking to the boys in</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
their mother tongues. The fact is that most teachers do not know the
vernacular names for technical expressions and find it difficult to
make themselves intelligible in the vernacular when the subject of
their discourse is technical. We have got into the very slovenly
habit, in order, as we fancy to give point to our conversations, of
using English adjectives, adverbs and even phrases of the English
language. If the teachers wish it, many of the defects of the present
system could be cured by them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have given only a few out of many possible illustrations of what
can be done under the present system. It was my recognition of the
evil of the system that made me conceive non-co-operation, but a
revival of it just now seems to be almost an impossibility. I am,
therefore, recommending what is, in some respects, more difficult of
accomplishment. It is easier for the average man to run away from
evil than remain in it and still remain unaffected by it. Many men
can shun grog-shops and remain teetotallers, but not many can remain
in these pestilential places and avoid the contagion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.49cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
However, the teachers have asked for advice and I can but place it
before them so that each may then respond to the best of his ability.
The unfortunate position is that educated Indians take to teaching
not for the love of it, but because they have nothing better and
nothing else for giving them a livelihood. Many of them even enter
the teaching profession with a view to preparing for what they regard
as a better thing. The wonder is that in spite of this self- imposed
initial handicap so many teachers are  not worse than they are. By
well-ordered agitation, no doubt, they may better their pecuniary
prospects, but I see no chance even under a swaraj government of the
scale of salary being raised much higher than it is today. I believe
in the ancient idea of teachers teaching for the love of it and
receiving the barest maintenance. The Roman Catholics have retained
that idea and they are responsible for some of the best educational
institutions in the world. The <i>rishis </i>of old did even better.
They made their pupils members of their families, but in those days
that class of teaching which they imparted was not intended for the
masses. They simply brought up a race of real teachers of mankind in
India. The masses got their training in their homes and in their
hereditary occupations. It was a good enough ideal for those times.
Circumstances have now changed. There is a general insistent demand
for literary training. The masses claim the same attention as the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
classes. How far it is possible and beneficial to mankind generally
cannot be discussed here. There is nothing inherently wrong in the
desire for learning. If it is directed in a healthy channel it can
only do good. Without, therefore, stopping to devise means for
avoiding the inevitable, we must make the best use possible of it.
Thousands of teachers cannot be had for the asking, nor will they
live by begging. They must have a salary guaranteed, and as we shall
require quite an army of teachers their remuneration cannot be in
proportion to the intrinsic worth of their calling but it will have
to be in proportion to the capacity of the nation for payment. We may
expect a steady rise as we realize the relative merits of the
different callings. The rise must be painfully slow. There must,
therefore, arise a class of men and women in India who will from
patriotic motives choose teaching as a profession, irrespective of
the material gain that it may bring them. Then the nation will not
underrate the calling of the teacher. On the contrary, it will give
the first place in its affection to these self- sacrificing men and
women. And so we come to this that, as our swaraj is possible largely
by our own efforts, so is the teachers’ rise possible mainly by
their own effort. They must bravely and patiently cut their way
through to success.</p>

I came here what was the quantity of these charities. I understand
from reliable sources that they amount to more than one crore of
rupees. I had flattered myself with the belief that my Parsi friends
beat everyone on the face of the earth in their charities, and I
suppose, now, that statement will stand unchallenged so far as the
whole community is concerned; but so far as individuals are
concerned,  I  do  not recollect a single Parsi name that has
exceeded the charities of Cossimbazar. As I told you, therefore, it
is a double pleasure for me to meet you this afternoon.</p>

I thank you for the purse that you have presented towards the
Deshbandhu Memorial. You know better than I do how much the student
world is indebted to Deshbandhu not merely because he was one of
their patrons, not merely because the students found his purse open
for them, but also because his advice was always at the disposal of
students, and he has left to the student world a legacy of self-
sacrifice and devotion to the motherland which is not to be surpassed
by anybody, if it can be at all equalled. It is, therefore, nothing
out of the way that you have given this good purse for this memorial
and I hope that students all over Bengal will follow your noble
example.</p>

You have asked me to answer certain questions which you have put to
me. I have understood these questions. I have not given myself much
time to speak to you this afternoon, but before I come to these
questions, I want to talk to you of things that are much more
permanent for students and, therefore, of much greater importance
than even the important questions that you have put to me. Throughout
my travels in the world and my association with students and my
experience as an amateur teacher of youth and of girls, I have come
to the conclusion that the literary knowledge that a schoolmaster or
a professor gives is by no means composed of what he has to give. You
are not to be judged by the excellene of your pronunciation or by the
excellence of your grammar, not even by the excellence of your
eloquence; for that matter you might have never come to colleges, and
yet it is possible for you to give a good account of yourselves to
the world, it is possible for you to live a decent life as citizens
of India—as citizens of the world. What you come to schools and
colleges for is essentially to build your character. The highest
ideal that can possibly be conceived for the student life has been
placed before us by our Hindu ancestors, the great <i>rishis </i>of
old. They likened the life of a student to that of a sannyasi, and
they have laid</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
down laws for the guidance of students just as rigorous as those they
have laid down for the fourth ashrama, the fourth stage—the stage
of a sannyasi. What a sannyasi is expected to do after a full
expericnce of the world, out of the fullness of his knowledge, a
student is voluntarily expected to do because of tradition, because
of regard for his spiritual and for his worldly preceptors. You know
the distinction between worldly knowledge and divine knowledge. They
used  worldly ambition and worldly knowledge also for the uplift of
the soul, and even whilst they discoursed on matters of the world,
they gave us a secret knowledge of the soul. Anyone who has studied
the glorious Upanishads will be able, without the slightest
hesitation, to corroborate what I am just now telling you. Ask
yourselves then, “Are  you leading the life of a sannyasi, are
you—all of you—<i>brahmacharis</i><i> </i>?”

Throughout my travels in Bengal I have heard a lot about the students
of Bengal. I have heard something to your credit. I have also heard
something to your discredit. I have been told that the life of the
average student in Bengal, if not throughout India, is not
particularly pure. He spends his time not in reading the purest
literature, but he even devotes his spare hours to reading magazines
which should never find a place in a decent library or in a
gentleman’s drawing-room. I do not know how far this is true. But
what I have told, I have received from men of knowledge, from men of
culture, from men who have passed from those colleges. Some of them
have declared to me that such is the life of the students of Bengal.
They have told me that there is a general but sure deterioration in
character. I hope this is not a proper and truthful generalization
and that the average student is not so bad as he is made out to be. I
recall to myself a story told by a Hindu widow, some weeks ago, with
tears in her eyes. She has several daughters, some of whom are not
yet married. She asked me what she was to do with her daughters. They
are all educated. She is not sparing herself in order to give her
daughters a decent education. I asked her what the ages of these
daughters were. In my opinion they are not yet fit to be married. The
mother said, “How can I help marrying my girls? Can you show me a
place where I can hide them, where I can consider that my girls will
be in safety?” She said, “You do not know the young men of
Bengal, you do not know how dangerous it is for young girls to walk
about unprotected; they are not free from the lustful eyes of
students who walk about the streets of Calcutta.” Can this be true?
I hope it is not. But that widowed mother is not an illiterate woman.
Let me tell you she is a great Congress worker; she</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
spoke from knowledge, she spoke from the bitterness of her own
experience and she said, “You may ask anybody you like, and you
will find that, in general, my remarks will be corroborated by the
parents in Bengal.”</p>

I have read only lately a paragraph in newspapers that a girl—I
forget her name—committed suicide. I am not talking to you about
Snehalata of a sacred memory, but I am talking to you of a girl who
has recently committed suicide. She is supposed to have committed
suicide because her father could not find a suitable match for his
daughter. Why? Because, as the newspapers relate, a frightful sum was
asked by young men who were approached by the  parents.  Is marriage
a matter of money, is it a bargain or is it a sacred institution? Is
it a matter of love or is it a matter of commerce? What have we
learnt in our colleges and schools ? If this is true, as it seems to
me to be true, the responsibility for the death of the girl lies upon
the heads of the students of Bengal. If it is true it is for everyone
of you to correct that evil. Let us not talk of swaraj, let us not
talk of liberty of India, so long as the liberty of a single girl in
Bengal is imperilled, so long as a girl finds it necessary to commit
suicide because her parents have not got money enough to buy a
suitable match. Let this blot be removed from the face of Bengal and
let the students of Bengal be worthy of the charity of Cossimbazar.
Let the students prove to the world, let them prove to the parents of
Bengal that the honour of every girl in Bengal is as sacred in their
hands as it is sacred or should be in the hands of her parents; and
unless we learn this primary lesson  I feel that we have lived in
vain, that the students have lived in vain in Bengal, and all this
money that is being spent upon them in giving them a liberal
education, in housing them in magnificient buildings, is a waste of
effort and waste of money. May God give you strength and the wisdom
to understand the substance of what I am telling you. Do not
criticize it, do not talk high of it, but say to yourselves how far
the information given to me is likely to be correct. But if it is an
overstatement, it is still damning enough for the student world. If
it is true of several hundreds of students, I ask you to regard it as
a dangerous thing. It is an eyesore, it is a canker that is eating
into the very vitals of society, and that kind of evil will spread
throughout the length and breadth of Bengal, if it is not nipped in
the bud. Therefore, without criticizing my remarks to you and trying
to measure the truth of it in golden scales, take the substance of it
and make the best use, what every one of you can, of what I have
said.</p>

The <i>rishis </i>of old tell us that the education of a student
begins not with literature. Do you know what the student in the Vedic
times was called upon to do when he went to the teachers? Not to pass
any examination in letters. He had to go before the <i>rishis </i>with
<i>samid </i><i>khand</i>—with a bundle of wood—in his hand. What
did that signify? It signified purity of heart, sincerity of heart.
It signified determination on the part of the student to labour for
his preceptor, so that he could get from his preceptor what he
deserved. He was not to ask any questions; he was to take what the
preceptor gave him. If you are satisfied with learning by heart
brilliant passages from Shakespeare and Milton, I do not grudge you
that. But it must be added to something that is more substantial. You
must build upon a stable foundation—you must build, therefore, upon
a foundation of absolute truth—you must build upon a foundation of
a absolute love and non- violence. It is obligatory upon  every
student to observe these fundamental maxims of life. You know what
the <i>Mahabharata </i>taught us about the value of truth. He said,
“Put truth in one scale and put your <i>yajnas </i>in another
scale. Still truth will weigh heavier.” There is nothing on this
earth, the seer of <i>Mahabharata </i>tells us, that can possibly
excel truth. And he was right. No matter how much in your little bit
of experience you may find untruth work, no matter how you find in
history also, fraud has given princes and potentates power and
kingdoms, remember that these are only momentary changes. What are a
few thousands of years in the life of a nation, in the life of the
whole world? As students, you are not to bother your heads about
these things; make up your minds to follow truth and non-violence. If
you only remember these sign-posts, you will never go wrong and then
you may add all the literature and all the science and everything.
But if you have not this foundation, then however beautiful the house
may appear to be for the time being, remember it is only a house of
cards, and a mere whiff of wind will bring it down.</p>

Now I come to the questions. You ask me what the spinning- wheel can
do. Well, I think I have demonstrated to you what the spinning-wheel
can do. The spinning-wheel will do for India what it did when the
<i>rishis </i>lived. That was the golden age. I do not for one moment
endorse what some historians tell us, that the golden age is merely a
figment of the imagination or the diseased minds of poets. It is not
so. We had our golden age. We are certainly coming to another cycle
which will lead to another golden age. We have lived through that
golden age when, in this land, there were not these semi-starved</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
millions as they are today. The creed of the spinning-wheel is that
there should be a bond established between yourselves and the
villagers; that is the meaning of village reconstruction—that is
your another question. And the village reconstruction must dance
round your charkha as the centre. You may not go to the villages,
unless you take a little bit of bread to the semi-starved villagers.
They will starve. During six months, if Sir P. C. Ray is to be
depended upon, for six solid months cultivators of India, i.e.,
eighty percent of the population of India—have no work. They are
idle. Do you suppose that the peasantry of any part of the world can
possibly enjoy four months’ holiday and make both ends meet. Not
even a millionaire in this age will be able to enjoy four months’
holiday. They soon find there is a deficit to meet or there is some
hopeless mismanagement of their estate. If you want to take a little
bit of life into these little cottages of India, you will only do so
by the revolution of the charkha and, therefore, I say, whoever draws
one yard of yarn per day, has added to the wealth of India; he has
done something to alleviate the distress, and as the <i>Gita </i>says
:</p>

You are the future great men of India, you are the salt of the earth.
If you, the future hope of India, do not know how to deal with this
problem—the very serious problem of poverty of the masses— how
are you going to solve it ? What is your education worth? Are you
content to rest upon the ashes of seven hundred thousand villages?
Will you allow the seven hundred thousand villages to be blotted out
off the face of the earth, and if in India there may be a few, say a
hundred, cities containing a population, of not three hundred
millions but probably twenty millions, can you be satisfied with that
and that all these villagers should die out? Will you perform the
process that Mr. Malan of South Africa suggested? He says he won’t
drive the Indians out by the stroke of pen, but he will starve them
out. In order that you may receive liberal education, villagers will
starve! Is it economics of India? Study the figures and find out
where all these millions upon millions of rupees go. Dadabhai Naoroji
gave some figures, but it was child’s play before the discoveries
which are being made now from day to day, because of the double drain
from India. The bulk of the revenue which supports this great
military expenditure comes from the villages—that is one drain. But
there is another drain—the drain of labour; not that the labourers
are taken</p>

away but the people are becoming incapacitated for work, so that
later on they will say, “We have lost all vigour for work.” All
that we can do is to adjust the revenue a little bit. Hence it is I
say to the students, you must spin for half an hour and wear khaddar.</p>

You ask me a question about mill cloth <i>versus </i>foreign cloth.
You have not studied the recent economics. I place mill cloth and
foreign cloth in the same category. I will not have you wear mill
cloth that comes from Ahmedabad, Bombay or even Banga Lakshmi. That
is meant for those who do not think of India, who do not think of her
future. Therefore, for you the real economics is to wear khaddar.
When you wear khaddar, you are supporting the labour of a poor
weaver. If you are to wear khaddar, you will be supporting many
widows, you will be supporting many of your cultivators who may spin
during their idle hours. You will be supporting many weavers who are
not getting today sufficient for their labour. Study any
history—economic history—and it will tell you that the majority
of weavers have died out. Thank God, the weavers as a class have not
died! Do you know that in the Punjab the majority of weavers have
either become butchers or worse, because they have become soldiers
who shot the innocent Chinese in Shanghai and who shot innocent men
in Turkey and in all parts of the world? What is this the weavers of
the Punjab have been reduced to? There is nothing wrong in becoming
soldiers, in becoming butchers. I say it is wrong giving up their
honourable calling as weavers. It is a sin for which you and I are
responsible. Hence I tell you the real economics for you are that you
should wear khaddar. You should spin and spin. Spin in order to make
khaddar cheap. That is discipline for you. It will enable you to
create your purity. Sit at the spinning-wheel calmly for half an hour
and watch the transformation of your heart. I can quote to you
instances of many men and women, of brilliant administrators, one of
whom was a member in the Bombay Executive Council. He is as old as I
am. He learnt spinning only a few months ago. He said: “After I
began spinning at the wheel, I have somewhat got rid of my insomnia. 
I returned from office tired, sometimes at mid-night and, then, I was
dozing, thinking of many problems which I did not want to think of.
Now I sit at the spinning-wheel and spin away. Immediately comes the
all-refreshing sleep—the sleep of innocence.” Find out for
yourselves what it can do. Find out what it cannot do.</p>

a scavenger, weaver, spinner, farmer and what not, and I do not feel
ashamed that some of these things I know but indifferently. It is a

without labour we can do nothing. There is a great Latin saying of
which the meaning is ‘to labour is to pray’, and one of the
finest writers of Europe has said that a man is not entitled to eat
unless he labours, and by labour he does not mean labour with the
intellect, but labour with the hands. The same thought runs

labour does not conflict with my friendship with capital. And believe
me, throughout my public service of 35 years, though I have been
obliged to range myself seemingly against capital, capitalists have
in the end regarded me as their true friend. And in all humility I
maysay that I have come here also as a friend of the capitalists—a
friend of the Tatas. And here it would be ungrateful on my part if I
do not give you a little anecdote about how my connection with the
Tatasbegan. In South Africa, when I was struggling along with the the
Indians there in the attempt to retain our self-respect and to
vindicate our status, it was the late Sir Ratan Tata who first came
forward with assistance. He wrote me a great letter and sent a
princely donation,—a cheque for Rs. 25,000 and a promise in the
letter to send more, if necessary. Ever since I have a vivid
recollection of my relations with the Tatas and you can well imagine
how pleasurable it has been for me to be with you, and you will
believe me when I say that, when I part company with you tomorrow, I
shall do so with a heavy heart, because I shall have to go away
without having seen so many things, for it would be presumption on my
part to say at the end of two days that I had really studied things
here, I know well enough  the magnitude of the task before one who
wants to study this great enterprise.</p>

I wish to this great Indian firm all the prosperity that it deserves
and to this great enterprise every success. And may I hope that the
relations between this great house and labourers who work here under
their care will be of the friendliest character? At Ahmedabad I have
had much to do with the capitalists and workmen, and I have always
said that my ideal is that capital and labour should supplement and
help each other. They should be a great family living in unity and
harmony, capital not only looking to the material welfare of the
labourers but their moral welfare also,—capitalists being trustees
for the welfare of the labouring classes under them.</p>

I have said that I am a non-co-operator, I call myself a civil
resister—and both words have come to possess a bad odour in the
English language like so many other English words—but I non-co-
operate in order that I may be able to co-operate. I cannot satisfy
myself with false co-operation—anything inferior to 24 carats gold.
My non-co-operation does not prevent me from being friendly even to
Sir Michael O’Dwyer and General Dyer. It harms no one, it is non-
co-operation with evil, with an evil system and not with the
evil-doer. My religion teaches me to love even an evil-doer, and my
non-co- operation is but part of that religion. I am saying these
things not to soothe the ears of any one—I have in my life never
been guilty of saying things I did not mean—my nature is to go
straight to the heart, and if often I fail in doing so for the time
being, I know that truth will ultimately make itself heard and felt,
as it has often done in my experience. The wish, therefore, that the
relations between you should be of the friendliest character is a
desire from the bottom of my heart. And it is my deep prayer that you
may help in delivering India from evil and bondage and help her to
give the message of peace to the outside world. For this meeting of
Indians and Europeans in India must have or can be made to have a
special meaning, and what can be better than that we two may live
together so as to spread peace and goodwill on earth? May God grant

realize that you are here for a much higher mission than merely
working for an industrial enterprise.</p>

<i>PROBLEMS OF NON-VIOLENCE</i></h1>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.29cm; line-height: 102%">
People keep asking me which  acts  may be termed violent  and which
non-violent and, what is one’s duty at a particular time. While
some of these queries reveral the ignorance of the inquirers, others
serve to bring out the difficult dilemmas involved. A Punjabi
gentleman has put a question the answer to which is worth giving
here. It is as follows :</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 2.62cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
What should be done when tigers, wolves and other wild beasts come
and carry away other animals or human beings? Or, what should</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; line-height: 5%"><br/>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
In my humble opinion the simple answer is that where there is danger
from tigers, wolves and so on, then killing them becomes inevitable.
The germs that water contains must also be inevitably destroyed.
Violence which is inevitable does not therefore cease to be so and
become non-violence. It has to be recognized as violence. I have no
doubt that it would be best if we could contrive to sruvive without
destroying tigers, wolves, etc. However, who could do so?Only he who
is not afraid of these animals and can regard them as friends, he
alone could do so. Anyone who refrains from violence because he is
afraid, is nevertheless guilty of violence. The mouse is not non-
violent towards the cat. At heart, he always has a feeling of
violence towards the cat. He cannot kill the latter because he is
weak. He alone has the power to practise the dharma of ahimsa who
although fully capable of inflicting violence does not inflict it. He
alone practises the ahimsa dharma who voluntarily and with love
refrains from inflicting violence on anyone. Non-violence implies
love, compassion, forgiveness. The Shastras describe these as the
virtues of the brave. This courage is not physical but mental.There
have been instances of physically frail men having indulged in grave
acts of violence with the help of others. There have also been cases
where those as physically strong as Yudhishthira<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>have granted pardon to such persons as king Virata<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
Hence, so long as one has not developed inner strength, one can never
practise the dharma of ahimsa. The non-violence practised by the
banias today does not deserve the name; one finds in it cruelty
sometime and ignorance all the time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 101%">
It was because I know this weakness of ours that during the War I
went all out to recruit soldiers in Kheda.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3
</font></sup>And, it was for this very reason that I said at that
time that perhaps the most brutal act of the British Government was
to have disarmed and thus emasculated the Indian people. I hold the
same view even today. If anyone afraid at heart cannot, while
remaining unarmed, rid himself of that fear, he should certainly arm
himself with a stick or an even more deadly weapon.</p>

edge of a sword. Complete adherence to it is almost impossible for
one who has a physical form. Severe penance is required for its
practice. Penance should be taken to mean renunciation and knowledge.
Anyone who desires to possess land cannot practise ahimsa. A peasant
necessarily has to protect his land. He must guard it against tigers
and wolves. A peasant who is not prepared to punish these animals or
thieves, etc., should always be prepared to abandonhis field.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 101%">
In order to be able to practise the dharma of ahimsa, man must abide
by the limits laid down by the Shastras and custom. The Shastras do
not enjoin violence. But they permit certain acts of  violence by
regarding them as unavoidable at particular times. For instance, it
is believed that the  <i>Manusmrit</i><i>i</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>permits
the slaughter of certain animals. Such slaughter has not been
ordained. Thereafter, with progress in thinking, it was decided that
this would not be permitted in the Kaliyuga<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup>.
Hence it is customary today to regard certain forms of violence as
pardonable, while some of the forms of violence allowed by <i>Manusmriti
</i>are forbidden. It is obviously wrong to argue that we can go
beyond the concessions allowed by  the Shastras. There is dharma in
self-control  and,  <i>adharma</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3
 </font></sup>in indulgence. Anyone who does not make use of the
latitude given by the Shastras deserves to be congratulated. Ahimsa
knows no limits because there are none to self-control. The latter
has been welcomed by all the scriptures of the world, while opinions
differ widely regarding indulgence. A right angle is the same
everywhere, while there is no end to the number of other angles.
Non-violence and truth together form, as it were, the right angle of
all religions. Conduct which does not fit into that angle should
undoubtedly be given up. Imperfect conduct may, perhaps, be
permitted. Anyone who practises the dharma of ahimsa should increase
his inner strength by being always on the alert and progressively
restricting the latitude that he has allowed for himself. There is
certainly nothing religious about indulgence. Renouncing through
knowledge the worldly life—this is the attainment of <i>moksha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt"><i>4</i></font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt"><i>

This death anniversary has come and gone. It was celebrated here—in

What does a son do on the death anniversary of his father? If he is a
worthy son, he does not make a speech on his father’s virtues but
rather does something that the latter would have liked him to do. In
the present-day meetings too we shall not invite the sons and
relatives of the departed leaders to make speeches. Both they and we
should be ashamed if we did. The death anniversaries of two leaders
came in close succession, viz., that of Moulvi Abdul Rasul and later
that of Lokamanya. I saw the former gentleman’s son-in-law at the
first meeting. No one asked him to make a speech; that task was left
to others. This would suggest that just as fingers are kept at a
distance from the nail, we too are separated by a distance from
relatives. As a matter of fact, this should not be the case. If a son
is not permitted to sing his father’s praises like a minstrel, we
too should not do so.</p>

I had, therefore, decided against singing praises. I felt embarrassed
on the day of the anniversary. Only the previous day I had spoken of
the spinning-wheel in the same hall. Would I have to repeat all that
again? I received the reply: “Where will you run to for fear of
criticism, derision or defeat? You have assumed the task of adhering
to truth. Of what consequence is it if that which appears to be true
to you does not appear to be so to the rest of the world? It is your
dharma to tell the truth and practise it.” Hence, I repeated the
very same things.</p>

half of it, which we did as follows: “The spinning-wheel and khadi
are the means of obtaining it.” Swaraj is not for the educated
class alone. It is not for Hindus or Muslims alone, nor is it only
for the wealthy class. Lokamanya’s swaraj is for Hindus, Muslims,
Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, all. It is for the educated as well the
uneducated, for men as well as women, for villagers as well as
city-dwellers. Moreover, this swaraj is such that all should take a
more or less equal part in the effort to secure it. That which can be
secured through the efforts of a single section of people or a single
community is not swaraj but rather rule by that particular community
or section. What then is the activity which everyone can take up and
which leads to the  growth  of everone’s strength? Spining is such
an activity. We cannot have cloth without spinning and without
spinning we cannot save sixty crores of rupees which are spent in
buying cloth from abroad. Moreover, our purpose will not be served if
we just save this sum. It should be distributed among crores of
Indians.</p>

The spinning-wheel is the only answer to this problem. We can boycott
foreign cloth by means of an acitivity which can be taken up by all
and which yields good results. Moreover, by doing so we can become
strong enough to preserve swaraj as well as to secure  it. Hence,
those who have come to pay homage to Lokamanya should altogether
renounce foreign cloth, wear khadi alone and spin every day for at
least half an hour.</p>

<i>Ramanam </i>was dear to Prahlad while he was sleeping, sitting,

a similar situation with regard to khadi and the spinning-wheel. Even
if someone were to tie me up and flog me, I would still cry out that
the spinning-wheel and khadi are the means of securing swaraj. There
may be—should be—many satellites revolving round it; but, just as
the solar system without the sun is nothing, just as an army without
a general is like a corpse, just as all activities are futile without
Rama, even so without the spinning-wheel all other activities for
swaraj are futile.</p>

On the occasion of Moulvi Abdul Rasul’s death anniversary, I was
given the honour of presiding over the meeting. I had not known the
said gentleman personally but, on inquiry, was informed that although
he was a learned barrister, he was humble, a whole-hearted supporter
of swaraj and one who maintained his independence and self-respect.
He regarded Hindu-Muslim unity as a dharma and was a devotee of
swadeshi.</p>

How could I make myself worthy of presiding over a meeting on the
death anniversary of such a gentleman? My <i>takli </i>which shares
whatever fate has in store for me, which is my goddess of peace,
which  is the source of relief to the poor and miserable in India—
is always with me. For fear of having it some day separated from me,
through oversight, it is now included in the same case as my
spectacles or, more precisely, the latter share the same case with
the <i>takli</i>. I cannot leave it behind any more than I can my
spectacles. I took it out and started spinning. I was no longer
worried whether the speeches were interesting or otherwise and I
started giving an object-lesson in swadeshi which was dear to Maulana
Rasul. At the same time as the speeches, my stock of slivers was
coming to an end too. The audience benefited in two ways, by
listening to the words of the speakers and by looking at the message
spelt out by my hands.</p>

What else would I have to say even at the conclusion of the meeting?
My true speech took the form of action. Hence, by way of explanation,
I spoke on the spinning-wheel. Swadeshi was dear to Maulana Rasul but
he had not fully understood its true implications.We had come to
bestow the name of “swadeshi”  on those musical instruments or
clocks whose parts had all been imported but which had been assembled
here. We know now that practical and widespread swadeshi means
hand-woven khadi made of hand-spun yarn. This was the interpretation
of the message given by my hands.</p>

I take every opportunity of paying a visit to Shrimati Basanti Devi.
I have not yet succeeded in persuading her to go out daily for a
walk. Her courage knows no bounds. However, she cannot shake off her
mental agony. She can take interest in nothing. Often, late at night,
she visits the cremation ground. But that is not to forget her
sorrow; it is rather to add to it. There is only one thing in which
she can keep herself occupied. She plies the spinning-wheel for two
hours at a stretch and likes the work. The famous European poet
Goethe makes the heroine of his best play—<i>Faust </i>—hold a
spinning-wheel and sing the sweetest of songs. Sir Prabhashanker
Pattani described in his public speech the effect the spinning-wheel
had on him. It is worth while remembering it on this occasion. He
suffers from insomnia. Hence, even at midnight he plies the
spinning-wheel. In this way, he overcomes various mental anxieties
suffered during the day and then he can sleep peacefully. The
spinning-wheel, in this manner, has been able to bring relief to a
politician, one who is separated from a dear one and a widow.</p>

From some figures published by the Gujarat Khadi Mandal relating to
propagation of khadi, I find that there are thirty khadi- promoting
institutions in Maha Gujarat. The khadi produced in the last twelve
months by 16 of these institutions out of yarn spun by its members
themselves or of purchased hand-spun yarn, amounted to more than
2,64,000 square yards. The sale of khadi in that period amounted to
Rs. 3,85,761-1-3. The net sale proceeds after deducting various
charges, etc., are slightly smaller. The figures include khadi that
has been brought from outside— for example, Andhra.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
This quantity of khadi cannot be regarded as the total quantity
produced by Gujarat. For instance, at some places in Kutch and
Kathiawar, where the spinning-wheel had never ceased working, the
weaving of khadi goes on all the time. Nevertheless, the above</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
quantity is far less than what we wish to achieve.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Besides these figures, the following is worth knowing: the  number of
spinning-wheels, the number of persons who weave hand- spun yarn, how
many of these latter have taken to weaving again because of the
swadeshi movement and how many of them are  weavers who have recently
learnt this art, how many of them are the so-called untouchables and
what is their monthly income, etc. We should find out: the number of
spinning-wheels that are in use as a means of livelihood and the
number of those which are being used as  a sacrificial offering, what
is the value of the khadi which was brought over from other parts;
how many volunteer workers there are in these organizations and of
these how many are paid workers and  how many honorary; the amount of
the average salary paid to a person and what is the maximum and
minimum salary paid to a single individual.</p>

The death of Sir Surendranath Bannerjea removes from Indian political
life one who has left upon it the deep impress of his own
personality. What though with new ideals and new hopes  withing
recent times he receded into the background? Our present is the
result of our past. Ideals and aspirations of the present day would
have been impossible without the invaluable work done by pioneers
like Sir Surendra. Time was when the student world idolized him, when
his advice was considered indispensable in all national
deliberations, and his eloquence held audiences spell-bound. It is
impossible to recall the stirring events of the partition days in
Bengal and not to think with gratitude and pride of Sir
Surendranath’s matchless services in connection with it. It was
then that Sir Surendranath justly earned from his greatful countrymen
the title of “Surrender-not”. During the blackest period of the
time of partition, Sir Surendranath never wavered, never lost hope.
He threw himself into the agitation with all his might. His
enthusiasm infected the whole of Bengal. His determination to
unsettle the ‘settled fact’ was unshaken. He gave us the
necessary training in courage and resolution. He taught us not to
fear authority. His work in the Education department was no less
valuable than in the political. Through the Ripon College thousands
of young men came under his direct influence and received their
liberal education. His regular habits gave him health, vigour, and,
what may be called for India, a long life. He retained his mental
faculties</p>

order to resume in his seventy-seventh year the editorship of his
paper the <i>Bengalee</i>. Indeed, he was so confident of his mental
vigour and physical capacity, that he said to me, when I had the
privilege of meeting him at Barrackpore two months ago, that he
expected to live till 91 years, after which he would not wish to live
as he would not retain his mental vigour long thereafter. But Fates
had decided otherwise. They snatched him away from us without notice.
For  nobody had expected so sudden a death. Up to the early hours of

dissolution. But though he is no longer with us in the body,  his

The Secretary, A.I.K.B., had circularized all the provinces to send a
list of their khaddar workers with particulars about their
qualifications, work and remuneration. Figures have been received
only from centres in seven provinces, viz., Bihar, U.P., Utkal,
Assam, Maharashtra, Bengal, Kerala and Karnatak, those provinces
where khaddar work on any considerable scale is being done having not
yet sent their figures. Even the facts and figures so far received
from the other provinces are incomplete. Thus, for instance,  Bihar 
reports 32 paid and 2 honorary workers, but the names of some of the
most prominent workers there are to be missed. Many centres have been
mentioned but not Malkhachak. From Bengal only the Abhoy Ashram has
sent  the  list  from  which,  too, the names of Dr. Suresh
Bennerjee, Sjt. Haripad Chatterjea and Annadababu are unaccountably
left out. The Karnatak list does not contain the name of Sjt.

And yet the incomplete and meagre details received have an interest

educational qualifications in some cases have not been shown, the

of undergraduates. The maximum allowance received does not exceed Rs.

Some time ago, I was taken to a magnificent mansion called the
‘Marble Palace’ in Calcutta. It is richly furnished with some
very expensive and some very beautiful paintings. The owners feed, in
the compound in front of the palace, all the beggars who choose to go
there, and I am told that the number every  day  is  several
thousands. This is no doubt a princely charity. It does great credit
to the benevolent spirit of the donors, but  the  incongruity  of 
this ragged humanity feeding whilst the majestic palace is, as it
were, mocking at their wretched condition does not seem to  strike 
the donors at all. Another such painful sight was witnessed by me on
my visit to Suri, where the reception committee had arranged for
feeding the beggars of the district. At the Marble Palace, the crowd
that besieged me passed through the line of baggars eating off their
dusty leaves spread on the gound. Some almost trampled over them. It
was by no means a pleasant spectacle. In Suri it was a little more
decently managed, for the crowd was not to pass through the line of
baggars, but the motor car that drove me to my destination was slowly
taken through the line of the beggars as they were eating. I felt
humiliated, more so to think that this was all done in my honour,
because, as it was put to me by one of the friends there, I was
‘friend of the poor’. My friendship for them must be a sorry
affair if I could be satisfied with a large part of humanity being
reduced to beggary. Little did my friends know that my friendship for
the paupers of India has made me hard-hearted enough  to contemplate
their utter starvation with equanimity in preference to their utter
reduction to beggary. My ashimsa would not tolerate the idea of
giving a free meal to a healthy person who has not worked for it in
some honest way, and if I had the</p>

power I would stop every <i>Sadavarta </i>where free meals are given.
It has degraded the nation and it has encouraged  laziness, 
idleness, hypocrisy and even crime. Such misplaced charity adds
nothing to the wealth of the country, whether material or spiritual,
and gives a false sense of meritoriousness to the donor. How nice and
wise it would be if the donor were to open institutions where they
would give meals under healthy, clean surroundings to men and women
who would work for them. I personally think that the spinning-wheel
or any of the processes that cotton has to go through  will be  an 
ideal occupation. But if they will not have that, they may choose any
other work, only the rule should be: no labour, no meal. Every city
has its own difficult problem of beggars, a problem for which the
monied men are responsible. I know that it is eaiser to fling free
meals in the faces of idlers, but much more difficult to organize an
institution where honest work has to be done before meals are served.
From a pecuniary standpoint, in the initial stages at any rate, the
cost of feeding people after taking work from them will be more than
the cost of the present free kitchens. But I am convinced that it
will be cheaper in the long run, if we do not want to increase in 
geometrical progression the race of loafers which is fast overrunning
this land.</p>

the danger which the correspondent fears may become a stern reality.
There is, however, a clear confusion of thought in the argument. Does
untouchability in the case of a cobbler or scavenger attach to birth
or to occupation? If it attaches to birth, it is hideous and must be
rooted out; if it attaches to occupation, it may be a sanitary rule
of great importance. It is of universal application. A collier,
whilst he  is engaged in his work, is practically an untouchable. He
himself refuses to shake the hand extended to him and says, “I am
too dirty”. But his work finished, he takes his bath, changes his
dress, and very properly mixes with the highest in the land.
Immediately, therefore, we remove the taint of birth, i.e., the idea
of superiority and inferiority attaching to birth, we purify
<i>Varnashrama</i>. The scavenger’s children may remain scavengers
without being or feeling degraded and they will be no more considered
untouchables than Brahmins. The fault does not, therefore, lie in
recognizing the law of heredity and transmission of qualities from
generation to generation, but it lies with the faulty conception of
inequality.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
<i>Varnashrama</i>, in my opinion, was not conceived in any narrow
spirit. On the contrary, it gave the labourer, the Sudra, the same
status as the thinker, the Brahmin. It provided for the accentuation
of merit and elimination of demerit, and it transferred human
ambition from the general worldly sphere to the permanent and the
spiritual. The aim of the Brahmin and the Sudra was common—<i>moksha</i>,
or self- realization—not realization of fame, riches and power.
Later on, this lofty conception of <i>varnashrama </i>became degraded
and came to be identified with mere empty ceremonial and assumption
of superiority by some and imposition fo degradation upon others.
This admission is not a demonstration of the weakness of <i>Varnashrama</i>,
but of human nature which, if it has a tendency under certain
circumstances to rise to the highest point, it has also a tendency
under certain other circumstances to go down to the lowest. What the
reformer seeks to do is to end the curse of untouchability and to
restore <i>Varnashrama</i><i> </i>to its</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
proper place. Whether <i>Varnashrama </i>thus transmuted will survive
the reform or not remains to be seen. It will surely depend upon the
new Brahmin class that is imperceptibly coming into being, namely,
those who are dedicating themselves, body, soul and mind, to service
of Hinduism and the country. If they have nothing of worldly
ambition, it will be well with Hinduism, if they have, Hinduism, like
any other ism, coming into the hands of ambitious men will perish.
But I have an immutable faith in the capacity of Hinduism to purge
itself of all impurities from time to time. I do not think that that
capacity is now exhausted.</p>

to make the best use possible of them so as to be able, by their use

dispelling the ignorance of methods of warfare the letter woefully
betrays. Of course, I have not dealt with currency in the pages of
<i>Young India</i>, as I have not dealt with many other evils of the
present system of Government, e.g., the huge army expenditure. If 
any  writing of mine could possibly remove these gigantic evils, I
would every week recount them and impress the services of friends for
the same purpose so as to be able to say the same thing in a variety
of ways. But those who think like my correspondent should understand
that if the evils we know still persist, they do so not because they
have not been publicly proclaimed or because the rulers do not know
them. Abler men than myself have exposed the wickedness of the
Government currency policy, but the exposure has proved of no avail.
The policy is supported, not by force of reason, but by the ‘sharp
edge of the sword’. I am an economist of time and labour. I believe
in putting before the readers only those things in which they
themselves can, if they will, do something. I do not need to rouse
the feeling of the readers in respect of the evils we are suffereing
from. They feel them daily. But they are helpless. My privilege,
therefore, is to place before them a remedy, or remedies if I can
think of more than one. At the risk, therefore, of being unpopular
and tiresome by reason of repetition, I continue with all the
capacity at my command to tell the reader how we can help to advance
the salvation of this depressed country.</p>

The correspondent is wholly mistaken if he thinks that this country
has to wait, for bringing about exclusion of foreign cloth, for</p>

a phenomenal reduction in the price of khaddar or even of indigenous
mill-cloth. The exclusion will be brought about only when the nation
realizes its national dharma which she must perform, cost what it
may. A good Hindu does not count the cost of performing his <i>Gayatri
</i>or his multitudinous ceremonials. A good Mussalman does not count
the cost of offering his prayers five times a day, neither bargains
for an easier road to heaven. It is the business of the Manchester
merchants to take their calico to the remotest village of India at
the lowest price possible. It is the duty of the villager to reject
it in preference to his ill-made khaddar  which, from a purely
economic point of view, may cost more than the Manchester calico. Why
should we think that any agitation on our part will induce the
Manchester merchants to become so philanthropic as to waive the
facilities by way of currency and otherwise which they can command
from the Government of their own making? Will an Indian merchant
similarly placed do otherwise than what his Manchester brother is
doing today? The only agitation, therefore, that is relevant and
effective is the generation of some kind of force that will
effectively prevent the dumping down of Manchester and other foreign
cloth on the sacred soil of India. My correspondent must be an
indifferent reader of <i>Young India</i>, or he should have known
that I am not indifferent to the mill industry of my country. I
proclaim on every relevent occasion that I want all the protection
that I can secure for the industry, and that, if I had the power, I
would impose a prohibitive tariff on all foreign cloth. But there my
duty ends. The mill industry stands in no need of other support from
me. It has capital, it has agents who take its manufactures to all
parts of India. It is well able to take care of itself.
Unfortunately, it is timid and not national. It thinks in terms of
profits of its few shareholders. It takes no note of the masses who
are the purchasers of its manufactures. Khaddar is no enemy to that
industry. Khaddar is its infant brother standing in need of delicate
nursing—all the protection that a loving nurse can extend to it.
It, therefore, commands my exclusive attention and I endeavour to
enlist it from others. When it has grown to maturity, and not
before,will be the time to consider the rival claims of the big
brother— the mill industry. Only a little clear thinking is
required to perceive that rehabilitation of khaddar necessarily means
protection for the indigenous mill industry for perhaps a generation
to come. But if out of our ignorance we fail to concentrate upon
khaddar, not only is</p>

The following report received from the Secretary of the All- India 
Khaddar Board will be read with the greatest interest:<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The report does not only show us how much work has been possible in a
year’s time amongst the villagers through the simple
instrumentality of the spinning population. But what is more striking
is a comparison between the figures regarding the earnings from
hand-spinning and from agriculture. These figures dispel the idea
once for all about the insignificance of the wages received from
hand- spinning by professional spinners. The lowest income from the
charkha is 14% of the other income, but in some individual families
the percentage is as high as 66. The reader will not fail to note too
how other reforms naturally come in side by side with spinning. The
foregoing report refers to temperance work. In many places in Bengal
I have noticed that those who are interested in introducing spinning
amongst the villagers took up medical relief as a matter of course
and, if they do not touch the other departments of life in the
villages, it is not because of want of will, but because the workers
are too few, and the villagers too conservative to respond merely for
the asking. What is true of the villages<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>examined
in Tamil Nadu is   equally  true  of many villages in Bengal. My
enquiries have led to the discovery that thousands of cultivators
make no more than Rs. 7 to 8 per month during the year. An addition
of Rs. 2/- out of spinning done only by the family members is a very
substantial relief for these poor cultivators.</p>

	I like your business-like letter. Here is my reply. There should be
	no hurry.You will find enough work with the spinning-wheel. You need
	not think of attracting all classes at once. I should not start
	Hindu Sabhas, at least for the time being. Conducting a school and
	giving medical relief may well form part of a spinning organization,
	so far as they help spinning. If workers engage in paying
	industries, they cannot give exclusive attention to spinning. But if
	to spinning you add weaving, you make your institution financially
	self- supporting in the end. During the interval, you must expect
	the nation to find livelihood for the workers who give their whole
	time to the development of spinning. You must not think of having

missionaries. You are yourselves working in villages. To make people
self-reliant, fearless, self-supporting, resourceful and healthy is
to make them keep swaraj always in view. There is nothing in the name
swaraj apart from the qualities I have mentioned. Philanthropic
societies exclude the idea of political freedom. You do not exclude
it, neither do you parade it to raise false notions.</p>

You may seek help from district boards and the like for your work so
long as you are not called upon to sacrifice your freedom. Villagers’
non-co-operation consists in modelling their lives, so far as
practicable, independently of Government. They need not go to law-
courts if they will not quarrel, and if they will submit to
arbitration.They need not send their children to Government schools.</p>

If the workers have the spirit of real non-violent non-co- operation,
they will infect the villagers with it, not by speech but by their
conduct.</p>

I would not be a party to voluntarily sending any boy to a Government
school. National schools, imperfect though they may be, must be
encouraged, but here again no boy need be prevented by any mechanical
contrivance from going to a Government school. It is nouse his
refraining unless he feels the indignity himself.</p>

With profound feelings of sorrow, this meeting of the citizens of
Calcutta, representative of all parties and all communities, desires
to place on record its deep and abiding sense of the loss sustained
by the country by the demise of Sir Surendranath Banerjea, Kt., the
high priest of Indian nationalism. His undaunted and unremitting
labours for the last 50 years in the service of the motherland, fired
with the warmth of apostolic fervour, constitute an  unparalleled
record  of noble endeavour and high achievement which will ever
remain enshrined in the grateful recollections of his countrymen and
be a source of unfailing inspiration to the nation he served. This
meeting tenders its respectful homage to his adored memory, and
conveys its deep sympathy to the members of the bereaved family in
their great loss.</p>

heroes of the nation—services they rendered before many of us were
born. It makes not the slightest difference that we may not see eye
to eye with such illustrious men. If they had not laid the
foundation, we would not have been able to build; if they had not
laid the foundation, we would not have been able to do what we are

forthcoming—an example in courage, an example in sacrifice, an
example in diplomacy—not the diplomacy of the mean sort which is so
much in vogue today. I am talking of that diplomacy which every
nation requires, which every individual requires. Let us think of his
services of those days, let us treasure the memory of the great deeds
wrought by men like Sir Surendranath whom the nation in its
admiration called ‘Surrender-not’. And is it not true? Was not
the title deserved by him during those dark but brilliant days of
Partition? Was he not able, through the assistance of Bengal behind
him and the whole of India, to unsettle the ‘settled fact’? Was
he not able to do many things of which we, the present generation,
have every reason to be proud? Let</p>

ourselves, forget the great services of the great heroes. Let us
shed, therefore, tears over the ashes of Sir Surendranath. But let us
do a little better. Let us follow some of the things which it is
given to every one of us today. We may not have his eloquence,
probably not one of us has his great memory, but every one of us can
imitate his love of the land, every one of us can imitate his
unfailing regularity. Until the other day, when I had the honour of
waiting upon him at Barrackpore, he told me that the secret of his
health and the secret of his vitality was his unfailing regularity. I
remember in 1901, when an important meeting was going on, the meeting
could not be finished. Sir Surendranath apologized and said,
“Gentlemen, I must catch my last train for Barrackpore.” Sir
Surendranath could not wait for the meeting. The meeting had to be
postponed for Sir  Surendranath. What did he do ? He kept his time
not from selfish motives, but he did so for the sake of the nation he
loved so much. Let us, therefore, remember these constructive
virtues. What has he not done for the education of Bengal! Was he not
at one time the idol of young men of Bengal? Let us imitate him in
the love of the motherland; every one of us, man, woman or child, all
of us can imitate.</p>

There are many more things, but one thing I must not omit because it
is a treasured memory. When I was with him at Barrackpore, he said to
me, “I am going to live till 91 years. I am now preparing the
second edition of my reminiscences. I am going to give many a battle
to the Government,  many  a  battle  to the Swarajists. I shall  be
engaged in all these things. But do you know what is the nearest to
my heart?”“I don’t know,” said I.“I belong,” replied Sir
Surendranath, “to the school of Vidyasagar. You will find it
written in the first page of my book. If I had to rewrite the whole
of my life, what do you think I would do? I would serve the neglected
widow. I would repair the fortunes of many a broken home. I cannot
bear the sight of innocent children having widowhood enforced upon
them.” Let the young men of Bengal remember their little innocent
sisters. I hear such cases from every side of Bengal. Bengal is no
exception, things are going the same all over India. A case was
brought to my notice only last night. I do not want to detain you on
that case. I simply mention this thing to enable the young men of
Bengal to understand what it is that we have to do.</p>

education of this class. The labourers that the writer refers to are
not those employed in mills. Theirs is a different tale. These facts
relate to labourers employed in masonry work, etc. That class will
continue to exist so long as the world lasts. The only safeguard for
them is in education. There is no reason why they should offer
bribes, there is no reason why they should remain suppressed. Their
ignorance and weakness are the reasons why they offer bribes, remain
suppressed, witness or perform licentious acts. Neither the
spinning-wheel nor weaving offers any remedy for this. These can help
a little, but they cannot impart knowledge to these labourers. The
correspondent himself shows weakness. If he is able to feed his
mother and educate his brother only on condition that he is a witness

The Jallianwala Bagh Fund<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

though not to ten. Pandit Malaviyaji, the jewel of India, was its
very soul. Its accounts up to the last pie have been published many
times. They have been brought out as a booklet and have also been
published in newspapers. A part of the fund has been used for the
purchase of a piece of land, in which there is today a beautiful
well-maintained garden. And if the project has gone no further,
perhaps I am mainly responsible for it. The hopes we entertained when
it was conceived are there no longer. It is only when communal
disputes are settled that some form of a fitting memorial can be
built there. The reader will be sorry to learn that today even that
garden has become a bone of contention. I dare not spend the money in
building a useless memorial. If a proper building is not constructed

The largest fund was the Tilak Swaraj Fund. It too has been severely
criticized. Its accounts were maintained fully and are still there.
They have been published in the form of a book. The accounts have
been examined by auditors. I am firmly convinced that that fund has
been least mismanaged. It may be said that it was not used very
intelligently. This, however, was inevitable. In this first attempt
to use a large sum of money through an organization the lack of
competence was less than is usually found. The reason for this was
the constant vigilance on the part of the secretary and the
treasurer. There has not been as much written off here as in a

me, however, talk only of the funds now. I have no desire,
whatsoever, to collect any more funds in addition to these. Whether
the totalamounts to 10 lakhs or not, contributions from Bengal will
be discontinued at the end of this month. I made a small beginning in
Jamshedpur for the All-India memorial.The sum of Rs.  5,000 collected

thousand. Another sum of Rs. 500 donated by a Gujarati gentelman and
a sum of Rs. 500 donated by a Sikh gentleman will also be credited to
the latter fund. The only reason for doing so is that Jamshedpur is
in Bihar.The ten lakhs to be contributed by Bengal should be
collected from Bengal and from Bengalis living in other provinces. If
other Indians of their own accord send money for this purpose, it
will not be refused.This, however, can not be insisted upon. And,

Jamshedpur was originally called Sakchi. It is in the province of
Bihar. Born of the vision of Jamshedji Tata it has become one of the
largest iron producers in the world. This place was formerly an

after another, however, prevented me from doing so. On this occasion,
too I would have been unable to go had Andrews not urged me to go
there for the sake of the labourers. Andrews and persons like him
make me helpless and drag me along according to their wishes. Hence,
I went to Jamshedpur and stayed there for two days.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
However, what can one see of such a large factory in two days ?  I
could not see a single thing well. I myself am a labourer and went
there to serve the labourers. Nevertheless I have been unable to get
any idea of the living conditions of the labourers. What could I find
out until I had seen their homes, their courtyards, and so on.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Nevertheless, what follows will convey my impression: The climate is
good; there is very good water supply. The houses presented a good
appearance from outside.To all appearances, people seemed to be
happy. The roads looked well built. Mr. Andrews is the president of
the labour union.Three outstanding matters were resolved after a
little discussion,viz., that the company should recognize the labour
union, that the latter could freely elect its own leaders, that Mr.
Shethi could continue to be the secretary of the union and that Mr.
Ratan Tata should arrange to re-employ him in the company. If the
labourers would apply in writing, the company would, within a period
that it found suitable,pay their dues directly to the union by
deducting them from wages. The union must primarily assume the
responsibility to improve the conditions of the labourers themselves.
The company has gained in credit by accepting these demands. The
labourers now have to play their part.</p>

I have your letter. I approve of the first plan but we have to think
more about it. I hope to reach the Ashram on the 5th. I must return
on the 9th. But during those four days it would be good if some of us
got together. I am afraid that the happy  ones  would benefit from
our leniency whereas the unhappy ones might be left out. The wheel
will, we reckon, put an end to the misery of  the unhappy people.
Proverty is increasing, we believe, in Kathiawar. If that is not
true, we will have to think over it again. We should keep two things
in mind.We should make khadi so cheap that the poor too can wear it
and those who are hard up for even one pice should be given the
spinning-wheel and work. The third point is that even if we stop
giving bonus after a certain period the work should not stop. We can
only discuss all this only when we meet.</p>

	come to represent the potency of the wheel, the spinning-wheel or 
	the  spindle I hold in my hand (showing a little instrument), and I
	have so often humorously said to my mill-owning friends that I
	propose to compete with them with this little spindle. But beyond

	India is 1,900 miles long from north to south and 1,500 milesbroad
	from east to west and it includes 700,000 villages over this vast 
	surface. The majority of the villages are not served by any railway

tell us is nothing less than 85 per cent.The Government statistics
also tell us that this 85 per cent of the population of India has at
least four months in the year absolutely idle. Some of them who are
in the know tell me that in Bengal there are agriculturists who have
nothing to do for six months in the year. You can imagine what will
happen to a man who takes four months’ or six months’ holiday
without pay. Not even the Viceroy of India can afford that vacation.
Besinessmen, I think, even though they may be millionaries never give
themselves all that holiday and do no business. Much less can this
vast agricultural population which the historian of India, the late
Sir William Hunter, told us 30 years ago was living a hand-to-mouth
existence. He said that one-tenth of the population of India was
living on one meal only per day and that meal consisted of dry bread
and a pinch of dirty salt. They did not know what milk or ghee was.
Nor did they get any vegetables.</p>

As you know, famine is chronic in India, It is a money famine. I
suggest to you, as business people, that for such people a
supplementary occupation is an absolute necessity, and if it is an
absolute necessity it must fulfil certain conditions to apply to this
vast mass of mankind. It must, therefore, be a universal occupation.
It must be an occupation whose products can be easily taken over by
the whole of the population. Therefore it will be idle to suggest
that they should make articles of luxury. It must be one that they
could easily learn.If it requires a good deal of skill or if the
instrument of production requires a great manufacturing skill or if
it was expensive, it would not answer.</p>

The correspondent might have added theTilak Swaraj Fund, and also the
Flood Relief Fund in the South.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The question is pertinent. Even in course of my collection for the
Deshbandhu Memorial, those who have paid me handsomely have given me
the caution. My general rule is that I never identify myself with any
fund where I do not know those who are to operate upon it, and where
I am not satisfied about their honesty. The first three funds were
raised not by me, or on the strength of any reputation I possess, but
they were raised by Mr. Banker, whom even then I knew well and who
had a perfect right to use my name. I know, too, that he could have
raised all the money that was received on the strength of his own
undoubted reputation and service rendered. Fullest accounts were kept
of the receipts and disbursements, and were published also, if my
recollection serves me right. But, in any event, these are very small
accounts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
I have referred to the Tilak Swaraj Fund, although my correspondent
has not. I have heard repeated complaints about it. It was the
biggest public fund ever raised. I have the clearest conscience about
it. The closest scrutiny of the disposal of that fund will show that
generally there has been no laxity about its administration, and that
there have been far less losses than are incurred by commercial</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
firms. The latter generally write off 10 p.c. as their book-debts. I
have known big South African firms writing off so much as 25 p.c. as
a normal thing. In the transactions on the Tilak Swaraj Fund, we have
not lost anything near 10 p.c. I doubt if the total losses would
amount to 2 p.c. The working treasurer insisted upon vouchers for
everything. The accounts have been audited from time to time. They
have been published. This is not to say that in some cases there has
not been gross misappropriation by Congress workers who were
entrusted with funds. This is inevitable where monies have to be
disbursed through hundreds of channels. All that is possible is to
ensure against the looseness or carelessness on the part of top men.
The wonder to me is that, on the whole, it is possible to show as
clean a record as we have.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Then take the Jallianwala Bagh Fund. Here, again, there is accurate
account-keeping. The accounts have been published  also from time to
time. The place is well looked after. Pandit Malavyaji may be
considered to be the soul of that fund. The place is kept beautifully
clean, and from a dung-heap it has been turned into a garden.
Complaints, however, have been made that no fitting memorial has yet
been raised, and the money is allowed to lie idle. If it is a charge,
I must confess that I am perhaps more answerable for it than the
others. Even plans have been prepared, but I felt that conditions of
the time when the fund was raised were altered immediately after. The
Bagh itself has been in some way or other, a bone of contention
between different parties. I do not know that we have seen the last
of it. The Memorial was to be, as it should be, a memorial of solid
communal unity—a triumph out of a tragedy. Hindu, Mussalman and
Sikh blood that flowed on that fateful 13th in a mingled stream was
to signify an unbreakable union. Where is that union today? It will
be time to think of building a memorial when we stand united. For the
present, so far as I am concerned, it is enough that the Bagh stands,
as a little bit of a lung in crowded Amritsar, with its narrow,
tortuous and dirty lanes.</p>

Now, I come to the Deshbandhu Memorial Fund. The treasurer of the
fund is a host in himself. But I know that he will not be forever
possessed of it. It will ultimately vest in the trustees. The five
original trustees are nominees of the deceased patriot. Every one of
them has a status in society, and a reputation to lose. Some of them
are monied men. These five original trustees have added two more.
They are, again, men connected not with one public trust but many.
One of</p>

them, Sir Nilratan Sircar, is the premier physician of Calcutta, and
the other, Mr. S. R. Das, the first cousin of the deceased, is the
Advocate- General of Bengal. If these seven trustees are not capable
of rendering a good account of themselves, and doing justice to the
trust reposed in them, I should despair of any trust succeeding in
India. The mansion is there, and I know that Dr. Bidhan Chandra Roy,
another medical trustee and a physician of the first rank is busy
evolving plans for putting it to the use for which it is intended. It
has been whispered to me that possibly Mr. S. R. Das, being the
Advocate-General of Bengal, cannot be trustee. I do not know the law
in the matter. I knew that he was Advocate-General of Bengal when he
undertook the trust; but if it is an oversight, there will be a
trustee appointed in his place who will be equal in reputation to
him. If Mr. S. R. Das can remain a trustee, I was privileged to know
enough of him to be able to assure the readers that he will neglect
nothing to make the administration of the trust athorough success. Up
to the moment of his departure for England, it occupied his care and
attention. But I feel sure that every one of the original trustees
will be as jealous of the memory of the deceased as any can be, and
that they will make the proposed hospital and nurses’ training
institution worthy of his memory. So much for the  All-  Bengal
Deshbandhu Memorial Fund.</p>

About the All-India Memorial Fund, I am myself one of the trustees.
The object of the Memorial is nearest to my heart. My fellow-trustees
are as well known to the public as any public men. The Secretary is a
seasoned soldier, and so is the treasurer,  both respectively
Secretary and Treasurer of the Congress also.</p>

Let me, however, in conclusion, warn the public that the safety of
the public fund lies more even in an intelligent vigilance of the
public than in the strict integrity of those who are in charge of
funds. Absolute honesty of the trustees is a necessity, but public
inertia is a crime. Ignorant criticism must not be mistaken for 
intelligent vigilance. What I have found generally is ignorant
criticism.What I would love to see is, that some public men, with a
knowledge of account-keeping, make it a point, now and again, of
overhauling the administration of public funds, an bringing the 
administrators  to book.</p>

When I was a youth, I remember a Hindu having become a convert to
Christianity. The whole town understood that the initiation took the
shape of this well-bred Hindu partaking of beef and brandy in the
name of Jesus Christ and discarding his national costume. I learnt in
later years, that such a convert, as so many of my missionary friends
put it, came to a life of freedom out of a life of bondage, to a life
of plenty out of one of penury. As I wander about throughout the
length and breadth of India I see many Christian Indians almost
ashamed of their birth, certainly of their ancestral religion, and of
their ancestral dress. The aping of Europeans on the part of Anglo-
Indians is bad enough, but the aping of them by Indian converts is a
violence done to their country and, shall I say, even to their new
religion. There is a verse in the New Testament to bid Christians
avoid meat if it would offend their neighbours. Meat here, I 
presume, includes drink and dress. I can appreciate uncompromising
avoidance of all that is evil in the old, but where there is not only
no question of anything evil but where an ancient practice may be
even desirable, it would be a crime to part with it when one knows
for certain that the giving up would deeply hurt relatives and
friends.Conversion must not mean denationalization. Conversion should
mean a definite giving up of the evil of the old, adoption of all the
good of the new and a scrupulous avoidance of everything evil in the
new. Conversion, therefore, should mean a life of greater dedication
to one’s own country, greater surrender to God, greater
self-purification. Years ago  I met the late Kali Charan Banerjee.
Had I not known before I went there that he was a Christian, I should
certainly not have noticed from the appearance of his home that he
was one. It was no different from an ordinary modern Hindu
home,—simple and meagre in furniture.</p>

The great man was dressed like an ordinary un-European and Hindu
Bengali. I know that there is a marvellous change coming over
Christian Indians. There is on the part of a large number of them a
longing to revert to original simplicity, a longing to belong to the
nation and to serve it, but the process is too slow. There need be no
waiting. It requires not much effort, but I was told, and even as I
write, I have a letter from a Christian Indian before me telling me
that he and his friends find it difficult to make the change, because
of the opposition of their superiors. Some of them tell me that they
are even jealously watched, and any movement on their part to
identify themselves with national movements is strongly condemned.
The late  Principal  Rudra  and  I  used  often to discuss this evil
tendency.  I well remember how  he  used to deplore it. I am offering
a tribute  to the memory of a dead friend when I inform the reader
that he used often to express his grief that it was too late in life
for him to change some of the unnecessary European habits to which he
was brought up. Is it not truely deplorable that many Christian
Indians discard their own mother tongue, bring up their children only
to  speak in English? Do they not thereby completely cut themselves
adrift from the nation in whose midst they have to live? But they may
answer in self-defence that many Hindu and even Mussalmans have
become denationalized. The <i>tu </i><i>quoqu</i>e argument serves no
useful purpose. I am writing not as a critic but as a friend who has
enjoyed for the past thirty years the closest intimacy with  hundreds
 of Christian Indians. I want my missionary friends and Christian
Indians to reciprocate the spirit in which these lines are written. I
write in the name and for the sake of heart-unity which I want to see
established among the people of this land professing different
faiths. In nature there is a fundamental unity running through all
the diversity we see about us. Religions are no exception to the
natural law. They are given to mankind so as to accelerate the
process of realization of fundamental unity.</p>

The travelling wheel of the Khadi Pratishthan has solved the question
of providing an efficient travelling spinning-wheel. I have been
using one for the last three months with the greatest satisfaction.</p>

It yields as much to me as the ordinary charkha. I therefore use the
same thing, whether at home or travelling. I have been able to use it
in a moving train also. It is lighter than the ordinary wheel, and
the principle of construction is the same. Success has been attained
by making the wheel collapsible. When it is put away, it is an
elegant and handy little box, capable of being carried without any
effort. Its dimensions when packed up are 16”x6”x6” and the
weight is 7 lb. The wheel is made of steel wires. It takes no more
than two to three minutes to put it up, and no more to pack it up. By
suspending the spindle inside the uprights, rather than the outside,
the motion becomes perfectly noiseless and easier. There is also less
danger of the spindle being bent. Holders are made of pieces of gut
collected out of the breakage of carding guts and, therefore, cost
nothing. The guts are held in position by wedges being driven from
outside into the  receiving poles made in the uprights.The box can
accommodate an oil can, simple tools, slivers, etc.The price of this
wheel is Rs. 15. Satis Babu informs me that it is possible for him to
supply a few only of these charkhas at a time. I bring it to the
notice of the readers only for the sake of those who would not
suspend their spinning while travelling. I meet so many who give
their constant travelling as an excuse for not spinning. This
travelling wheel removes any  such ground for excuse.</p>

I can say is that I am surprised at the resignation. Evidently,</p>

all of Dr.Suhrawardy’s grievance is purely against me, but I am not
a member of the Swaraj Party. He may express all the resentment that
he wishes to against me regarding the opinion that I gave at  the
meeting to which I was invited. But that was my own personal opinion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
So far as I am concerned, I still hold that it was wrong on his part,
as it would be wrong on the part of any member of the Swaraj party,
to see His Excellency the Governor on the eve of an election which
was to be contested on party lines, and in which one like Dr.
Suhrawardy stood as the party candidate.</p>

I cannot, therefore, help saying that it is a healthy rule to
prohibit members of the Swaraj Party from meeting or seeing officials
without the permission of the Party. Many things have been known to
take place at so-called social functions, but as I have said, this is
my personal opinion which the Swaraj Party may or may not endorse.</p>

If it is not too late for Dr. Suhrawardy, I would strongly advise him
to be content with venting his anger against me, and to remain in the
Party to which he has professed loyalty, especially after the death
of the Deshbandhu, whose memory he rightly reveres.</p>

As I have promised to go to Kutch, residents of Kutch have been
asking me about the time of my visit and what are my expectations

been to Kutch, though I have all along wanted to go there. The second
reason is that a promise is like a debt, which should be discharged
at the earliest opportunity. However, I do not think that I shall now

	Having seen my advice on taking legal steps in cases where the funds
	of khadi boards were misappropriated by the members of the Congress
	itself, a gentleman suggests that justice should be sought through
	the good offices of the <i>panch </i>and also that the idea of the
	<i>panch </i>should be propagated among the people. The idea
	underlying the <i>panch </i>is very dear to me, but those who have
	been guilty are not likely to accept the verdict of the <i>panch</i>.
	A thief, one finds, yields to punishment; so does a rogue. There is
	no element of non-violence in letting off either of these types
	because of our lack  of strength. Society has not reached a stage
	where the practice of  punishing persons can be given up.Today, such
	non-violence seems to  be possible only for individuals. Even among
	individuals, only those who have altogether renounced material
	possessions can afford to give up all recourse to punishments. In
	the present case, both those who borrowed money and those who stood
	guarantee for them have failed to repay the sums borrowed from the
	Khadi Board. The Board has only one way open to it, and that is to
	recover the amount even by going to a court of law. A realistic
	interpretation of the <i>Gita </i>too leads to the same conclusion.

Arjuna who had used weapons throughout his life? The very fact that
he made preparations for the battle showed that he had to fight it.
It was his dharma to fight and defend the faith of his age.
Similarly, as soon as the Khadi Board lent out public funds it became
its dharma to recover the sums by taking the guarantors, etc., to a
court of law if the latter proved unworthy. The idea of the <i>panch
</i>can only function where both parties are prepared to respect its
decision. That respect is as good as non-existent now. In this case
all that we can do is to go to the law-courts, always being prepared
to abide by decisions of the <i>panch </i>and making efforts to
re-establish the institution. However, before the idea of the <i>panch
</i>is generally accepted, many individuals will have to practise
penance and purify themselves. Let us do this to the best of our
ability.</p>

its price would have been higher. The poorest readers of <i>Navajivan

supplies some poor persons with copies at a reduced price or even
free of charge. This correspondent should carefully preserve his own
copy and have it bound himself. The ability to preserve the smallest
things with care is included among the fine characteristics of
virtuous poverty. <i>Navajivan </i>is thrifty to the extent that some
people work for it, spending money out of their own pockets.</p>

and is content with merely reading it. Some owners add to  their
wealth, others lose it. Some promote morality, others help its
decline. Some make you laugh, others make you cry; some pull you
towards swaraj, others push you towards foreign rule. It is clear
that the ownership of <i>Navajivan </i>brings no wealth. It is clear
on the other hand that its ownership makes the subscribers poorer.
But is there anything suprising in this? Should I not be regarded as
its principal owner? I have to buy stamps from other departments for
posting articles for <i>Navajivan</i>. Sometimes, I have to send even
telegrams. I can give at least this assurance to the subscribers that
I have to spend more than what they do. And, I am not the only one
who has to do so. My other colleagues are also in a similar
predicament. And is it not sufficient that one applies the same rule
to oneself that one applies to others? The subscribers have no more
responsibility after paying the annual subscription. What, however,
is the plight of the honorary manager- <i>cum</i>-proprietor? To buy
<i>Navajivan </i>is to take the road of swaraj, to chant the praises
of the spinning-wheel. To sell it is to deal in truth and
non-violence. I have no desire, whatsoever, to offer other
temptations in order to find subscribers.</p>

I still maintain that <i>Navajivan </i>is not a means of making
money. Fifty thousand rupees may be regarded as money earned if the
organizers make use of that amount. There are five thousand
subscribers of <i>Navajivan </i>today; previously there were 30,000.
If <i>Navajivan </i>can attract the same number of subscribers again,
I would not reduce its price but rather resume using the one pice
saved per subscriber for public welfare and look upon its
subscriber-owners as having gained something in this way.</p>

I did not conceive the plan of having cheap publications. The
manager<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>of
the press conceived it, although it is being carried out with my
approval. Such publishing activity would certainly appeal to me. When
the press had less work to do for the weeklies, this scheme came into
being with the idea that it would have at least some work in its
spare time. In doing so, the press receives payment at the market
rate and, in return, undertakes to shoulder the entire responsibility
free of any charge, the subscribers of <i>Navajivan </i>do not have
to do so. Consequently, it is but proper that only those who are the
customers of the Mandir get the benefit of the reduced price. Those
who have been subscribing to <i>Navajivan </i>for the last six years
have gained a lot by way of the weekly reading material they get.</p>

better way is not to rely on testimonials given by others but to

<i>TEMPLES FOR THE UNTOUCHABLES</i></h1>

I have already expressed my views regarding temples for the
untouchables. In my opinion the value of all temples is determined by
the penance that underlies them. For instance, if a licentious or
cruel man builds temples at various places in order to help or hide
his sins, they do not acquire sancity because they have the name or
form of temples. As against this, if a few devout persons put in
their own labour, build a hut of mud and straw, install an image and
constantly meditate there, this would be a place of pilgrimage as
compared to the jewel-studded edifice called a temple raised by the
loose liver. Following the same line of thought, I believe that
temples for the untouchables would be worth while only if  our 
untouchable  brothers contributed the largest share in the form of
labour, in building these. I gave such advice to our untouchable
brothers and sisters  in  Lathi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
   </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
 they  have  acted  on  it  too.  They  contributed money and
ornaments at that very meeting. I suggested the following conditions:
The State should contribute a sum equal to that collected by our
untouchable brothers. I should raise an amount equal to these two
amounts put together. A trust should be formed for the temple,
consisting of one trustee representing the untouchables, one
representing the State and a third representing me. If this is done
the temple would have a good organization, some sentiment would
attach to it and our untouchable brothers would have the facility to
practise</p>

kept in view. I hope that the untouchable brothers of Lathi have not
given up efforts begun by them.</p>

The correspondent who has posed the question appearing in today’s
leading article has also, in that very letter, asked some other
separate questions which I quote below:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.99cm; margin-top: 0.17cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Was
it not a mistake on the part of Pandit Malaviyaji not to accept the
offer held out by the State of Alwar, allowing him to carry out alone
an independent inquiry? Is it not unworthy of a leader of the status
of Panditji to forgo the opportunity for investigation that was
granted to him, by being cowed down because of the financial
assistance offered by the State, relinquishing one’s duty and
hesitating to show his courage publicly?</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; line-height: 110%">
What I wrote about Panditji was based on what I had read in the
newspapers. The correspondent has hastily formed a wrong opinion.
Panditji did not get permission to go and investigate in Alwar. The
officials of the Alwar Ruler have acted much like General Dyer and
the Ruler, by preventing a public inquiry, has acted in an autocratic
manner and has taken the shine out of his crown. Panditji is not such
a coward as to forgo the opportunity for investigating if it is given
to him. No one should imagine even in his dreams that Panditji would
sell his soul for the sake of money.</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">I
find the following suggestion of yours to be improper, viz., that a
husband and wife should tolerate each other’s dharma even if they
are opposed and in order to do so the husband should even get foreign
clothes for her. If the wife disobeys the husband, under what law
should the latter obey the former? In the case of a reformed couple
who drink liquor, if the husband gives it up later and asks his wife
to do likewise, should he obtain it for her if she refuses to give it
up? You yourself have often compared burning of foreign cloth
withgiving up liquor, why then do you give such advice? Is this not
the very opposite of knowledge? The husband may possibly get for her
Indian mill-made clothes but certainly not foreign ones.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.29cm; line-height: 0.4cm">
The dharma of the husband and the wife towards each other is</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-top: 0.01cm">full of

easy one. The children of a suppressed woman would also be likewise
suppressed. A devotee of khadi has to tolerate the foreign clothes of
others; he should similarly tolerate those of his wife. Supposing my
wife and I are meat-eaters; later I become purified and give up meat.
Must my wife, therefore, give it up too? Or, should I persuade her
and reason with her, asking her to give it up? Supposing I force her
to give it up and later crave for meat, should my wife start eating
meat again? How is widowhood any worse than having one’s husband
alive under such circumstances? Even Mandodari,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>who
was the wife of a demon enjoyed   freedom. Draupadi used to scold the
Pandavas. Even a husband like  Bhima<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4
</font></sup>became meek in front of Draupadi. What could we not say
of Sita’s husband? Rama was worshipped because of Sita. No force
can be used in the matter of dharma. Dharma is like the edge of a
sword. Shri Krishna’s words “what action should one perform” 
should be construed as “what dharma should one pursue”. Even the
poets, that is learned men, have yielded to the fascination of
searching for its import. I am a true devotee of khadi and yet
believe that I have no right to force my wife to take to khadi. The
mutual love of husband and wife is not something gross. Through it
one gets a glimpse of the love of the soul for God. Such love can 
never be sensual.  Only animals yield to their senses. We call it
animal behaviour. Force has no place where there is pure love. Where
there is pure love each respects the beliefs of the other and both go
forward on the path of dharma.</p>

seemed a simple word, but it meant the organization of the whole of
India, inasmuch as India was predominantly rural. Sir Henry Maine had
left a work on Village Communities which everyone might treasure. He
had shown to India and to the world that the village life of India
today was what it was five thousand years ago, which did not imply
that the Indians were barbarous. On the contrary, the writer had made
it clear that the Indian village life had so much vitality and
character that it had persisted all these long years and weathered
many a storm. He had described these villages as so many village
republics completely self- contained, having all that one may
want—schools, arbitration boards, sanitation boards, and no Poor
Law, indeed, but ample provision for the relief of the poor.</font></font></p>

personality. To him the village headman was a personality in himself.
He was not the impostor of today; he was the servant of the people
whom they could go to in times of difficulties, whom every child in
the village knew and loved. He was incorruptible, he was a gentleman.

I say go with your character to the villages and express  it through
some loving act of service or kindness. It will be instinctively
understood and responded to. Let any young man who  has  a  character
to save venture out to the villages and he will get a response. But
he will have to be patient and truthful. There is no character where
there is no patience and truth and gentleness and humility. He will
not go out as a patron saint of the villages, he will have to go in
humility with a broom-stick in his hand. There is a Trinity of Evil—
insanitation, poverty and idleness—that you will have to be faced
with and you will fight them with broom-sticks, quinine and castor
oil and, if you will believe me, with the spinning-wheel. But all
these will not help you without character.You must come down from
your high pedestals, stoop to conquer, take the risk of catching
malaria yourself. This work will give you all the satisfaction that
your soul can desire. It will enrich the villagers’ life and your
life.</p>

cow-killing was strongest in Bihar and United Provinces. It is a
problem from the past, requiring a life’s study of several workers.
He wanted the members to take up this work on the lines suggested. He
was not a specialist in the line and could not undertake such work
himself. He kept an open mind and would give his attention to all
suggestions of a practical nature.</font></font></p>

Society met Gandhiji at 148, Russa Road, at 3.30 p.m. Earlier they
had sent him the text of a lecture by Major Owen Berkely Hill,
Superintendent of the Ranchi European Mental Hospital, who had
observed that the efforts hitherto made in uniting the Hindus and
Muslims had failed because “the uncosconscious factor” involved
in the problem had been neglected. The cow in his opinion was a
“totem” for the Hindus, and as such was the repository of
unconscious ambivalent feelings. When a cow was killed a large amount
of his repressed emotion was let loose and was responsible for the
trouble. He suggested that if a suitable symbolic animal could be
devised, and if Hindus and Muslims could meet on a common platform,
and participate in the sacrifice of this symbol, the tension could be
relieved. The members of the Society sought Gandhiji’s views on
this thesis.</font></font></p>

I have a correspondent who always brings me to book for the slightest
negligence on my part. He is evidently a regular student of <i>Young
India</i>, but no blind admirer. Here is a candid but friendly
critic, and, if he sees something good in my writings, he detects
also errors. One of his letters drawing attention to a possible
inconsistency in my writings has long remained in my file. One
portion of it deals with the definition of ‘<i>sanatana </i>Hindu’.

I am not a literalist. Therefore, I try to understand the spirit of
the various scriptures of the world. I apply the test of Truth and
Ahimsa laid down by these very scriptures for interpretation. I
reject what is inconsistent with that test, and I appropriate all
that  is consistent with it. The story of a Sudra having been
punished by Ramachandra for daring to learn the Vedas I reject as an</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
interpolation. And in any event, I worship Rama, the perfect being of
my conception, not a historical person, facts about whose life may
vary with the progress of new historical discoveries and researches.
Tulsidas had nothing to do with the Rama of history. Judged by
historical test, his <i>Ramayana </i>would be fit for the scrap heap.
As a spiritual experience, his book is almost unrivalled, at least
for me. And then too, I do not swear by every word that is to be
found in so many editions published as the <i>Ramayana </i>of
Tulsidas. It is the spirit running through the book that holds me
spell-bound. I cannot myself subscribe to the prohibition against
Sudras  learning  the  Vedas. Indeed, in my opinion, at the present
moment, we are  all predominantly Sudras so long as we are serfs.
Knowledge cannot be the prerogative of any class or section. But I
can conceive the impossibility of people assimilating higher or
subtler truths, unless they have undergone preliminary training, even
as those who have not made preliminary prepartaions are quite unfit
to breathe the rarefied atmosphere in high altitudes, or those who
have no preliminary training in simple mathematics are unfit to
understand or assimilate higher geometry or algebra. Lastly, I
believe in certain healthy conventions. There is a convention
surrounding the recitation of the <i>Gayatri</i>. The convention is
that it should be recited only at stated times and after ablutions
performed in the prescribed manner. As I believe in those
conventions, and as I am not able always to conform to them, for
years past I have followed the later Saints, and therefore have
satisfied myself with the <i>Dwadasha Mantra </i>of the Bhagavata or
the still simpler formula of Tulsidas and a few selections from the
<i>Gita </i>and other works, and a few <i>bhajans </i>in Prakrit.
These are my daily spiritual food—my <i>Gayatri</i>. They give me
all the peace and solace I need from day to day.</p>

There is no doubt that, like the growing poverty of India, the cattle
problem is growing more and more serious. But the cattle problem of
India is, for the vast majority of the population—the Hindus, the
problem of cow-protection, taking the expression in its broad sense.
There is, therefore, no doubt that we shall have to pay ‘a
staggering price’ for ever. If we have no ‘cow-veneration’, we
could make short work of all the surplus and dilapidated cattle, and
save the seventeen hundred and sixty-four millions of rupees which
the writer has dished out for us. Similarly, no doubt, we could free
this land from poverty by killing out all the surplus population, all
the diseased, all the weaklings, and a few thousands of us may then
live on this vast surface of the earth, with a few pistols or some
more quickly-working weapon of destruction for ridding ourselves of
those men and animals, ferocious or otherwise, whom we may regard as
a burden. But in India, like the poor and the diseased everywhere, we
shall have to have our brethren the cattle also, and we must,
therefore, solve the cattle problem, as the poverty problem, along
our own, or as some might say, superstitious lines. I have
endeavoured to show the way in my address to the Cow-Protection
Conference. Within the limitations prescribed by religious sentiment,
we must adopt the latest scientific methods. We must resort to
scientific castration, we must find out an economical method of
feeding our cattle, we must take the maximum of service consistently
with the welfare of the cattle, we must increase the milk supply from
the existing cows and buffaloes, and we must make the best economical
use of the hides of all dead cattle. If we succeed in doing these
things, we shall have gone a long way towards solving the cattle
problem.</p>

There will still have to be a price paid for religious sentiment, but
a religious sentiment is not worth the name if it is not worth paying
for. The money that is daily being paid in the name of cow-
protection blindly and in utter ignorance of scientific facts can be
well utilized for the purposes above mentioned. It will make no
direct return, but it will, under better conditions, prevent the
wicked waste that is going on, and certainly save thousands of cattle
from the butcher’s knife to which they fall victim, not because of
Mussalman or English cussedness, but because of Hindu stupidity.
Today, because of our ignorance and slothfulness, millions of human
beings and millions of cattle are dying of semi-starvation—a sad
reflection upon religious India.</p>

enforced early widowhood, human tragedy becomes complete. Any
sensible legislation in the direction of raising the Age of Consent
will certainly have  my approval. But I am painfully conscious of the
fact that even the  existing legislation has proved abortive for want
of public opinion to support it. The task before the reformer in
this, as in many other directions, is most difficult. Constant and
continuous agitation is necessary if any real impression is to be
made on the Hindu public. I wish every success to those who are

There is some truth in the correspondent’s reasoning. But he is
wholly wrong in imputing all evil to the Government. After all, is
there not a great deal of truth in the saying that a people  get  the
Government they deserve? If we had not been a people easily duped and
as easily subdued, we would not have succumbed to the blandishments
or the force of the East India Company and given up hand-spinning or
khaddar. If the Hindus and Mussalmans had been living like brothers,
the British satraps could not have divided us. And it is libellous to

if the Government had no fear of a revolt of orthodoxy, they would
have made short work of untouchability long ago. I do not know a

blame to the British Government for the Vaikom business. It is solely
due to the timidity of the indigenous Government. I am no lover of
the existing system of Government. But I shall fail to destroy it if,
in my rage, I lose the faculty for discrimination. ‘Give the devil

But I fully suspect that, when khaddar becomes powerful enough to
oust foreign cloth, the Government will probably endeavour to kill
it. I refuse to believe that it is or need be a rebel’s dress. What
is true is that there is a subtle propaganda against khaddar in
Government circles. I am told that the wearing of khaddar places the
wearer under observation. He cannot get the facilities he would
otherwise get in Government circles. But there is nothing to prevent
the general body of people from adopting khaddar. Surely swaraj will
not drop from the clouds. It will be the fruit of patience,
perseverance, ceaseless toil, courage and an intelligent appreciation
of the environment. Even the ‘divine agency’ of which the
correspondent writes will be available to prayerful toil, not
laziness of mind or body. Prayer without labour is like faith without
works—a Dead Sea apple. Whilst, therefore, we may not have complete
exclusion of foreign cloth, we might at least make a ‘decent show’
of khaddar before swaraj is won. What is, there, for instance, to
prevent Congressmen from wearing khaddar  on all occasions or from
spinning? Or are they to be expected to wear khaddar and spin after
swaraj is established? Are we angels merely waiting for the
establishment of national Government to flap our wings? We may not
have an ideal communal unity before swaraj. But what is there to
prevent a workable unity ? Is it not rather a fact that we distrust
one another too much really to desire swaraj?</p>

The correspondent’s mistake lies in his misconception of the
function of Government. He evidently thinks  that  an  ideal
Government is that which orders everything for us so that we need not
even think for ourselves. Whereas, in truth, a Government that is
ideal governs the least. It is no self-government that leaves nothing
for the people to do. That is pupilage—our present state. My
correspondent is evidently unable as yet to rise superior to that.
But, if we are to attain swaraj, a large number of us must outgrow
enforced nonage and feel our adolescence. We must govern ourselves at
least where there is no deadly opposition from armed authority. The
triple programme is the test of our capacity for self-government. If
we impute all our</p>

The correspondent reminds me of a statement made by me at Belgaum
that, probably, at the end of the year, if there is not much headway
made, I would find a way whereby we could make our final choice and
say ‘Death or Swaraj’. He has evidently in mind some strange
upheaval in which all distinction between violence and non- violence
will be abolished. Such confusion will most assuredly lead to
self-indulgence [which] is not self-rule. Self-indulgence is anarchy,
and though anarchy is every time better than slavery or suppression
of self, it is a state which I would not only have no hand in
consciously bringing into being, but which I am by nature unfitted to
bring about. Any method of ‘Death or Swaraj’ that I may suggest
will always avoid confusion and anarchy. My swaraj will be,
therefore, not a result of murder of others, but a voluntary act of
continuous self-sacrifice. My swaraj will not be a bloody usurpation
of rights but the acquisition of power. It will be a beautiful and
natural fruit of duty well and truly performed. It will, therefore,
provide amplest excitement of the Chaitanya type, not of the Nero
type. I have no formula at the present moment, but with my
correspondent I share the belief that it will be a divine guidance. I
am awaiting the sign. It can come, often does come, when the horizon
is the blackest. But I know that it will be precededby the rise of a
class of young men and women who will find full excitement in work,
work and nothing but work for the nation.</p>

A COMMON SCRIPT</i></h1>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 95%">
If we are to make good our claim as one nation, we must have several
things in common. We have a common culture running  through a variety
of creeds and sub-creeds. We have common disabilities. I am
endeavouring to show that a common material for our dress is not only
desirable but necessary. We need also a common language not in
supersession of the vernaculars, but in addition to them. It is
generally agreed that that medium should be Hindustani—a resultant
of Hindi and Urdu, neither highly Sanskritized, nor Persianized or
Arabianized. The greatest obstacle in the way are the numerous
script, we have for the vernaculars. If it is possible to adopt  a
common script we should remove a great hindrance in the way of
realizing the dream which, at present, is of having a  common
language. A variety of scripts  iss an obstacle in more ways than
one.  It constitutes an effectual barrier against the acquisition of
knowledge. The Aryan languages have so much in common that, if a
great deal of</p>

time had not to be wasted in mastering the different scripts, we
should all know several languages without much difficulty; for
instance, most people who have a little knowledge of Sanskrit would
have no difficulty in understanding the matchless creation of
Rabindranath Tagore, if it was all printed in Devanagari script. But
the Bengali script  is a notice to the non-Bengalis—“hands off”.
Conversely, if the Bengalis knew the Devanagari script, they would at
once be able to enjoy the marvellous beauty and spirituality of
Tulsidas and a host of other Hindustani writers. When I returned to
India in 1915,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I  had  a communication from a society whose
headquarters were, I believe, in Calcutta, and whose object was to
advocate a common script for all India. I do not know the activities
of that society, but its object isworthy, and a great deal of
substantial work can be done by a few earnest workers in this
direction. There are obvious limitations. A common script for all
India is a distant ideal. A common script for all those who speak the
Indo-Sanskrit languages, including the Southern stock, is a practical
ideal, if we can but shed our provincialisms. There is little virtue,
for instance, in a Gujarati clinging to the Gujarati script. A
provincial patriotism is good where it feeds the larger stream of
all- India patriotism, as the latter is good to the extent that it
serves the still larger end of the universe. But a provincial
patriotism that says “India is nothing, Gujarat is all”, is
wickedness. I have selected Gujarat because it is the half-way house,
and because I am myself a Gujarati. In Gujarat, somewhat fortunately,
those who settled the principles of primary education decided to make
Devanagari script compulsory. Every Gujarati boy or girl who has
passsed through a school, therefore, knows both the Gujarati and the
Devanagari scipts. If the committee had decided upon purely
Devanagari script, it would have been better still. No doubt, the
research scholars would still have learnt the Gujarati script for
deciphering old manuscripts, but the Gujarati boy's energy would have
been spared for more useful labour, if he  had to learn only one
instead of two scipts. The committee that settled the education
scheme for Maharashtra, was more enlightened, and it simply required
the Devanagari script. The result is that a Mahratta reads, so far as
mere reading is concerned, Tulsidas with as much facility as he reads
Tukaram, and Gujaratis and Hindustanis read Tukaram with equal
facility. The committee in Bengal, on the other hand, ruled
otherwise, with the result we all know and many of</p>

us deplore. The treasures of the richest Indian vernacular have been
rendered most difficult of access as if by design. That Devanagari
should be the common script, I suppose, does not need any
demonstration—the deciding factor being that it is the script known
to the largest part of India.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
These reflections arise, because, I was called upon to solve, during
my visit to Cuttack, a practical question. There is  a  tribe wedged
between the Hindi speaking people in Bihar and Uriya speaking people
of Orissa. What was to be done for the education of its children ?
Were they to be taught through Uriya or through Hindi? Or were they
to be taught through their own dialect and, if they were, was the
script to be Devanagari or a new invention? The first thought of the
Utkal friends was to absorb the tribe amongst the Uriyas. The Biharis
would think of absorbing them in Bihar, and if the elders of the
tribe were consulted, they would most probably and naturally say that
their dialect was just as good as the Uriya or the Bihari, and that
it should be reduced to writing. And for them it would be a toss
whether the script to be adopted should be Devanagari or Uriya, if
not even a newly invented script, as has happened in modern times in
at least two instances I know. Endeavouring to think in terms of all
India, I suggested to my friends that, whilst it was proper for them
to strengthen the Uriya language among the Uriya speaking people, the
children of this tribe should be taught Hindi and, naturally, the
script should be Devanagari. A spirit that is so exclusive and narrow
as to want every form of speech to be perpetuated and developed is
anti- national and anti-universal. All undeveloped and unwritten
dialects should, in my humble opinion, be sacrificed and merged in
the great Hindustani stream. It would be a sacrifice only to be
nobler, not a suicide. If we are to have a common language for
cultured India, we must arrest the growth of any process of
disintegration or multi- plication of languages and scripts. We must
promote a common lan- guage. The beginning must naturally be made
with the script, and until the Hindu-Muslim question is solved,
confined perhaps to Hindu India. If I could have my way, I would make
the learning of Devanagari script and Urdu script, in addition to the
established provincial script compulsory in all the provinces and I
would print in Devanagari chief books in the different vernaculars
with a literal translation in Hindustani. Unfortunately, not many
Congressmen have taken the trouble of learning the Devanagari script
and fewer still the Urdu script.</p>

am not blind to the necessity of sanitation. I became a sanitary
reformer long before I discovered the charkha. I was myself carrying
on at the farm in Phoenix, Natal, experiments in burying night-soil
and converting it into rich manure. We had there no scavenger; we
were our own scavengers, and as, Mr. Andrews himself knows, one could
walk about the settlement in Phoenix bare-footed without the danger
of treading upon any dirt. The same treatment of night-soil is being
continued at the Satyagraha Ashram on the banks of the Sabarmati. But
I do not carry on any propaganda about it for the simple reason that
it  cannot solve the problem of the daily- growing poverty
immediately and directly. Moreover, in dealing with this question of
insanitation, one has to fight against old prejudices and old habits.
It is a matter of sustained education and one that cannot be dealt
with without State aid. I regret to have to confess that ingrained
bad habits handed down from generation to generation do not yield to
persuasion. Legislation seems to me to be the only  effective remedy.</p>

But the same objection does not apply to the charkha. On the
contrary, it is to be the precursor of every reform, and if I can
only concentrate the attention of the nation upon the charkha, it
will automatically solve all the other problems and pave the way for
legislation where legislation is required. The charkha is calculated
to make an immediate return, be it ever so small, to the individual.
It presents the least difficulty in its working. There is  no  rooted
prejudice against it. For the simple folk at least it requires no
elaborate reasoning. It needs the smallest capital. It is the only
constructive effort that is possible on a national scale. It is
fraught with tremendous political consequences if it becomes
successful, and seeing that it cannot succeed without co-operation it
makes for a mighty co- operative effort. Hence the claim that
concentration on charkha alone leads to swaraj, and if this is too
strong a proposition, let it be put in another way— ‘Without the
charkha and all it implies there is no swaraj, and therefore a wise
economist will concentrate his attention upon the charkha alone,
knowing that the rest will follow.’</p>

Let me diagnose the disease a little deeper. It is not the drain that
matters so much as poverty, and it is not even poverty that matters
so much as idleness which was at first enforced, and has now become a
habit that matters. The drain may be stopped and poverty is merely a
symptom, but idleness is the great cause, the root of all evil, and
if that root can be destroyed, most of the evils, can be remedied
without further effort. A nation that is starving has little hope or
initiative left in it. It becomes indifferent to filth and disease.
It says of all reforms ‘to what good?’ That winter of despair can
only be turned into the ‘sunshine of hope’ for the millions only
through  the  life-giving wheel, the charkha.</p>

Some friends have been to me telling me that the date 22nd September
for the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee is an
inconvenient one for the Bengalis in view of the forthcoming Puja
holidays. The date has been fixed in consultation with Pandit Motilal
Nehru who has chosen it after consultation with the members of the
Assembly.  The  original  date  fixed  has  been  anticipated  for

journey. Had the 1st of October been retained, it would not have been
possible to fix the venue at Patna. Even as it is, a telegram has
been received from Sind protesting against the venue being fixed at
Patna. I appreciate the difficulty of the Sindhi friends. But Patna
has been chosen after much consultation and for the convenience of
the majority of the members. The real Puja holiday commences on the
24th and I have promised the Bengal friends that, even though there
may have to be a late night sitting, I shall finish the deliberations
of the All-India Congress Committee on the 22nd so as to free the
members to leave for Calcutta the night of 22nd. If any  routine
matters requiring the attention of the All-India Congress Committee
remain over, and on which Bengali friends might not have any fixed
views, subject to their consent, the proceedings will be prolonged
beyond the 22nd. But the main purpose for which the meeting is being
convened will be finished on the 22nd. I hope to be in Patna on the
20th. 21st is my day of silence, and I shall be free to discuss with
friends who might arrive on the 20th any question that they may wish
to discuss in regard to the proposed change in the constitution.
Needless to say that no change in constitution will be adopted unless
there is an absolute unanimity. I hope all the members of the
A.I.C.C. will attend the forthcoming meeting.</p>

little praise upon the speaker of the evening. I wish I could do

But in India, at the present moment, the young generation is
undoubtedly face to face with this very problem. Is it possible to
love one’s country and not to hate those who rule over one’s
country, whose domination we do not want, whose domination we dislike
from the bottom of our hearts? The answer has been in the hearts of
many young men that it is impossible to love one’s country and not
to hate those who rule over one's country. Some of them expressed
their opinion in board daylight, a few of them translate that opinion
into action. Many, however, harbour this opinion in secret and feed
upon that opinion.</p>

I have been a student of this question, not since my return to India
in 1915, but ever since I entered into public life and public
service. That was in 1894. But I have come deliberately to the
conclusion that love of one’s country, namely nationalism, is
perfectly consistent with the love of those whose rule, whose
domination whose methods we do not like. I was face to face with that
problem in my dealings with the South African Government or, more
accurately speaking, the then Natal Government; later on with the
Transvaal Government and later still with the Union Government. Most
of you are aware of the disabilities—the glaring disabilities—under
which our countrymen labour in that sub-continent—South Africa. It
is enough; those disabilities are really enough to make one hate
one’s fellow beings, if one did not preserve one’s sanity. You

skin. There shall be no equality between the white and the coloured
races—so runs the constitution of the Union Government. It was at
one time an article of the Transvaal Government constitution, but the
constitution has today been adopted by the Union Government. When you
come to India you find, though not the same thing, much the same
thing and very often one finds it most difficult to reconcile the two
things, love of one’s country and love also of one whom you may
consider to be the tiger. It is beside the point whether you are just
and correct in your estimate or whether you are incorrect, but the
impression left upon your mind is that you are labouring under the
grossest form of tyranny, grossest form of injustice. How shall you
then love the tiger?</p>

Let me put it in another way—not necessarily that you should love
the tiger, but love is an active force and the subject  of  this
evening is—Is it necessary to hate the tiger? Is hatred essential
for nationalism? You may not love, but must you also hate? The
answer, as I have said before, in the minds of many people is
undoubtedly that you must hate. Some, I know, consider it their duty
to hate the tiger and they cite instances from modern constitutions,
they cite the late disastrous War in Europe, they cite wars of which
they have learnt in history; they cite also the law, and they say
society hangs on the gallows those who are guilty of murder. Is not
that a sign of hatred? There certainly is no love. Would not one love
one’s father, would not one love one’s dearest ones, even if they
might err? [Would one wish them] to be hanged on the gallows? One
would pray for their reformation but not for their punishment, and
yet, it is said, perhaps with a great deal of justification, that
society will break into pieces if under the law of sanction
punishment was withdrawn, abolished or suspended. With those
illustrations before them, the young men rush to the conclusion that
those who consider that hatred is not essential for nationalism are
in the wrong. I do not blame them. They have to be pitied; they
command my sympathy, but I have not a shadow of doubt in my mind that
they are labouring under the grossest delusion; and so long as they
retain that attitude, so long as a large body of men and women retain
that attitude the progress of this country, the progress of the world
is retarded. It does not matter to me that all those illustrations
that I have placed before you can be cited in order to justify their
conduct.</p>

humanity. Let it be the privilege of India to turn a new leaf and set
a lesson to the world. (Cries of ‘hear, hear’.) Is it necessary
that three hundred millions of people should hate one hundred
thousand Englishmen? That is the concrete term to which I can reduce
this evening’s subject. In my humble opinion it is derogatory to 
the  dignity of mankind, it is derogatory to the dignity of India to 
entertain for one single moment hatred towards Englishmen. That does
not mean that you are to be blind to the excesses that English rulers
have been found to commit in India. I have drawn this particular
distinction between the evil and the evil-doer. Hate the evil but not
the evil-doer. We ourselves, every one of us, are full of evil. And
we want the world to be patient with us, to be forgiving, to be
gentle with us. I would like the same thing to be meted out to the
Englishmen. Heaven knows no one in India perhaps can claim better
than myself to have spoken as fiercely and as fearlessly of the many
misdeeds of English rulers and the corrupt nature of the system under
which we are governed. My freedom from hatred—I would even go so
far as to claim for myself individually—my love of those who
consider themselves to be my enemies, does not make me blind to their
faults. That is no love which is extended simply because of the
possession of some virtues fancied or real in the beloved. If I am
true to myself, if I am true to mankind, if I am true to humanity, I
must understand all the faults that human flesh is heir to. I must
understand the weaknesses of my opponents, the vices of my opponents
and, yet, in spite of these vices, not hate but even love them. It is
by itself a force. Brute force has been handed down to us from
generation to generation. We have used it and we have found what it
has done for Europe and what it has done for the world. The glamour
of European civilization does not dazzle us. Scratch beneath the
surface and you will find there very little to choose.</p>

my business is to love them and by patient and gentle handling to
convert them. Non-co-operation or satyagraha, therefore, is not a
hymn of hate. I know that many who call themselves satyagrahis or
non-co-operators do not deserve to bear that name. They have done a
violence to their own creed. They were not real representatives of
this principle. Real non-co-operation is non-co-operation with evil
and not with the evil-doer. Sometimes it is difficult, I know, to
distinguish between evil and evil-doer. But how are you to
non-co-operate with the evil and not with the evil-doer? I do not
want to go into the whole of the intricate doctrine. I can simply
comment on what is going on during these 5 or 6 years. If we
understand the secret of this doctrine and the beautiful consistency
between hating evil and not hating evil- doers, I have said that all
that we need today is to extend the law that we apply in our domestic
relations to the political field, and, therefore, to the relations
between the rulers and the ruled and you will find the true solution.

Your non-co-operation is intended not to encourage evil. That is the
meaning. One of the greatest writers has said that if the world
ceases to encourage evil, evil will die of inanition. If we simply
find out for ourselves to what extent we are responsible for the evil
that exists in society today, we will soon see that evil will soon be
gone from society. But we tolerate it under a false sense of love. I
am not talking of the blind love that dotes on an erring son and pats
him on the back while he errs, nor am I speaking of the son who,
under a false sense of loyalty to his father, tolerates evil in his
father. I am not talking of that. I am talking of the love that
discriminates, that is intelligent, that is not blind to a single
fault .That is the love of reform, and the moment we have seized the
secret, that very moment the evil goes out of sight.</p>

I talk of the relations between the two races. Think of the many
evils from which we are suffering today in Hindu society. Let alone
Mussalmans, let alone Christians, Parsis and others. The majority of
us are Hindus. How should we deal with the evil that is rampant in
Hinduism? Shall we hate those who consider untouchability part and
parcel of Hindu religion and quote scriptures in favour of
untouchability or shall we remove untouchability by our persistent
conduct? The secret, then, is suffering, but not to subject the evil-
doers to suffering, but to take the suffering upon our own shoulders.</p>

If we reform Hinduism of the many abuses that have crept into it, we
shall only do so by  taking  the  instance  of  Vaikom. It comes to
me naturally because it is through praise that you see the finished
example. I know every one of the brave young men. I think I know
every one of them who are working in Vaikom under terrible
difficulites. They have undergone suffering which I cannot possibly
describe here in the few moments, but I dare give this testimony to
you that these young men have not erred by a hair’s breadth. I mean
the young men of Vaikom. I don’t say individuals have not erred,
but they have kept their record absolutely clean. The result is that
they have not yet got rid of the whole of abuses, but I have not a
shadow of doubt in my mind that in Travancore today untouchability
has lost its foothold, it is fast dying simply because of the
determination of a handful of youth who plunged themselves down into
the midst of Vaikom and invited suffering on their own shoulders.
That is really the secret. In my humble opinion hatred is not
essential for nationalism. Race hatred will kill the real national
spirit. Let us understand what nationalism is. We want freedom for
our country. We do not want sufferings for other countries: we do not
want the exploitation of other countries; we do not want the
degradation of other countries. For my part I don’t want the
freedom of India if it means the disappearance of Englishmen, if it
means the extinction of Englishmen. I want the freedom of my country
so that other countries may learn something from this free country of
mine. I want freedom of my country so that the resources of my
country might be utilized for the benefit of mankind just as the cult
of patriotism teaches us today that the individual has to die for the
family, the family has to die for the village, the village for the
district, the district for the  Province and the Provinces for the
whole nation, and when we indulge in provincialism I as a Gujarati
say, Gujarat first, Bengal and the rest of Provinces next. There is
no nationalism in it. On the contrary if I live in Gujarat and
prepare Gujarat, I should prepare Gujarat so that the vast resources
of Gujarat might be placed at  the  disposal  of Bengal, nay, of the
whole of India, that Gujarat may die for the whole of India. My love,
therefore, of nationalism, or my idea of nationalism is that my
country may become free—free that if need be the whole of the
country may die— so that the human race may live. There is no</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
room here for race hatred. Let that  be our nationalism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">A
question from Mr. Chapman, the Librarian of the Imperial Library, at
the conclusion of the speech, drew a telling reply from Gandhiji.
‘Was not the insistence on political freedom and political equality
on the part of Indians conducive to race hatred, when Indians
themselves were not capable of ruling themselves’ was in effect Mr.
Chapman’s question.</font></font></p>

tolerate your rule so long as we are not capable of managing our
affairs, you are mistaken. We can develop that capacity only by
resistance to the system. And may I say that the questioner
unconsciously betrayed his own race prejudice when he referred to
Indians as incapable of ruling themselves. Underlying that prejudice
is the idea of superiority and the conceit that the Englishmen are
born to manage the affairs of the world. That is an idea to fight
which my whole life has been dedicated. Unless the Englishmen are
dislodged from that position there is no peace in india, nor any
peace for the weaker races of the earth. It is the absolute right of
India to misgovern herself. My heart rebels against any foreigner
imposing on  my  country the peace which is here called ‘Pax
Britannica’.</p>

My swadeshi is khaddar, because I have taken my stand on one thing,
and restricted my swadeshism. Manufactured goods we must not
use—goods from outside which we can usefully manufacture in our own
country. That is not antagonistic to anything, but it is the law of
charity beginning at home it is the law of charity which teachs us
that, if we do not serve our family, our neighbour, we will not be
able to serve our distant neighbour. Remember one yard of calico puts
into the pockets of the labourers one pie. One yard of khaddar,
khaddar bought from the villagers, puts into the hands of the
famishing villagers at least four annas. Make your choice—one pie
or four annas and decide for yourselves.</p>

next referred to the deplorable condition of the Indian Christians
for their mixing Christianity with European modes and methods. He
said that, for the first time, he detected this perverse mentality of
the Indian Christians in South Africa and from that time he had been
all along striving hard to combat this evil idea. He had very often
tried to prove that there was a clear distinction between the modes
and manners of Europeans and Indian Christians. On the previous
evening, he showed that race hatred was not nationalization</font><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

shown that Christianity did not mean denationalization. He was quite
sure that for them Christianity did not mean Europeanization. It had
no geographical limit. Jesus lived every inch of him in Asia and
certainly Christianity had no relation whatsoever with
Europeanization.</font></font></p>

peasants. In other countries, however, people do not live by farming

However, as only a few persons can cultivate the land all the year
round, crores of people are without any occupation for four to six
months. Hence we have become idle. This has not always been our
plight. Crores of people were kept employed when we made cloth
ourselves. All these crores suffer from idleness today. Their eyes
have lost lustre. They are without hope; their faces are devoid  of
enthusiasm. We are in such a sad plight where idleness has become
second nature to us. This idleness of the peasants is shared by the
middle class too. There can be no swaraj for an idle nation. Idleness
leads to destruction. While moving amidst hundreds of thousands of
people, I find that they do not get weary of chatting or just sitting
doing nothing. If I don’t look out, many people would sit around me
and believe that they were doing something meritorious.</p>

believe that while the drain of money from this country is the cause

what else can an idle person become but a slave? Idlers have never

How to get rid of this idleness? By taking up some sort of activity.
Which is the activity that can be taken up by crores of human beings?
In my opinion the spinning-wheel is the only activity of this kind.
Anyone who can find a better activity for the people is free not to
work on the spinning-wheel. I have been claiming from the very
beginning that the spinning-wheel is the best possible means  of 
making an idle person active; however, if anyone points out a more
fruitful means which could be generally adopted, I will readily bow
to him. I have come across many persons who are hard working
themselves . But does this make the whole country industrious? There
are ten or twenty millionaires in India, there are twenty-five or
fifty rulers; does that, however make everyone a millionaire or a
ruler? We can be called a single nation when those who are well-to-do
partake of the misery of the country. Even a person like Shri Krishna
had to work for the mass of people even though it was unnecessary so
far as he himself was concerned. Moreover, it is not sufficient to be
engaged</p>

in work that is directed to one’s self-interest. Those who can be
called public leaders or public servants will pursue for the good of
others an activity which crores of persons pursue in mere self
interest. If they do not do this, even those who work of the sake of
self-interest will give it up under a false glamour or illusion. In
this case, we have to fashion workers out of idlers. We have also to
teach them an activity which will bring about the good of the
individual and society. The spinning- wheel alone can offer such an
activity. It is for this very reason that I call the spinning-wheel a
 <i>Kamadhenu</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>.

Mr. Andrews has posed two questions. We incur a loss of crores of
rupees every year as cattle are not properly looked after. Moreover,
as people do not put their excreta to good use, manure worth crores
of rupees is wasted, and this also leads to the spread of diseases
among people. If I can stress the importance of the activity of
spinning, why do I not attempt readily to save crores of rupees by
stressing the importance of this problem of cattle and this problem
of filth? I have taken up the responsibility of cow-protection by way
of protecting cattle. The problem of filth is a very difficult one
which also owes its existence partly to our idleness. If people
realize the importance of working hard the problem of cattle and that
 of  filth  would immediately be solved. If people do not take up the
 activity  of spinning which is both easy and immediately rewarding
how will they understand the problem posed by cattle and filth, which
can be solved after very great efforts? Hence, from whichever angle
you look you will see the very same thing. Idleness is the great
disease of India and the spinning-wheel is the sole remedy for it.</p>

It is extremely difficult to solve the problem of mismanagement where
it exists in the Indian States. But it is not impossible. That,
however, depends on increasing the strength of the peasantry and
educating the rulers. The srength of the former cannot be increased
by any outward struggle but through their own training. Hence,
constructive work is the basis for solving political problems.
Opinions may differ on whether this means the spinning-wheel or some
other activity. But the time is drawing near when there will be a
general agreement that the true solution of political problems lies
in the education of the people. This education does not imply mere
literacy but an awakening of the people from their slumber. The
people should become aware of their own condition. Such awareness is
possible only through public work and not through talks. This does
not also mean that every outward agitation is useless. As I have said
in <i>Young India</i>, outward agitations too have their place.

Wherever I go I happen to meet Gujaratis living outside their

afraid of coming to me and handing in their contribution, for fear of
losing the contracts that they had been getting from Englishmen. At

Yes, a guilty conscience makes a man miserable. Those who earn a
living dishonestly are afraid of everyone. Why then were these
gentlemen afraid? Those who resort to fraudulent practices in
contracts see fear where there is none. However, I hope that these
timid gentlemen had no such cause for fear. I do not wish to see any
Indian, man or woman, being frightened. I had imagined  that
Gujaratis who live outside their province must have rid themselves of
ordinary fears. While on tour, I have had direct  experiecne  of
Gujaratis being fearless when others were afraid. The incident in

shed their fear. [From Gujarati]</p>

Our rules regarding cleanliness are fine: one should always take a
bath. We do not, however, know the implications of all these acts;
hence they have become merely a ritual. Alternatively, we give in to
superstitions and believe that the touch of water—of whatever
quality and in however small a quantity—purifies us and makes us
fit for heaven. Science, however, tells us that a bath is beneficial
only when it  is taken with clean water and when the body is rubbed
and cleaned. There is no sense in sprinkling a few drops of water or
just in pouring water on oneself and putting on dirty clothes; this
may even be harmful. Our lavatories are like hell on earth. To visit
these is like committing a sin. We could improve these with a little
effort, thought and discretion. There is no question of any expense
involved in it. Knowledge is all that is required. Even the poorest
of the poor can, if he wishes to follow the rules of cleanliness. It
is true that he cannot afford to have an aversion for looking at and

fills up cart-loads of filth in a very dirty way.</p>

The lanes of Ahmedabad are dirty not because of poverty but because
of great ignorance and idleness. In Madras in the well-to-do
localities I found wealthy persons of fifty using the lanes as
latrines in the morning. I feel disgusted even when I think of that
sight. In Hardwar, the pilgrims fill the banks of the holy Ganges
with foul smell, morning and evening. It becomes impossible to sit or
walk there. At some places these people clean themselves directly in
the river and do not even carry water in vessel to clean themselves 
with. In the river near Trichinopoly one can see excreta with the 
naked eye! And , the same water is used for bathing and drinking! In
Bengal hundreds of puddle-like tiny lakes are used for the purpose of
bathing, washing and drinking—by cattle and human beings.</p>

The complaint made by Mr. Andrews’s friend, however, relates to
something else. He says, “the farmers make dirty the soil by
defecating and urinating at any place. When it rains there, the water
is</p>

polluted by all this filth and, since lakhs of people walk bare-foot,
they fall a prey to hookworm, dysentery, etc. Many people suffer and
many die an untimely death. Fine manure can be made out of this
filth. The people of China save crores of rupees by doing so. Why
should not Indians do so and, at the same time, keep healthy? At one
time the conditions in South America were the same  as  those 
obtaining in India. They have been changed in twenty years with great
effort and the people are free from many diseases”.</p>

I hope that every member of the A.I.C.C, unless he is prevented by
unforeseen circumstances, will make it a point to attend the
forthcoming meeting of the Committee and take part in its
deliberations and register his vote. The change sought to be made in
the constitution can only be justified, if there is a unanimous and
insistent demand for it. Unanimity and insistence can only be proved
by every member attending even at considerable inconvenience and
sacrifice if necessary. It will not do for members to assume anything
as a foregone conclusion, and let those who attend do what they like.
Absence from the meeting will be presumed to be a sign of want of
sense of responsibiltiy unless the absence is otherwise duly
accounted for. Members should realize that I have not worried them
throughout the year, and but for the emergency I would  certainly 
not  have worried them now. In my opinion, a meeting of the All-India
Congress Committee and the expense attendant upon it can only be
warranted if a new policy has to be initiated or important
resolutions of an educative character are required to be passed. The
intention at first was to hold the meeting on the 1st of October in
Bombay. But it was suggested that an earlier meeting will be more
convenient for the members of the Committee, and that it could be
more conveniently held at Patna. There is hardly a place which is
equally suitable for all. When Bombay was thought of, the Bengalis
were perturbed. Patna having been appointed, there is a protest from
far-off Sind. I wish it was possible for me to please all the members
and all the provinces in justifying the choice of Patna. I can only
say that it was selected because many considered that it was the most
suitable place, and more especially, because Pandit Motilalji desired
it after consultation with his colleagues in the Assembly. And I had
no hesitation in fixing Patna when I knew that Panditji’s health
would be better conserved by selecting Patna as the venue. He is by
no means yet strong or completely restored. Asthmatic spasms are only
under check and are kept so by the greatest vigilance and care. I,
therefore, hope that no member will absent himself because Patna is
too far away for him.</p>

Patna whether they are members of the A.I.C.C. or not. I would like
them to advise Babu Rajendra Prasad of their intention to attend and

The idea running through my mind is to lighten the burden of the
forthcoming Congress, to adjust defferences that there may be amongst
Congressmen, and to explore avenues, if any, of common action by all
parties so that the Congress may be free to discuss and initiate new
policies and new programmes if any. It may be asked why I am not
inviting leaders of other parties also to meet at Patna. I had given
most anxious consideration to the matter, and I have come to the
conclusion that such an invitation at this stage will bear no fruit.
It will be time enough to take the next step when all the Congressmen
know their own minds and become of one mind. The differences between
the Congressmen and others are well known and well defined. It will
be for the Congressmen first to consider how far it is possible for
them to go, and then to hold consultation with the leaders of the
other parties. For the time being, I must content myself with giving
the assurance to all concerned that I yield to no one in my disire to
see all the parties united on a common platform. But I know that when
the differences are fundamental, it is difficult, in spite of all the
desire in the world, to construct a common platform. What is true of
Chemistry is true of human beings. Incompatibles meet but to explode.
What every Congressman aims at, and must aim at, is a real union or
combination which would mean strength, not a patched-up makeshift
which can only weaken the nation and, therefore, retard the national
cause.</p>

any use in occasional use of khaddar. On the principle that something
is better than nothing even an occasional use of khaddar is to be
encouraged. We want to sell home-made, home-woven, and home- spun
cloth. Any demand for such cloth is, therefore, welcome and those who
make occasional use are likely to make even habitual use of khaddar.
I would, therefore, encourage its use of every occasion. Nor can I
endorse the remark that those who wear khaddar on particular
occasions are necessarily hypocrites. If a man pretends to be what he
is not, he is a hypocrite, not one who makes no such pretences. One
who drinks secretly and makes his neighbour believe that he is a
teetotaller is a hypocrite to be shunned. A man who makes no secret
of his habit of drinking, but omits drinking in society, or out of 
regard for his friends, is not only not a hypocrite, but a sensible
and considerate man, and there is every hope of his being weaned from
his habit. If, therefore, the people of Purulia, who are reported to
be buying khaddar in view of my forthcoming visit, are doing so in
order to induce the belief in me that they have never worn any other
cloth, they are undoubtedly hypocrites. But I do not believe that
they are buying khaddar with any such unholy design. It is no secret
to me that a vast number of people have not yet given up the habit of
using mill-made cloth, foreign or indigenous. But they do not mind
using khaddar occasionally, and, since it has now become the 
Congress  dress, people who attend Congress functions even
occasionally consider it proper to wear khaddar. Whilst, therefore, I
should like all</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
those in Bihar who are buying khaddar to enable them to appear at
Congress functions during my tour, to wear it habitually, I am unable
to condemn its use for the occasion of my tour. It is some gain, be
it ever so small, that the surplus khaddar stock in Bihar will be
used up and so much money freed for manufacture of more khaddar.</p>

The second point raised by the correspondent is serious. The only way
to avoid fraudulent imitations is for purchasers to ensure the purity
of their purchases. Congress organizations, or khaddar organizations
can do a great deal to prevent, or, at any rate, to check the evil.
The correspondent states khaddar stores should be run by the Congress
in all principal centres. Some such thing has been attempted, but it
is a matter of finance and organization. The All-India Spinners’
Association is being conceived for the purpose of dealing with such
evils. Meanwhile I would urge writers like my correspondent not to
give up khaddar for want of facility. It is because the successful
organizing of khaddar and the spinning-wheel means the evoking of all
that is best in us that I often say that the adoption of the
spinning- wheel will lead to swaraj.</p>

The correspondent also deals with the evil of half-khaddar being
manufactured and sold by Congress organizations. The evil is serious
enough. A Congress organization, which is pledged to sell khaddar,
can have nothing to do with half-khaddar. So long as Congressmen do
not see the simple truth that manufacture of half-khaddar prevents
the evolution of hand-spun yarn, spinning will be done indifferently.
To subject hand-spun yarn to the test of the loom by using it for the
warp is the surest and the quickest way of improving the quality of
hand-spun yarn. It is a superstition to believe that by and by one
would be able to displace mill yarn  from warp. The difficulty will
have to be faced one day. It has already been faced by several
Congress organizations. There is no difficulty about getting hand-
spun yarn woven, if not in the district of its production, in some
other district. I wish, therefore, that Congress organizations should
cease to weave or deal in half-khaddar.</p>

my attention. Only, the more I study the subject, the more I realize
the difficulty of the task. With the protection of the cow, in the
sense in which I have used it, is bound up not merely the welfare of
the cattle of all India and the good name of Hinduism, but, also to a
very large extent, the economic welfare of the country. The
conviction is also becoming more and more deep-rooted in me that the
solution of the problem lies in the acceptance by Hindus in
particular, and  the  Indians in general, of the methods adopted by
the Association. In order to enable me to study, or to have studied,
all the literature on cow-protection, I invite all local Associations
and those interested in the cattle problem, including the Agriculture
Department of the Government of India as also the provincial
Governments, to favour me with such literature and statistics as they
may possess on the cattle problem, the conducting of dairies,
tanneries, etc. The meeting of the Committee of the Association takes

There is at Serampore a weaving institute run by the  Government of
Bengal, through its Department of Industries, where hand-spinning is
being systematically taught. I was curious to know its progress and
the methods of instruction. I, therefore, applied for permission to
visit the institute which was readily granted. Mr. Hoogwerf showed me
round. There was hand-weaving, dyeing, and spinning not restricted to
cotton only, but extended to jute, silk, etc.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I propose, however, to confine my attention to cotton-spinning only.
I appreciated the anxiety of the staff about it, but I discovered at
once that there was not that technical ability and guidance which one
would expect in a teaching institution. I had gone there to find a
spinning expert with faith in hand-spinning. I had expected to find
also up-to-date spinning-wheels. I say this not by way of idle
criticism, but in the hope of definite improvement taking place in
the near future. Some of the spinning-wheels I saw there were
indifferently made and open to the same objections which I have
raised in these columns to many specimens I saw during my tour. Some
of them</p>

even created a jarring sound. The slivers were also not of the best.
Under the circumstances I should not at all wonder if in a short time
one finds a report to the effect that the experiment in hand-spinning
was a failure. Any experiment, before it can be pronounced a failure,
must be given the fairest chance. It must, therefore, be conducted by
one who has faith in it, and the requisite ability. There is, I
understand, a desire to introduce instruction in power-loom weaving
also at the Institute. As it is, the Institute is living on
starvation wages. It  is intended to promote cottage industries. In
my  opinion, the introduction of the power-loom will be a waste of
public money, and I say this not because of my disbelief in
power-looms, but because it dos not promote the object for which the
Institute has been founded. Every rupee voted for its management must
be devoted to the development of cottage industries, and, therefore,
all the activities of the Institute should be devoted to the
exploration of possibilities of hand-spinning, and the antecedent
processes and instruction therein.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
One thing I noticed in the Institute which can be copied by all
national institutions where hand-spinning is taught and developed.
Mr. Hoogwerf took me to his home which contains testing instruments
for testing the strength and the count of yarn, its evenness, the
staple of cotton and the durability of cloth when it is woven. If
some of these simple instruments are kept in national institutions
and judiciously used, they will help spinners to make rapid progress
and to check their spinning.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I must not omit an institution which is run chiefly from the aid of
the Government Institute and is situated near by. It is really a home
for girls to which a missionary lady has devoted herself. There, too,
hand-spinning is one of the things taught. But my criticism applies
equally to this home. The superintendent, in spite of all her will to
make it a success, cannot do so, until she herself learns the art, so
as to enable her to know a good wheel from a bad [one] and to know
when spinning is done properly.</p>

friend lies outside my orbit. I, therefore, attempt an answer merely
in courteous recognition of friendship between the questioner and
myself. I confess that no value attaches to my answer, save what we
attach to every considered argument. I know neither the diagnosis of
the European disease nor the remedy in the same sense that I claim to
know both in the case of India.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
I, however, feel that fundamentally the disease is the same in Europe
as it is in India, in spite of the fact that in the former country
the people enjoy political self-government, No mere transference of
political power in India will satisfy my ambition, even though I hold
such transference to be a vital necessity of Indian national life.
The peoples of Europe have no doubt political power but no swaraj.
Asian and African races are exploited for their partial benefit, and
they, on their part, are being exploited by the ruling class or caste
under the sacred name of democracy. At the root, therefore, the
disease appears to be the same as in India. The same remedy is,
therefore, likely to be applicable. Shorn of all the camouflage, the
exploitation of the masses of Europe is sustained by violence.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Violence on the part of the masses will never remove the disease.
Anyway, up to now experience shows that success of violence has</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
been short-lived. It has led to greater violence. What has been tried
hitherto has been a variety of violence and artificial checks
dependent mainly upon the will of the violent. At the crucial moment
these checks have naturally broken down. It seems to me, therefore,
that sooner or later, the European masses will have to take to
non-violence if they are to find their deliverance. That there is no
hope of their taking to it in a body and at once does not baffle me.
A few thousand years are but a speck in the vast time circle. Someone
has to make a beginning with a faith that will not flinch. I doubt
not that the masses, even of Europe, will respond, but what is more
emergent in point of time is not so much a large experiment in
non-violence as a precise grasp of the meaning of deliverance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
From what will the masses be delivered? It will not do to have vague
generalization and to answer “from exploitation and degradation”.
Is not the answer this that they want to occupy the status that
capital does today? If so, it can be  attained  only  by violence.
But if they want to shun the evils of capital, in other words, if
they would revise the viewpoint of capital, they would strive to
attain a juster distribution of the products of labour. This
immediately takes us to contentment and simplicity, voluntarily
adopted. Under the new outlook multiplicity of material wants will
not be the aim of life, the aim will be rather their restriction
consistently with comfort. We shall cease to think of getting what we
can, but we shall decline to receive what all cannot get. It occurs
to me that it ought not to be difficult to make a successful appeal
to the masses of Europe in terms of economics, and a fairly
successful working of such an experiment must lead to immense and
unconscious spiritual results. I do not believe that the spiritual
law works on a field of its own. On the contrary, it expresses itself
only through the ordinary activities of life. It thus affects the
economic, the social, and the political fields. If the masses of
Europe can be persuaded to adopt the view  I  have suggested, it will
be found that violence will be wholly unnecessary to attain the aim
and they can easily come to their own by following out the obvious
corollaries of non-violence. It may even be that what seems to me to
be so natural and feasible for India, may take longer to permeate the
inert Indian masses than the active European masses. But  I must
reiterate my confession that all my argument is based on suppositions
and assumptions and must, therefore, be taken for what it is worth.</p>

Although it has been published in the Press, it can bear repetition
here. I have also received a copy of the <i>Gazette </i>containing
the full text of the Bill. It is a long Bill divided into three

closely printed. I do not print the Bill, as without the aid of
previous enactments with which it deals and which it modifies or
repeals, it is not capable of being undrstood by the reader. Suffice
it to observe here that the cablegram faithfully summarizes the
restrictions sought to be imposed by the Bill. It reduces the
position of the resident Indian population to such an extent that,
without the Union Government having to pay any compensation
whatsoever, there will be no Indian settlers in South Africa within a
few years’ time. If the provisions of the Bill are applied with
enough stringency, there will be powers given to the administration
to freeze out every Indian, no matter what the step may be, in the
land of his adoption and even of his birth, for the Bill makes no
distinction between Indians born in South Africa and domiciled. The
safeguards provided by the Bill are all illusory and can be rendered
perfectly nugatory. That the Bill has not yet become law is a matter
of little comfort. The Bill is an indication of the determination of
the Union Government to starve the Indians out of South Africa. Mr.
Malan has made no secret of it. It is a matter of time when every
Indian will have left South Africa. Let the reader remember, or know,
that the Chinese labourers who were imported for developing the gold
mines of Johannesburg, were summarily repatriated when the Government
had made up its mind. The Chinese had no voice. So it will be with
Indians unless the Government of India choose to do its duty. Mr.
Bhayat has made a pathetic appeal to us here. So far as public
opinion is concerned, it is unanimously for the Indian settlers.
Unfortunately for them, it is at present ineffective. Such as it is,
it will certainly be mobilized for the purpose of preventing the
impending spoliation of our countrymen in South Africa in total
disregard of the Agreement of 1914, which was designed to guarantee
the then existing rights of the Indian residents in South Africa.</p>

domiciled in Bengal. I shall miss my daily pilgrimage to Basanti

which we are responsible. Had it been possible to canvass every

even as it is, the sum of Rs. 7,74,165-10-5 <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 4pt">2

calculation made, and the result shows that the resident Marwaris
have contributed over Rs. 140,000, the resident Gujaratis have
contributed nearly Rs.60,000, and the balance is contributed by the
Bengalis in Bengal, and outside Bengal, including small sums from
other provinces. The burden now rests upon those who are in charge of
the funds to fulfil the objects for which it has been raised.</p>

Some friends have been telling me that the date 22nd September for
the meeting of the All-India Congress Committee is an inconvenient
one for the Bengalis in view of the forthcoming Puja holidays . The
date has been fixed in consultation with Pandit Motilal Nehru who has
chosen it after consultation with the members of the Assembly. The
original date fixed has been anticipated for the convenience of these
members so that they might not have a double journey. Had the 1st of
October been retained, it would not have been possible to fix the
venue at Patna. Even as it is, a telegram has been received from Sind
protesting against the venue being fixed at Patna. I appreciate the
difficulty of the Sindhi friends. But Patna has been chosen after
much consultation and for the convenience of the majority of the
members. The real Puja holiday commences on the 24th and I have
promised the Bengali friends that, even though there may have to be a
late night sitting, I shall finish the deliberations of the All-India
Congress Committee on the 22nd so as to free the members to leave for
Calcutta the night of 22nd. If any  routine matters requiring the
attention of the All-India Congress Committee remain over, and on

representative began by asking about Gandhiji’s outstanding
impressions of his Bengal tour and he replied that so far as khaddar
was concerned, the thing that counted most, the province in general
showed as much enthusiasm for khaddar and as much disposition to work
out the programme as any other province. It might even do more. Asked
what advice he had given or would give to the Bengal Swarajists with
regard to the policy in the Legislative Council, he replied that he
had only advised them to follow the lead of Pandit Motilal Nehru.

Dadabhai justly earned the affectionate title of the G.O.M. of India.
Was it not he who first introduced us to the problem of the deep
poverty of the masses? In discovering the growing poverty of the
masses Dadabhai put his finger upon the root evil of the present
system of Government. In my opinion, therefore, the best way we can
celebrate the forthcoming Centenary is to do something tangible for
dealing with the problem of poverty. It cannot be dealt with</p>

and khaddar. Hence it is that I have unhesitatingly recommended the
celebration of the Centenary by making collections for khaddar and
charkha, by holding khaddar exhibitions, by hawking khaddar and in
every becoming manner pushing forward the cause of khaddar and the
spinning-wheel, in other words the cause of the millions.</p>

The more I study the problem of protecting cows, the more I realize
its importance. This problem will become increasingly serious in
India, since it involves the economic well-being of the country. I
believe that from its very nature religion embraces economic,
political and other problems. The religion which is opposed to true
economics is no religion, nor that which is opposed to true politics.
Economics devoid of religion should be shunned, and political power
uninformed with the spirit of religion is Satanic. There is no such
thing as dharma unrelated to economic and other activities.
Individuals and society, both survive through dharma and perish
without it. Accumulation of wealth, that is commerce, through
truthful means fosters the growth of society, but commerce carried on
without any regard for  truth destroys it. Many instances can be
cited to show that what is gained through falsehood, through
dishonest and devious means is but shortlived and proves harmful in
the end.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
Hence, while discussing our duty to protect cows we must consider its
economic aspect as well. If cow-protection is opposed to true
economics, we have no choice but to give up the effort. Not only
that, but we shall discover in that case that we cannot succeed in
protecting cows even if we wish to do so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
It is because we have not even thought about the economic benefits of
cow-protection that, in a country where countless people regard the
protection of the cow and her offspring as a sacred duty,</p>

the latter starve. We see them reduced to mere skin and bone, so much
so that all their bones can be counted, and they are slaughtered only
because of the indifference of Hindus. Cow-protection involves the
very existence of Indian agriculture. Cow-slaughter would cease if
every Hindu understood the economics of Cow-protection. The
destruction of cows through the sheer stupidity of Hindus must be a
hundred times greater than their slaughter in the name of religion.
So long as Hindus themselves do not understand the right method of
protecting cows, not all the crores of rupees which they can spend
will save the latter.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
In Gujarat, <i>Banias</i>, <i>Bhatias </i>and Marwaris take interest
in the cause of cow-protection. They spend large sums on it. And even
among them the Marwaris, especially, go to great lengths, Marwari
business men run the largest number of <i>goshalas </i>in India. They
cheerfully contribute lakhs of rupees towards these and it is for
this reason that I have said that the problem of protecting cows
cannot be solved without the help of Marwaris. I have often visited 
<i>goshalas</i>, but  I cannot say that I saw any which was an ideal
one.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
These reflections were provoked by my visit to the <i>goshala </i>at
Liluah in Calcutta. Two and a half lakh rupees are spent on it every
year, but the return is practically nil. A <i>goshala </i>which gets
two and a half lakh rupees every year should be able to save the
lives of not less than 10,000 head of cattle in a year. Even the
cattle tended by this institution do not come to so many. The
organizers are not to be blamed for this, nor are they dishonest. The
secretary who took me round to show the institution is serving it to
the best of his ability. The system itself is to blame for this
result. We do not know how to run such institutions, and so the
people do not derive the fullest benefit from them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Practical ability is not considered necessary in matters concerning
religion. Such institutions are regarded as well run simply if those
who manage them do not misappropriate funds. In a business firm in
which additional capital of two and a half lakh rupees is invested
every year, the best available paid workers are employed, whereas in
this case persons engaged in their own business spare some of their
time as a social duty. Those who do so deserve to be congratulated,
but their work does not help the cause of cow- protection. This cause
requires full-time services of able and efficient persons. Only men
of spiritual knowledge who live a life of self-denial</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
and self-sacrifice will offer such services, or able, worldly men if
properly paid. It would not matter if those who donate money for
charitable purposes are not practical persons, but those who run
charity institutions must be more capable and hard-working than even
business men. All the moral rules which apply to business men also
apply to charitable institutions. if <i>goshalas </i>were run as
commercial concerns, men with scientific knowledge of such matters
would be working in them, and they would daily conduct new
experiments and save the lives of more and more cows, would carry out
many experiments about rearing cattle in <i>goshalas </i>and about
ensuring the purity and increasing the quantity of milk. It is quite
obvious that the knowledge about rearing cattle which can be obtained
through <i>goshalas </i>cannot be got elsewhere. Since, however, they
are charity institutions, they are not being run properly and no one
is concerned about them. It would be slighting the Vedas if schools
which are meant to teach them taught us the least about them; the
present-day <i>goshalas </i>are in the same condition.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I have doubts whether the <i>goshala </i>at Liluah is properly
located. That the buildings are not of the right kind can be judged
even by a layman like me who knows nothing about the scientific
method of running <i>goshalas</i>. There are no instruments there for
examining the quality of the milk and other products. There is no one
there who can say whether it is possible to increase the yield of
milk. The institution seems to be the responsibility of no one. I
would advice those who are in charge of it to consult experts in the
management of <i>goshalas </i>and employ paid workers who know their
job and leave it to them to run it. Institutions of this kind should
train people in rearing cattle and bullocks, provide instruction in
regared to improved techniques of castration, cattle feed and the
methods of growing them, hygienic processes of obtaining milk and of
removing skin and processing it. So long as there is indifference in
those matters, we should feel that <i>goshalas </i>are not being put
to the best use. We should feel ashamed even if a single cow or
bullock dies an untimely death or is exported.  I am convinced that
this can be easily prevented through <i>goshalas.</i></p>

	What you have written about irregularity, etc., is correct. I intend
	to discuss that part of it in <i>Navajivan</i>. Maybe it can be done
	next week. I have no doubt at all that there is nothing sinful in

	actions, the sin lies in the intention, not in the act. A thing done
	with an innocent heart is never sinful. Of course, with regard to
	such behaviour it has been said that even if an act is pure, it
	should be abandoned if it incurs popular disapproval. For instance,
	the solar hat is absolutely harmless. It has many advantages in the
	summer. Nevertheless, I feel that if people do not approve of it, it

I am pleased to hear the report of your work and I offer you my
congratulations. I have observed the activities of your schools
during my tours. I see what classes of children are taught here and
what sort of education is imparted to them. Nowhere else have  I 
seen  the orderly management found in these schools. This does not
mean that  I have some sort of partiality for these schools. Since
there is such a possibility, I have made allowance for it. And so I
should like to stick to my opinion. This appreciation is not meant to
flatter you. I have expressed it because it is well deserved. My duty
is rather to point out your defects than to congratulate you. I can
see clearly your efforts at strict observance of the rules of
cleanliness, but I would urge you to look at the problem from my
view-point. I was shocked to find dirt in the nails of the girl
there. It is uncleanliness; it is a wrong thing. The roll-call is not
complete until the nails, teeth, etc. of every child are inspected.
We contract perhaps more diseases through the nails and teeth than
otherwise. These two things are most serviceable and it is easy to
maintain them in good condition. Do not yield any scope here for “as
far as possible”. The cleanliness of the nose and eyes is of lesser
importance. The children themselves will learn to take care of them.
It is necessary to inspect their hair also.</p>

I congratulate you on your work with the <i>takli</i>. No national
school has, I think, made so much progress in this respect. I add my
own experience of the <i>takli </i>to yours. It was a wrong
experiment to have introduced in the school the spinning-wheel which
does not possess the potency of the <i>takli</i>. Even if the
spinning-wheel is completely destroyed, the <i>takli </i>has the
potency to bring about  a boycott of foreign cloth. The
spinning-wheel is a nuisance though it does good. It is an ornament
to a hut. The <i>takli </i>is an ornament only to  a school. It is a
top which is useful. I congratulate you also on having such a large
number of children here.</p>

in his speech laid especial stress on the labourers’ duty. He knew
they had grievances about insufficient water supply, lack of dining
sheds, proper cleaning of latrines, beatings and ill-treatment by
jobbers and numerous breakages of ends in the throstle department and
consequent less work and less wages. But he was sure that some of the
things depended on themselves, on their cultvation of proper
self-respect. He was glad to note that the Union had redeemed the
debts of some of them and substituted cheap loans for loans on
exorbitant rates of interest. But it was a sad commentary on their
way of life that they should have to borrow so much. Their wages may
be insufficient, but he had no doubt that if they were more thrifty,
free from drink and other evil habits, they would not have to be
indebted. He was very glad that the mill-hands recognized the

The boys and girls learn all the subjects taught in the ordinary

at first tried the wheels. Among so many boys and girls, the wheels
were found to be too expensive and inconvenient because of the space

Indeed, the schools will compare favourably with any primary schools

necessity of cleanliness and tidiness among the scholars. It requires

commencing the classes and examine their teeth, nails, ears, eyes,

An esteemed friend, jealous of my reputation for correct conduct,
asks how it is that I feel confident of my being right in my latest
attitude of whole-hearted support to the Swaraj Party. Have I not
made Himalayan blunders? Do I not notice, the friend asks, that many
of my No-changer friends are bewildered over what to them appears to
be my inconsistency? Might I not be guilty of over-confidence?</p>

I do not think so. For a man of truth must ever be confident, if he
has also equal need to be diffident. His devotion to truth demands
the fullest confidence. His consciousness of the fallibility of human
nature must make him humble and therefore ever ready to retrace his
steps immediately he discovers his error. It makes no difference  to
his confidence that he had peviously made Himalayan blunders. His
confession and penance make him, if anything, stronger for future
action. Discovery of errors makes the votary of truth more cautious
of believing things and forming  things and forming conclusions, but
once he has made up his mind, his conscience must remain unshaken.
His errors may result in men’s reliance  upon his judgments  being
shaken, but he must not doubt the truth of his position once he has
come to a conclusion. It should further be borne in mind that my
errors have been errors of calculation and judging men, not in
appreciating the true nature of truth and ahimsa or in their
application. Indeed these errors and my prompt confessions have made
me surer, if possible, of my insight into the implications of truth
and ahimsa. For I am convinced that my action in suspending civil
disobedience at Ahmedabad, Bombay and Bardoli has advanced the cause
of India’s freedom and world’s peace. I am convinced that because
of the suspensions we are nearer swaraj than we would have been
without, and this I say in spite of despair being written in thick
black letters on the horizon. Such being my deep conviction, I cannot
help being confident of my present position as regards Swarajists and
other matters. It is traceable to one source only, a lively
understanding of the implications of truth and ahimsa.</p>

This is in many respects a remarkable experiment. Quiet work has gone
on without fuss, without advertisement, and practically without
capital and this has been possible because the people were willing to
revise their taste in dress material and to make use of their idle
hours. The population of the village is 640. The cloth budget is
estimated at Rs. 3,640. Therefore, when all the villagers are clothed
in khaddar, they will add to their annual income Rs. 3,640 by simply
using their waste moments. There is no village reconstruction scheme
which can possibly yield such brilliant, tangible and quick results.
This khaddar work is also an object-lesson in co-operation. And by
the time khaddar becomes a permanent part of the village life,
selfless village workers can, if they will, promote sanitation,
education and social reform. This is practical self-government.
Imagine thousands of such villages bound together by a common tie
through khaddar, and you have swaraj for the asking. For when India
learns to deny itself the use of foreign cloth, she will have
sterilized the many undesirable activities of the British people and
paved the way for real swaraj. I hope that the good people of Kanur
will not rest content till every man, woman and child living in it
habitually wears khaddar. It is to be hoped, too, that the infection
will not be confined to Pudur only, but that it will spread from
village to village.</p>

Friends have been inquiring whether they may still pay their
subscription to the All-Bengal Memorial Fund. So far as the official
collection is concerned, it was closed on the 31st ultimo. But if
there are any who still wish to pay to <i>that </i>fund, they can do
so through the Trustees. But whatever may now be received by me will
be credited to the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial unless the
subscriber directs to the contrary.</p>

I read your letter carefully in the train. I understand  your
suffering and appreciate your arguments. But even so, it seems to me
that you should certainly take an injection and even after doing so,
try to control your impure thoughts. Be constantly alert for that
purpose. There will be no difficulty in sending you to a place like
Almora. But that will be considered later. For the present, watch the
effect of the injection and avoid fatiguing exertion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.78cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
In fact, if you can make yourself completely free from impure
thoughts, you will not need even the  <i>chiretta</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>. All of us should try to attain that state. Surely one
of us will succeed in it. Rarely do we find anyone in the world who
is pure even in his thoughts. Nothing is impossible for such a
person. I wish you to make greater effort than others in that
direction.</p>

the general rule is not to take up any work. There can be only a few
exceptions to this. Where the aim is to spread a completely new idea,
help from outside may be taken for a certain period, but this cannot
be a permanent practice. The service of <i>Antyajas </i>is a cause of
this nature. It is a sacred duty. It is possible that local help may
not be available for such work in the initial stages. In that case,
workers may secure it from other sources. But no such help can be
expected from  a popularly elected body like the Provincial
Committee. The worker should rely on his own influence with people.
This rule, however, cannot be followed in the matter of the education
of the people. If the residents of a village want facilities for
education, they must provide the necessary funds. If they do not do
so, we may conclude that no such institution is required there. Very
often, the fault lies with theworker. He may lack strength of
character, or ability or may not be hard-working. Such a worker
should have patience. He should reform his character, acquire ability
through experience and make an effort to be hard-working. This is
what we mean by <i>tapascharya</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt"><i>1

there right before us; I would, therefore, strongly advise co-workers
to try to obtain local help and wherever this is not available, to
limit the field of their work.</p>

Let us consider the limits of the Provincial Committee. Where does it
get its funds from? From the districts. What would happen if all the
districts looked to it for help and contributed nothing to its funds?
The rule is that every area should contribute to the funds of the
Provincial Committee and then ask for help from it. I would advise
the Provincial Committee to wind up its work if it, too, has to carry
it on with funds obtained from outside Gujarat. For this very reason
I have always advocated that Gujarat should depend primarily on
Gujaratis’ money. This is the secret of swaraj. Local autonomy
implies local responsibility. We should not be too eager to run a
single institution</p>

out of a false sense of prestige. Dharma is the only thing we can
pursue in opposition to public opinion, and to pursue dharma means to
lay down one’s life. This does not require any monetary help. Can
running a library or a school possibly be one’s dharma? Non-co-
operation can be. We may bear hardships in employing it. It requires
no monetary help whatsoever. If the residents of a village do not
wish to get their children educated by me, there should be no
question at all of my attracting the children to me against their
wishes. If they are ready to send their children but not prepared to
contribute funds, that means that they beg for charity. They will get
it only if they need it. <i>Antyajas </i>are such a class of people,
for we have neglected our duty towards them so far. It is, therefore,
useless to expect help from the Provincial Committee in every matter.
If the latter gives any help under pressure, it would be doing a
wrong and may have even to stop business. I know at first hand that
some Provincial Committees are reduced to such straits. Gujarat is
not in such a plight because its workers weigh everything most
carefully in carrying on their work and continually walk on the
razor’s edge. They are ever vigilant.</p>

Corruption has gradually entered our public life. A learned gentleman
has remarked that our public life has become corrupted ever since the
Congress got one crore rupees. There  was  intense malice in this
criticism, but it also contained a drop of nectar. With money in the
Congress treasury, temptation followed and laxity came over its
working. Why should we work ourselves, [we thought] for what we can
obtain with money? Vices do not trumpet their coming. They work as
thieves and poisonous germs do. They enter stealthily, without our
being aware of their coming. They creep in and lodge themselves as an
innocent lamb would creep unnoticed into your home. We cannot get rid
of them, however much we try. If we are not on our guard, they pull
at us and draw us behind them. Unknown to us, corruption has entered
us. It is necessary to be on our guard against it.</p>

Many people have borrowed money from the [Provincial] Committee. This

returned. This is laxity and means an indirect breach of trust. If we
had obtained similar facilites on business terms and failed to repay
the sums in time, we would have had to suffer punishment by being
sent to prison. We seem to believe, however, that we need not follow
business standards in repaying money borrowed from public bodies like
the [Provincial] Committee.</p>

Really speaking, the position should be that the money due to the
Committee should be regarded as a loan received on one’s credit. In
English such a debt is known as a debt of honour, or, in other words,
money obtained on one’s credit as a man of one’s word and it is a
law among business men, a law of the world, that such debt should be
repaid at the earliest opportunity. One should be  particularly
anxious to repay it. There is another law, too, namely, that the
King’s tax should be paid before a private debt. This should be the
law whichone should follow in regard to the money borrowed from the
Committee, otherwise the Committees cannot continue to function. Our
laxity may suggest to us many excuses, but none will serve. We
deserve no admiration if we refrain from crimes for which the world
would punish us; there certainly is no virtue in such conduct. It is
no test of our truthfulness. He alone is a man of truth who saves
himself from a crime to which God would be the only witness.
Innocence consists in voluntarily refraining from a crime for which
the world would not punish us. There is no merit in forced charity or
one done through fear. Thus, from whatever point of view we look at
the matter, our duty is clear, and that is that all those who have
received loans from the Committee or other public bodies should wake
up, shake off their lethargy and repay the loans without any further
delay.</p>

should give up their habit of defecating at any and every place

only fixed places for this purpose. At present we do quite the
opposite of this and do not even hesitate to dirty our courtyards or
our streets. There is, in</p>

consequence, an excess of foul smell and it becomes difficult even to
walk. In villages, one should go to the fields which have been fixed
for such use or go to one’s own fields, and after defecation one
should invariably throw dry earth over the faeces. The best way of
doing this is to dig a hole with a small shovel or a spade and, after
defecation, fill up the hole with the mud so dug up. If, in addition,
people follow the practice of marking such spots by fixed signs,
everyone would know them. In order to ensure privacy in following
this method, a few places should be selected for use.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
If people understand this and co-operate in following such a method,
the necessary arrangements can be made easily and without expense.
Really speaking, such a method would add to the nation’s wealth at
no cost of labour and bring about improvement in public health. It is
the experience of the whole world that the productivity of the field
which is used for such purposes increases. If the people welcome this
idea, they would actually offer to pay for their fields being put to
such use. They do that in other countries. In our country, too, in
certain parts we see peasants securing a monopoly of removing the
night-soil, but they remove it in such a dirty manner that one feels
disgusted at the sight of it. If my suggestion is followed, no one
would need to remove night-soil, the air would not become polluted
and villages would remain very clean.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
This is with regard to villages. The same practice cannot be followed
in cities. They must have lavatories. It is not necessary to say
anything about cities which have Western-style water-closets and 
where the night-soil is collected through sewers at one place. All
that needs to be considered is what people can do on their own. They
should voluntarily observe the following rules.</p>

How can we ensure the observance of all these rules? The answer is,
through education. Laws are useless so long as people do not
understand them and do not recognize their necessity. A law can be
passed to compel only a small numebr of persons. The penalty
prescribed by a law which is either not understood or not obeyed by a
large number of people serves no useful purpose.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Literacy is not essential for such education. Through magic lanterns
and lectures, people should be told about the diseases which spread
through filth and about the advantages of saving night-soil for use
as manure. Different ways of doing this should be demonstrated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The best method of education, however, is to show the way through
one’s own practice. Those who have been convinced of the necessity
of putting these suggestions into practice should do so and set an
example to others.</p>

conviction that one does not become bad or despised simply because
one cleans night-soil. The mother always does so for her child, but
society never condemns her as an untouchable. Untouchables  are
really those who do evil acts, and whose heart is not pure. I
therefore want to tell my <i>Dom </i>brothers and sisters and  others
 of  the untouchable class that they should hate neither Hindus nor
their religion. Hindus are trying their best to find out remedies and
make amends for the ill-treatment meted out by them to the <i>Doms
</i>and members of the other untouchable class. There are to be found
all over the country Hindus at the present time, who have dedicated
their whole time to the cause of ameliorating the condition of the
untouchables.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But I have a request to make to the untouchables. I must ask you to
eradicate those evils which have crept into your society. During my
tour in Bengal, I came in contact with many untouchable brethren,
from the United Provinces and Bihar. From them I came to know that
they were addicted to the habits of drinking and gambling. It is true
that nowadays other Hindus too, even Brahmins, are subject to these
vices of drinking and gambling. But let us not imitate the evils in
others. I therefore appeal to my <i>Dom </i>and other untouchable
brothers and sisters that, for God’s sake, they should shun the
evils in them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 1.02cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have also come to know from none else but yourselves that you all

You might be acquainted, if you have known Tulsidas’s <i>Ramayana</i>,
with the fact that Ramachandra, Sita and Lakshman had very
affectionately embraced the untouchable Guha and I want to see the
same repeated once again in India. Let even those who are known as 
<i>Chandals</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   
</font></sup>eradicate the evils  in  them  and  become  the 
devotees ofShri Ramachandra. I would also request you to shun the use
of foreign clothes and take to the use of hand-woven clothes made of
hand-spun yarn. You should bear in mind that, in the days of Shri
Ramachandra, neither rich nor poor used any foreign cloth and the
khadi produced in the country was in the general use of all.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.54cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Further, I would like to tell my other brothers besides the
untouchables, who are present here, that untouchability has got no
place in the Hindu religion.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
My personal belief is strong about it. The moment I am convinced that
untouchability is an essential element of Hindu religion, I would
immediately renounce my religion. We regard the Shastras and the
Vedas as divine revelations. How can then a divine revelation
advocate any hatred against members of a particular community? So
long as the Hindus continue just to tolerate the untouchables among
them and treat them with contempt, the nation would continue to be
treated as untouchables by other nations, as is the case today.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.51cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
And thus also I believe and trust we will not be able to attain
swaraj unless we are able to purge the Hindu society of this evil of
untouchability. <i>Ramayana </i>and Tulsidas have preached the
religion of kindness. I would therefore appeal to Hindus of the
higher castes present here that, if they call themselves
<i>sanatanadharmi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2 </font></sup><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">,

I had a visit by appointment on the 8th instant during my brief stay
at Sabarmati at 4 o’clock in the morning from the Indian Hercules,
as Professor Rama Murti delights to describe himself. He engaged me
in an entertaining conversation on the wickedness of modern Brahmins
and drew from me questions that seemed to give him full satisfaction,
and there seemed to be, for the  moment,  a kinship between our
non-Brahmin souls and a vision was opened out before him of a
non-Brahmin war to the knife against the Brahmins who, as he said,
after all represented but a microscopic minority.</p>

concerned himself about my bodily vigour and initiated me into the
mysteries of ‘healthy mind in healthy body’. He found in me a
very willing convert. The exercises which he gave me were delightful
but I am inclined to think that they were a trifle too much for one
like me who has passed the meridian of life. He claimed for them a
superiority over all the European methods, which certificate I
heartily endorsed. The exercises were nothing but a few <i>Hatha Yoga
 </i>practices.I commend them to all young men. <i>Pranayam </i>has a
great health-giving value if practised under skilled supervision. But
let there be no self- deception about it. Those who practise these
exercises should do so for the purpose of health and that only. They
have, no  doubt, restricted spiritual value. But I would strongly
dissuade young men from going in for  <i>Hatha  Yoga  </i>practices
for spiritual regeneration.  In the present age such regeneration
comes more from heart-devotion than through physical practices. And
for acquiring spiritual merit through <i>Hatha Yaga </i>one needs a
preceptor who is himself a spiritual adept through these practices. I
have searched for such and I have failed. That does not necessarily
mean that there are no pure <i>Hatha </i><i>Yogis </i>in India, but
where a diligent searcher like  me  has  not succeeded, let young men
beware of accepting claimants without severe examination.</p>

But I have gone astray, I must redeem the promise I have made to the
Professor when he sent me a digest of our political talk for revision
that I would give the substance myself in these columns  instead of
revising his own reproduction which I received at a time when I had
not a moment to spare. He told me that, at Municipal and
District-Board elections, my name was being unlawfully exploited by
those who described themselves as Congressmen or Swarajists and told
me also that on that account I was losing my influence among the
masses. I informed him that I was not concerned with my influence and
that I could not help if people made an unlawful use of my name. But,
retorted the Professor, could I not at least guide the voters by
saying what I wanted them to do. I told him that I had done so
already on more occasions than one. For me mere Congress label was of
no avail. I could only give my vote, if at all, to those who were
Congressmen or Swarajists in reality and, therefore, I would give my
vote to those who believed in the Congress creed, who habitually wore
hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar, who believed in unity among all
classes and, if Hindus, were active champions of the so-called
untouchables and believed that untouchability was an evil to be</p>

removed without delay, who were total prohibitionists as  to
intoxicating drinks and drugs, and who otherwise conformed to the
Congress resolutions. If I found no such candidates, I would keep my
vote with myself. Not to give the vote is as much an exercise of the
privilege of the voter as the giving of it.</p>

The Professor then asked me for my definition of a Brahmin. I told
him that a Brahmin was one who sacrificed himself  for  his religion
and his country and who accepted poverty as his happy lot in life for
the sake of service. “Are there any such Brahmins?” quickly asked
the Professor. “Not many,” I answered, “but more, perhaps, than
you expect.”</p>

The passages removed by me were not necessary to elucidate the
meaning of the correspondent or give point to it. They were offensive
without being useful or necessary. There seems to be the fashion to
think that, in order to be truthful, one must use harsh language;
whereas truth suffers when it is harshly put. It is like wanting to
support strength; truth being itself fully strong is insulted when an
attempt is made to support it with harshness. I see no conflict
between the Sanskrit text and Garrison’s motto quoted by the
correspondent . In my opinion, the Sanskrit text means that one
should speak the truth in gentle language. One had better not speak
it if one cannot do so in a gentle way, meaning thereby that there is
not truth in a man who cannot control his tongue. In other words,
truth without non-violence is not truth but untruth. Garrison’s
motto requires to be interpreted in</p>

Mark his language. He will be as harsh as truth, but since truth to
be truth is never harsh but always gentle and beneficial, the motto
can only mean that Garrison would be as gentle as truth but no more.
Both the texts have relation to the inner state of the speaker or
writer, not to the effect that will be produced upon those to whom
the speech or the writing is addressed. The <i>Indian </i><i>Social
</i><i>Reformer </i>is rarely, if ever, harsh. It tries to be fair
though it often jumps to conclusions in a hurry and is obliged later
to revise its estimate of men and things. In these days of
surrounding bitterness one cannot be too cautious. After all who
knows the  absolute  truth?  It  is  in ordinary affairs of life only
a relative term. What is truth to me is not necessarily truth to the
rest of my companions. We are all like the blind men who, on
examining an elephant, gave different descriptions of the same animal
according to the touch they were able to have of him. And they were
all, according to their own lights, in the right. But we know also
that they were all in the wrong. Every one of them fell far short of
the truth. One cannot be too insistent therefore upon the necessity
of guarding oneself against bitterness. Bitterness blurs the vision
and to that extent disables one from seeing even the limited truth
that the physically blind men in the fable were able to do.</p>

There is room for a third reason. I do not consider that Councils

cannot do without the Council programme. The  most  forward amongst
them will gladly retire if they had a fiercely active political

programme. It is too slow for them. I recognize the honesty of this
attitude. And as one wanting to harness all the forces for the good

It is a privilege for me to enjoy the friendship of so many unknown
American and European friends. It pleases me to note that the circle
is ever widening, perhaps more especially in America. I had the
pleasure of receiving a warm invitation about a year ago to visit
that continent. The same invitation has now been repeated with
redoubled strength and with the offer to pay all expenses.  I  was 
unable then as I am now, to respond to the kind invitation. To accept
it is an easy enough task, but I must resist the temptation, for I
feel that I can make no effective appeal to the people of that great
continent unless I make my position good with the intellectuals of
India.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
I have not a shadow of doubt about the truth of my fundamental
position. But I know that I am unable to carry with me the bulk of
educated India. I can therefore gain no effective help for my country
from the Americans and Europeans so long as I remain isolated from
educated India. I do want to think in terms of the whole world. My
patriotism includes the good of mankind in general. Therefore, my
service of India includes the service of humanity. But I feel that I
should be going out of my orbit if I left it for help from the West.
I must be satisfied for the time being with such help as I can get
from the West, speaking to it from my smaller Indian platform. If I
go to America or to Europe, I must go in my strength, not in my
weakness, which I feel today,—the weakness I mean, of my country.
For the whole scheme for the liberation of India is based upon  the
development of internal strength. It is a plan of self-purification.
The peoples of the West, therefore, can best help the Indian movement
by setting apart specialists to study the inwardness of it. Let the
specialists come to India with an open mind and in a spirit of
humility as befits</p>

a searcher after Truth. Then, perhaps, they will see the reality
instead  of a glorified edition that, in spite of all my desire to be
absolutely truthful, I am likely to present if I went to America. I
believe in thought-power more than in the power of the word, whether
written or spoken. And if the movement that I seek to represent has
vitality in it and has divine blessing upon it, it will permeate the
whole world without my physical presence in its different parts.
Anyway, at the present moment I see no light before me. I must
patiently plod in India until I see my way clear for going outside
the Indian border.</p>

After pressing the invitation, the American friend puts a number of
questions for my consideration. I welcome them and gladly take the
opportunity of answering them through these columns. He says:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Whether

<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.41cm">His
first question is:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Has
the time arrived—or is it coming—when your best way to help India
will be by moving the whole world—and especially England and
America—to a new consciousness?</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
I have partly answered the question already. In my opinion the time
has not yet arrived—it may come any day—for me to go out of India
to move the whole world to a new consciousness. The process, however,
is even now indirectly and unconsciously going on though slowly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">Are
not the present-day interests of all mankind, everywhere, so

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
I do believe with the writer that no single country can remain in
isolation for any length of time. The present plan for securing
swaraj is not to attain a position of isolation but one of full
self-realization and self-expression for the benefit of all. The
present position of bondage and helplessness hurts not only India,
not only England, but the whole world.</p>

If I can say so without arrogance and with due humility, my message
and methods are indeed in their essentials for the  whole world and
it gives me keen satisfaction to know that it has already received a

and practise the spinning-wheel unless they will do so  out  of 
sympathy or for discipline or with a view to applying their matchless
inventive faculty to making the spinning-wheel a better instrument
while retaining its essential characteristic as a cottage industry.
But the message of the spinning-wheel is much wider than its
circumference. Its message is one of simplicity, service of mankind,
living so as not to hurt others, creating an indissoluble bond
between the rich and the poor, capital and labour, the prince and the
peasant. That larger message is naturally for all.</p>

to spiritualize the machinery—because that seems to me an
impossible task—but to introduce, if it is at all possible, a human
or the humane spirit among the men behind the machinery. Organization
of machinery for the purpose of concentrating  wealth and power in 
the hands of a few and for the exploitation of many I hold to be
altogether wrong. Much of the organization of machinery of the
present age is of that type. The movement of the spinning-wheel is an
organized attempt to displace machinery from that state of
exclusiveness and exploitation and to place it in its proper state.
Under my scheme, therefore, men in charge of machinery will think not
of themselves or even of the nation to which they belong but of the
whole human race. Thus Lancashire men will cease to use their
machinery for exploiting India and other countries but, on the
contrary, they will devise means of enabling India to convert in her
own villages her cotton into cloth. Nor will Americans under my
scheme seek to enrich themselves by exploiting the other races of the
earth through their inventive skill.</p>

time is perhaps not yet. Probably it will not be before India has
found her own soul. Nothing will please me more than to find America
and Europe making the difficult path of India as easy as it is
possible for them to do. They can do so by withdrawing the
temptations in India’s way and by encouraging her in her attempt to
revive her ancient industries in her own villages.</p>

I have no false modesty about me. If I felt the call within, I would
not wait a single second but straightway respond to an invitation so
cordial as this. But with my limitations of which I am painfully
conscious, I feel somehow that my experiment must be restricted to a
fragment. What may be true of the fragment is likely to be true of
the whole. It is true indeed that India’s progress in the direction
I desire seems to have come to a pause but I think that it only seems
so. The little seed that was sown in 1920 has not perished. It is, I
think, taking deep root. Presently it will come out as a stately
tree. But if I am labouring under a delusion, I fear that no
artificial stimulus that my visit to America may temporarily bring
can revive it. I am pining for the assistance of the whole world. I
see it coming. The urgent invitation is one of the many signs. But I
know that we shall have to deserve it before it comes upon us like a
mighty flood, a flood that cleanses and invigorates.</p>

	In ordinary affairs of life we are made to fulfil the pledges we

	carries with it a penalty.  A voluntary promise made to a voluntary
	organization imposes in well-organized societies a stricter
	obligation of the giver of the promise than a promise made in a
	commercial transaction. Thus debts of honour have a prior claim for
	fulfilment than debts en- forcible at law. But somehow or other,

have no faith in khadi will no doubt argue that the Gujarat figures
are an eloquent testimony to the complete failure of the spinning
franchise. I should venture to join issue with such objectors. The
spinning franchise has enabled us to lay our finger on the weakest
spot. Let it be known that even the four-anna franchise fared  no
better.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.5cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
Those who registered their names once did not come the second time to
pay of their own accord. And had there been a monthly subscription we
would have found almost as many defaulters as we have found among
spinners. But pecuniary obligation is a totally different proposition
from the obligation to work from day to day. Swaraj is not a
pecuniary transaction. It is not to be bought with money. It has to
be bought with solid, sustained, vigorous work. And I venture to
suggest that we would have noticed the same result, if, instead of
spinning, the Congress had imposed the obligation to mend pencils for
half an hour every day. The lesson, therefore, that I draw from a
study of these figures is that we must preserve along the same lines
that we commenced at Belgaum if we are to make the Congress a
working, effective and powerful organization. In all probability
compulsory spinning will be done away with, but if the Congress
retains spinning as an alternative franchise, the effort to make it
effective should in no way be relaxed. Out of a population of three
hundred millions, we should not have difficulty in finding a few lacs
of men and women who would willingly and with unfailing regularity
labour for the nation. Spinning is the form chosen because of its
great national value and its simplicity. I have not burdened the
reader with the detailed working of the franchise in the different
districts of Gujarat. The Provincial Congress Committee’s report
does contain a detailed study. The Committee’s organization is so
thorough and so honest that, if the strength of the people is
properly brought out, their weakness is never suppressed. The
detailed study shows that even the five hundred and forty members who
are still paying their full quota are not distributed over all
Gujarat. But they are drawn from the five spinning organizations, for
want of which there would not be even five hundred and forty members
remaining. Spinning organizations all over India are therefore a
necessity, if voluntary spinning is to be universal.</p>

could use the world Satan. But I have observed in him a disposition
to draw me out on many matters about which there is a likelihood of
the slightest misunderstanding or about which a greater elucidation
may be considered necessary. In my opinion the beauty of Hinduism
lies in its all-embracing inclusiveness. What the divine author of
the <i>Mahabharata </i>said of his great creation is eaually true of
Hinduism. What of substance is contained in any other religion is
always to be found in Hinduism. And what is not contained in it is
insubstantial or unnecessary. I do believe that there is room for
Satan in Hinduism. The Biblical conception is neither new nor
original. Satan is not a personality even in the Bible. Or he is as

Bible as Ravana or the whole brood of the <i>Asuras </i>is in
Hinduism.I no more believe in a historical Ravana with ten heads and
twenty arms than in a historical Satan. And even as Satan and his
companions are fallen angels, so are Ravana and  his  companions
fallen angels or callthem gods, if you will. If it be a crime to
clothe evil passions and ennobling thoughts in personalities, it is a
crime for which perhaps Hinduism is the most responsible. For are not
the six passions referred to by my correspondent, and nameless
others, embodied in Hinduism? Who or what is Dhritarashtra and his
hundred sons? To the end of time imagination, that is, poetry, will
play a useful and necessary part in the human evolution. We shall
continue to talk of passions as if they were persons. Do they not
torment us as much as evil persons? Therefore, as in innumerable
other things, in the matter under notice the letter killeth, the
spirit giveth life.</p>

I have nothing set for you. I had no notion when I came here that I
would be called upon to address this gathering. I would, however,
venture to put before you some stray thoughts on social service. At
one of the meetings that I attended at Calcutta, I said that the
first necessity for social service was character that, unless a man
who aspires after social service has a character, to keep and to
lose, he is unfit for that service. Although apparently my life has
been a life of political turmoils, all those who at all know me will
tell you that it has been predominantly devoted to social service. I
am a lover of it and I have very often claimed to be an expert in
that line of work—if 30 years’ unbroken experience of service can
make one an expert.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
In my life, I have had the great privilege of a long association not
with dozens or even hundreds but of tens of hundreds of men and
women, both Indian and European, devoted to social service. In my
humble opinion, even political service of the true type is hardly
possible without social service, and it was at an early stage of my
career as a social servant, whilst I was in South Africa, more so
after I returned to India—that I realized the absolute necessity of
character for social service. For hard as it was in South Africa to
render social service the difficulties there were nothing compared to
the difficulties that confront one in India. Here one has to  battle 
against  a tremendous amount of superstition, prejudice and
conservatism. Conservatism is a good thing in its own way. It keeps a
man clean and on the right path, but when conservatism comes to be
allied to ignorance, prejudice and superstition, it becomes most
undesirable. Unfortunately, in India, a social worker finds himself
confronted by this trinity of evils at the very outset of his career.
The field for social service here is abundant and a man or woman who
wants to render social service has hardly to think what he or she
shall do. There are hundreds of things that await a social servant,
they obtrude themselves on his attention if he will only exercise his
faculty of observation, so that one may most truthfully say that here
more than anywhere else, the harvest is really rich and plentiful but
the labourers are few and, it  is really amazing that, even after all
these long years of education in</p>

It is true that in social service there is no excitement, no fire-
works display. It is all hard, plodding work. It is also true that it
has no pecuniary attraction about it; one has got to be satisfied
with a bare pittance and sometimes not even that. At present,
throughout the length and breadth of the land, there are young men,
some of them brilliant graduates, men of sterling character, who are
engaged in social service. But some of them have to live upon what
may be called starvation wages. But they do not regret it. They have
voluntarily abandoned lucrative careers and chosen their thorny but
beautiful path of duty and service which is its own reward and
satisfaction. The satisfaction which a man feels when he sees his
work of alleviating the distress of humanity prospered before him
from day to day gives to him a pleasure that is all its own. It gives
him a peace of the soul which he cannot get elsewhere. Let us,
therefore, explore the various branches of social service and examine
their possibilities. We will find  as soon as we do that, that there
is one fundamental fact which is common to all India and that is its
ever-deepening pauperism. It is acknowledged by all. Even those
Englishmen who belong to the Civil Service have stated in their
evidence that the poverty of India is most distressing and is
growing. They have also said that one-tenth of the population of
India is living in a state of semi-starvation, getting nothing but
stale chupatty and dirty salt. They do not know what milk is. They
have never tasted ghee, some of them may have tasted whey. They do
not get even oil. You who are studying in colleges and visit the
villages only rarely, have you ever thought that within a stone’s
throw of you in the village there are living men and women whose
poverty is most distressing, who hardly get enough to eat. Probably
you would not believe me if I told you all the misery that they
endure and, even if you believed me, you would not be able to form a
mental picture of it. If I were to take you with me throughout my
travels, all over the length and breadth of the country, outside the
railway’s beat, perhaps you would be able to understand what that
state of semi- starvation is whose results in degradation and filth
and helplessness. I have often met these men in the villages and
tried to tell them something about God and I confess to you that I
have come back from these talks absolutely humiliated. I said to
myself:I have no right to talk to these men about God before I can
give them bread to eat. These people do not know what God is. Their
God is their stomach.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Look at their faces. There is no lustre in their eyes. You talk to
them about work. They smile-nay deride, not smile.  They  cannot
understand why they should work at all. They have lost all hope, they
have almost come to regard starvation as their natural condition.
Such is their state of utter helplessness. Here among these men
then—and they are not few but millions and millions of them—there
is almost unlimited field for social service for all of you. In this
very district of Chota Nagpur, I learnt that there was a tribe called
the Ho, but I did not know all their customs and habits. These men,
in this province which should be flowing with milk and honey, which
is so nice in its climate and scenary, so rich in mineral resources,
I found, are forced to go to Assam to work on tea plantations. I do
not  mind  their  working on tea plantations if such be their need
but such is not their need. Among these backward tribes there is work
enough for all  young men. Here you have got a vast field for
research and investigation. Wonderful discoveries you will come
across in course of your research work— hidden cords underlying the
human breast whose presence you little suspected. And when you
succeed in touching some of these cords and find that they are
responsive to human touch, it will give you all the satisfaction that
a man can legitimately desire. I have often told young men that for
social service of a universal character they must have one thing. You
will laugh when I tell you what that one thing is and say that this
old man, whether he talks of politics or social service or
alleviating economic distress, cannot help harping upon the charkha.
Yes, it is true, I cannot help doing so. This time at Calcutta I was
privileged to meet a larger number of people, some of them engaged in
missionary work, others in commercial undertakings, and after all
these talks, my conviction has grown deeper that social service on a
large scale is impossible without a thorough knowledge of the science
of the charkha. The disease from which we as a nation are suffering
is idleness—enforced at one time, now grown in habit—and a nation
living in idleness does not deserve to live. The middle class people
will slave away for their maintenance for eight hours, but a man who 
slaves away like that  for 8 hours is not necessarily industrious.
They have no sense of time.  I know this to my cost. I have lived in
the midst of thousands of labourers in south Africa and, ever with my
rickety constitution, I was able to overtake them in their work
because they lost so many idle moments. A friend, who is a Collector,
once wrote to me; “I detest your politics,”—meaning
non-co-operation about which he had read</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
little, known less—but he loves the charkha. “As an Englishman I
do not understand Indian economics,” he wrote, “but I like this
hobby of yours because by delivering your message of the charkha, you
have rendered a great social service.” With me it is not a mere
hobby—though I should prize it even as a hobby—but a life-giving
thing which has revolutionized the lives of thousands of men and
women, and if I could carry you educated people with me, if I could
make the Englishman agree with me, millions of people should go with
a smile on their faces where there is a look of blank despair now.
And why? Simply because they have no work and so starve. They feel
the pinch of hunger, but they cannot go to the costly works that the
Government has opened for them. The work there mostly consists of
breaking stones for the roads or carrying metal. And what are the
conditions under which this work has to be done. The majority of them
are women and they have to work under the supervision of overseers,
who have no character to lose or to keep, and who are lustful. The
rest you can understand. I would not describe it to you. These women
who ought to be as dear to you as your mothers or sisters, if you
have any regard for them, have been weaned from this class of labour.
The charkha gives them all that they need. An old lady of 60 years
walks two miles to obtain slivers from my son and says, “Tell your
father he has given me something which is a blessing to me because it
has given me a dignity which  I  did  not have  before.” Today
there are millions of such men and women in Champaran to whom the
charkha would give independence.  The wages of women there are
anything between 5 and 6 pice per day, those of boys  between 3 and 4
pice and those of men between 8 to  10 pice. The average annual
income of an Indian today, I am told, is Rs. 50. I do not know that.
But I know that Dadabhai Naoroji calculated it at Rs. 26. The late
Lord Curzon, who challenged the accuracy of this figure, set it down
at Rs. 33. Even if we accept the late Lord Curzon’s figure,
including as it does, the crores of the  millionaires like the Tatas,
as correct, just consider what it would mean to put two to three
rupees per month in the pockets of these people. And through what
agency? Not the insolent overseers who rob these sisters of their
shame and take one rupee as their <i>dasturi </i>of the three rupees
that they give to them, but by working under the observation of clean
lads who will regard their honour as sacred as of their ownsisters
and give them money with a smile. It makes all the difference in the
world whether you receive 8 or 10 annas from</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
insolent hands or four pice from hands sanctified with work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
That is the dignity of the charkha. There are many other departments
of social service. But I have neither the time nor the energy to talk
about them to you. If some of you will be fired with the zeal to
render this kind of selfless and unassuming social service, you will
receive no applause, no Mahatmaship, no pecuniary reward— these, it
will not be your privilege to receive. But you will receive instead
the blessings of the poor people, a gift greater than riches and
treasure—a gift that descends upon you when God says: “Well done,
my faithful servant. I am well pleased with thy work.” You will, by
serving His dumb millions, be able to establish the closest bond of
relationship with your Maker. What greater mission can you have?
Nothing can be greater. May such be your lot!</p>

It seems a certain business man in Ahmedabad who is trading in tea,
puts out many advertisements. And in these my name has been used in
such a manner as to give an impression that I have been encouraging
his business or, that I approve of the habit of taking tea. I have
received four or five letters of complaints on this matter. I do not
wish to advertise his tea any further by giving the name and other
particulars of the dealer. It is sufficient to state that I have
given no certificate to any tea merchant in India for his tea. For
many years, I</p>

have not taken tea. I do not believe that it is essential for the
human body. Tea, if boiled, is harmful. I believe that much harm has
been done by people giving up milk because of tea. I do not approve
of tea also because the labourers in tea-gardens are subjected to
much hardship. Those who get addicted to tea feel nervous when  they 
cannot have it. It is better to give up a thing of this kind which
becomes an addiction. For those especially who wish to court impr-
isonment, it is best to give up tea, as it is not served in prison.
It is, therefore, improper to associate my name in any manner with
advertisements of tea, and it pains me to see this done. Hence, I
would ask those who have been using my name to remove it from their
advertisements.</p>

deal and explain many things. I do not feel disappointed by them, but
I find that even in Gujarat the spinning franchise has succeeded less

The spinning franchise was not forced upon us by the Government; the
Congress had introduced it after much deliberation. No one was
forced, either, to offer their names; people did so voluntarily.
Nevertheless, out of 2,580 persons only 580 have stayed on. What does
this imply? Does this not mean simply that people do not wish to
work? That, further, they attach no value to their words. If anyone
says that this is true only with regard to spinning, he is not right.
Even when members had to pay their subscriptions in cash, all those
who signed did not pay regularly. If we give up the spinning-</p>

same fate. Suppose for a moment that everyone is asked to make as
many pens from reeds as they can in half an hour’s time, and give

promise to do so will keep their promise. In this laxity lies the

As he would expect complete success, he would naturally feel
dissatisfied with anything less. In my opinion, Gujarat has done more
than the other provinces, but the difference is so insignificant that
no Gujarati should seek consolation in this fact. No one who wishes
to make progress should pride himself on having less to blame himself
for than others and be complacent; he should on the contrary,
continually examine himself for any shortcomings he may have, feel
ashamed of those which he may discover and try to remedy them. If,

It is indeed true that agriculture involves the destruction of
countless insects. But another statement, equally true, is  that  the
process of living, even respiration, involves violence of the same
kind. But just as by committing suicide one does not completely get
rid of the body, so also by refusing to take up agriculture one does
not abolish it. A human being is made of earth. His body springs from
the earth and derives its sustenance from the various forms which
earth takes. Anyone who lives by begging his food in order to avoid
the sin that is involved in agriculture commits a twofold sin. He is
guilty of the sin involved in agriculture since the food which he
begs was produced by the labour of some farmer. He who fills his
stomach by begging shares the sin of which that farmer is guilty by
virtue of his farming. Secondly, he is guilty of the sin of
harbouring ignorance and the indolence which results from it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
If it is desirable for one individual to keep away from agriculture,
it is so for all. If too many people live by begging their food, a
few poor farmers would be crushed under the burden of supporting
beggars. Who would have to answer for this sin, if not the latter?
Such essential work as farming is, like bodily functions, a form of
violence which cannot be avoided. Such violence does not cease to be
violence but, being unavoidable, is less sinful and, through
spiritual knowledge and devotion to God, man secures deliverance from
such sins and thereby also saves himself from the necessity of
violence of this kind. This is why, if man’s body is a form of
bondage for him, it is also a means of attaining deliverance.
Likewise, farming becomes a cause of bondage to anyone who takes it
up in order to become rich,</p>

No work or activity or profession is blameless. All essential work
involves the same degree of evil. Business in pearls or silk and the
profession of the goldsmith are far more sinful than agriculture
since these are not absolutely essential. They certainly involve much
violence. Pearls cannot be obtained without violence. Silkworms are
boiled. If one could ask the insects that are burnt in the blue flame
lighted by the goldsmith and if they could reply, we would get some
idea of the violence involved in this profession.</p>

It is our natural dharma to be careful not to destroy even an ant as
we walk. Anyone who walks on proudly, holding his head high and not
caring to look below, does not even give a thought to the innumerable
insects being crushed under his feet, wilfully commits a sin for
which there is no justification and opens the gates of hell for
himself. He cannot be compared to the farmers, who should be regarded
as relatively innocent. Countless numbers of these latter walk
carefully in order to spare the lives of ants and such other insects.
There is no pride in them, they are humble. They sustain the world by
their toil. Nine-tenths of the world’s people are engaged in 
agriculture, and this is to the good of the world. Agriculture is a
necessity and a form of pure sacrifice. Even the most conscientious
man can take it up, and anyone who gives up some inessential
occupation to take it up earns holy merit.</p>

some know Him as Krishna, others call Him Rahim, and yet others call
Him God. All these worship the same spiritual Being. However, just as
everyone does not like the same food so all these names do not find
acceptance with everyone. A person knows God by that name which is

lips but with the heart. That is why even the dumb, the stammerer and

who wishes sincerely to cultivate devotion to God should purify his
heart. Hanuman’s<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

his lips was the lord of his heart. It is faith which fills the sails

The correspondent’s question can now be answered. We can pray to
God by any name. As for the manner of praying one should pray with
one’s heart, and one can learn to pray in this manner by following
the path of service. In this age, those Hindus who serve the <i>Antyajas
</i>sincerely offer the best prayers. Whoever spins with love for the
poor among the Hindus and among Indians of other faiths also follows
the path of service and offers prayers from his heart.</p>

	heavy responsibility rested upon his shoulders because they had to
	revise one of the most important sections of the Congress
	constitution. He did not propose to give any ruling on the merits of
	the question as to whether the A.I.C.C. could revise the
	constitution, but wanted to leave the ultimate decision on it in the
	hands of the members themselves. He would give rulings on matters of
	procedure only. He emphasized the fact that the two questions of
	revising the franchise and of revoking the Pact<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"><i>2

	was for them to consider, in a free and frank manner but with

	so that in Cawnpore they might be ready to revise their national
	programme in a  manner conducive to the early attainment of  swaraj.</p>

Those who believed in civil disobedience wanted some evolution of
power, in India, something as a cohesive force. And therein lay the
political significance of khaddar. The All-India Spinners’
Association would invite Englishmen to be its members; it would
invite Sir Ali Imam to become its member if he agreed to put on
khaddar; it would invite the Maharaja of Bikaner to be its member if
he patronized khaddar. The All-India Spinners’ Association thus
would have the means and would have the strength to boycott foreign

The rough and coarse khaddar was not to their taste. But he did not
agree with them. The Mussalmans also were born in and belonged to
India. They also had the sense of humanity in them and they also felt
for these starving millions in the villages. He hoped they would also
take to khaddar as, in fact, many of them had already done. They
would be serving two purposes thereby. They would get cloth for
themselves as well as help the starving millions in the villages. For
God’s sake and for the sake of the starving poor of the country,
let them all, today and, if possible, at that very moment, take to

I believe Nimu<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2   </font></sup>is
not yet old enough to be bothered with the question of when she would
like to marry. I personally would wish that we wait for two years. If
Ramdas is willing to wait, I will insist on waiting. I am thinking of
Nimu’s interest only. After marriage she is sure to live with
Ramdas, and I shudder at the thought  of  her becoming pregnant,
which would be but a natural consequence. Nimu is by no means fit to
carry the burden of a child. I have agreed to this engagement out of
consideration for you and Ramdas. Had Ramdas not been agreeable, I
would have opposed your wish. I gather from Jamnadas that they were
on the point of selling off Nimu. I would not then have held myself
responsible for it. In the present case the responsibility lies on
your head and mine.</p>

Get Nimu engaged after telling her that I would like her to wait for
two years for the marriage. Whatever religious ceremony is necessary
for the engagement should be done at Amreli. If she wants the
marriage to be celebrated at Lakhtar I will not oppose it, but will
try to dissuade her. I shall take part in the marriage as a religious
rite only. Ramdas too is of the same opinion. If Ba objects, put her
at ease.</p>

The tour in Bihar commenced with my attending the Bihar Provincial
Conference at Purulia. The chief business of the Conference was to
pass a recommendatory resolution endorsing the proposed change in the
spinning franchise. The presidential speech was delivered in English.
I wish Moulvi Zubair had delivered it in Hindustani. I know that half
the audience did not understand this otherwise admirable speech.
There was, too, the Hindu Sabha and the next day the Khilafat
Conference in the same <i>pandal</i>. It was a most pleasing thing
for me to find all the presidents respecting my wish not to speak at
any of the conferences. I have grown weary of speaking. I have
nothing new to say. I travel because I fancy that the masses want to
meet me. I certainly want to meet them. I  deliver  my simple message

Annexed to the Conference was a well-arranged Industrial Exhibition.
You saw there the undoubted evolution of khaddar. There was the
spinning competition and the distribution of prizes. Osman of the
Khadi Pratishthan carried the first prize which consisted of a gold
medal. A little girl six years old was also a prize-winner. Her
spinning was not bad at all. She carried the prize in that she was
only six years and yet could steadily spin for the competition. The
lantern-slide lecture on khaddar, which Khitish Babu of the Khadi
Pratishthan delivered to an appreciative audience, was another
feature.</p>

the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund. There were collections, too,
on the spot both at men’s and women’s meetings. The collection at
the latter was as usual larger.</p>

I was taken too to a village called Golunda, a co-operative centre
where spinning is being tried. It is an interesting experiment and,

Purulia has an old Leper Asylum managed entirely by the London
Missionary Society. I saw the first Leper Asylum at Cuttack. But
there it was a hurried visit. I was able only to see the lepers and
the Superintendent. I had no time to see the appointments. At Purulia
I was able to see the quarters and understand the working of the
institution. In both the places the superintendents and their wives
have become devoted friends of the lepers. There was no unhappiness
on the faces of the inmates. They were able to forget their distress
through the loving care of their Superintendents. I was told at
Purulia that leprosy was brought under subjection by means of oil
injections, especially in the initial stages. The Superintendent also
told me that the cases that looked horrible—burnt-up skin or burnt
toes and fingers—were not contagious at all. In such cases the
disease had done its work. There was no contagion and no cure. The
contagious cases were those which neither the public nor the patient
recognized as such. These are the cases that admit of complete cure
through injections. It is a matter of humiliation for us that the
very necessary and humane work of looking after this portion of
distressed humanity should be taken up solely by Christian
foreigners. All honour to them, but what of us? The reader will be
sorry to learn that leprosy is on the increase. The general reason
assigned was unchaste living and wrong dieting.</p>

Unlike other parts of Bihar, Purulia and  the  surrounding country is
a predominantly Bengali-speaking tract. It has a comparatively better
and cooler climate than Calcutta. The Bengalis use Purulia as a
health resort. Deshbandhu’s father built a beautiful home in
Purulia. I was put up in this house. I felt sad having to be in
Deshbandhu’s house when he was no more. His father’s and his
mother’s <i>samadhis </i>were in this house. They lie in a corner.
A simple unpretentious stone platform marks the spot where their
ashes lie buried. Yonder was a dilapidated building which was built
by one of Deshbandhu’s sisters which she was conducting as a
Widows’ Home. With her premature death the Home died a natural
death. Yet another dilapidated building was pointed out to me as a
block of rooms which were built for housing poor people. The whole
surroundings seemed to be in keeping with the mystic charity of this
family of philanthropists. It was therefore a privilege for me to be
asked to</p>

Here there is evidently a confusion of thought, I know all about the
manufactured addresses by Untouchables during the visit of the Prince
of Wales. And whilst I know nothing about the British Government
being at the back of the movement referred to by the correspondent I
should not be at all surprised to find that the charge is well
founded. The tendency of the Government is undoubtedly to divide us.
Its strength lies in our divisions. Our unity will dissolve it. But
such a policy of the Government is no proof of its interference with
our work for untouchables. The Government, for instance, does not
directly or indirectly obstruct us in removing untouchability,
conducting schools for untouchables, digging wells for them or
sharing our own with them. Reform on the part of the Hindus is a
totally different thing from the exploitation of the untouchables.
Indeed, that exploitation is a certainty if we obstinately refuse to
do our duty and purge Hinduism of the curse. And we shall not be able
to exert ourselves to the utmost in this direction if we put the
blame on the shoulders of the Government and thus wait for the
removal of untouchability till swaraj is attained.</p>

killing the lion. In asking the other questions the correspondent has
betrayed his ignorance of non-violence and its working. Non-violence
is not so much a mental or intellectual attitude as a quality of the
heart, the soul. If Kennedy had no fear of the lion—fearlessness
being the first and indispensable condition of non-violence—if he
had a heart-recognition of the fact that the lion possessed a soul as
much as he himself did, instead of rushing to his rifle and relying
upon the problematical chance of the lion waiting till he reached his
rifle and of taking an unerring aim, he should have rushed to the
lion and put his arms round him in the fullest confidence of being
able to appeal to the soul within him and rescuing his child. That
such non-violence is reached by the fewest possible is only too true,
and therefore mankind in general will always kill lions and tigers in
order to save their children and cattle. But the fundamental position
remains unaffected. The phenomenon of real sadhus fearlessly meeting
and remaining unharmed without harming the wild beasts of the jungle
is not an unknown thing in Hindustan. We have a historical record of
such instances in the West also. The writer has further committed the
error of imagining an unimaginable case with brave men. If Kennedy
had remained a passive spectator of his child being devoured, the
case would have been one not of non-violence in any shape or form but
of rank and heartless cowardice, the very opposite of non-violence.</p>

The last question put by the correspondent is really what his letter
is intended to lead up to. In it the correspondent has shown woeful
ignorance of the history of our own times. He must know that the
movement for which I have made myself responsible is not an appeal of
the kind he imagines to the soul of the British lion, but it is an
appeal to the soul of India to find itself. It is a movement to
develop internal strength. In its final form, therefore, it is
undoubtedly an appeal to the soul of the British lion. But it then
becomes an appeal from an equal to an equal, not an appeal of a
beggar to a possible donor, or the vain appeal of a dwarf to a giant
to save him. It will then be an irresistible appeal of soul to soul.
In the process of development of internal strength, the inevitable
devouring will no doubt go on. But it will not cease even when and if
India rushes like Kennedy to the rifle. But whereas Kennedy tried to
reach the rifle which he possessed and whose use he knew, the Indian
Kennedy unlike the Californian would be trying to destroy the British
lion without possessing the necessary weapon or the skill to use it.
Under my method, there is the present possibility not of destroying
the British lion but of changing his nature. Again, under the Kennedy
method India will have to develop the same qualities which we at
present deplore in the British lion. Lastly, the third course which
evidently the correspondent imagines to be not merely possible but
the alternative to his method does not arise at all in the case of
India, as it did not in the Californian case. India to be free has
only two choices. She must either become, for the purpose of
achieving her freedom and to that extent only, non-violent, or must
endeavour to develop the Western methods of violence with all its
implications.</p>

I am supposed to be Chairman of the National  Arbitration Board
appointed at Delhi last year regarding communal disputes. I had wires
and letters seeking my intervention at Delhi, then at Panipat and now
at Allahabad. I was regretfully obliged to advise these parties that
I claimed no longer to exercise influence over the respective
communities. An arbitration is useful when the board of arbitration
has influence over the disputing parties and when they are ready to
abide by their award. Times have changed since the Delhi meeting.
Parties are just now better organized for quarrels than for
settlement.</p>

A correspondent from Madras has addressed to me a printed open letter
describing what are in his opinion the many misdeeds of the
Swarajists in Tamilnad and drawing my attention to the uses to which
my name has been put in connection with municipal elections. Here are
some samples:<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 2.52cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
If the foregoing is a correct picture, it is certainly deplorable.
The correspondent asks me to dissociate myself from such methods. His
suggestion either means that he does not know me, for I have more
than once expressed my strongest disapproval of untruth and violence
including rowdyism. I have even done penance more than once for an
illegitimate use of my name when there was even the remotest chance
of my position being misunderstood. It is impossible for me, however,
to hold myself responsible for the acts of those who will do evil
deeds in my name without the slightest warrant for it; or the
suggestion of the correspondent means that if what he has related is
true, I should cease to help the Swaraj Party. I cannot do it so long
as men like Pandit Motilalji guide its deliberations, and so long as
its creed remains what it is. My general help to the Swaraj Party
does not mean endorsement of every method adopted in the name of the
Party, or of the acts of individual Swarajists. I have no doubt that
there are loafers and humbugs in the Swaraj Party, but I am sorry to
have to confess that I have not yet belonged to a single democratic
institution which has been able to keep itself clear of such types of
humanity. The utmost that a man can do to keep himself clean is to
examine the creed of institutions and the general character of those
who run them, and to sever his connection when the creed itself
becomes questionable, or an institution though safe as to its creed
passes into</p>

the hands of men proved to be unscrupulous. If bad men have crept
into the Swaraj Party it can also claim many able, honest, self-
sacrificing and hard-working men. It will not suffer in comparison
with the other parties. The correspondent may rest assured that no
amount of encouragement from me of any party can possibly save it
from extinction if the adoption of methods such as he describes
becomes general. The question, therefore, for the correspondent, the
public and me is to find out how far the methods described are
adopted and countenanced by the Swaraj Party. My duty in this
direction is discharged by publishing the digest of such charges and
expressing my disapproval of crooked methods even for gaining a
laudable end. The probability is that the charges brought by the
correspondent will be refuted by those against whom they are
levelled.  I am chary of believing them because experience has taught
me that where party spirit runs high unfounded accusations are made
by opponents one against the other. Even my mahatmaship has not
rendered me immune from charges which I know to be untrue. Recently I
was charged whilst at Calcutta with prevarication and with gross
inconsistency. Many of the Punjab patriots during the Rowlatt Act
agitation were charged with wickednesses of which they were
absolutely innocent. I do not know a single public man who has not
been under the shadow of suspicion at some stage or other of his
public life. There is reason to be cautious, therefore, in believing
charges against parties or party leaders.</p>

For a long time I have purposely refrained from  writing anything in
these columns about Vaikom and its struggle against
unapproachability. Nor do I want as yet to say anything directly
bearing on it. But I do want to tell the reader how the satyagrahis
at Vaikom are passing their time.</p>

A letter was received at Calcutta from Vaikom dated the 1st of
August. It has remained unpublished through oversight. But the
substance of it is as fresh today as it was when it was received. I
reproduce it below:</p>

there are only ten volunteers including myself. One of us daily does
the kitchen work while others except one offer satyagraha for three
hours each. Including the time taken to go and return, the time for
satyagraha comes to four hours. We regularly get up at 4.30 a.m. and
prayer takes half an hour. From 5 to 6 we have sweeping, drawing
water and cleaning vessels. By seven</font></font></p>

of us except two (who go for satyagraha at 5.45 after bath) return
after bath and spin or card till it is time for going to the
barricade. Most of us regularly give 1,000 yards each per day and
some of us even more. The average output is over 10,000 yards per
day. I do not insist on our doing any work on Sundays when each does
according to his will. Some of us card and spin for two or three
hours on Sundays too. Anyhow no yarn is returned on Sundays. Those
who are Congress members spin for the Congress franchise on Sundays.
Some of us are now spinning on Sundays and other spare hours for our
humble gift towards All-India Deshbandhu Memorial Fund which you have
instituted. We wish to pack a small bundle of yarn to you on the 4th
September (G.O.M. Centenary Day). I hope you will be glad to receive
it. This we shall spin apart from our routine work. We mean either to
beg or to spin the whole of that auspicious day and to send whatever
is obtained. We have not yet settled what we should do.</font></font></p>

This shows that the satyagrahis of Vaikom have understood the spirit
of their work. There is no bluster, there is no fireworks display;
but there is here a simple determination to conquer by exact conduct.
A satyagrahi should be able to give a good account of every minute at
his disposal. This the Vaikom satyagrahis are doing.  The reader
cannot fail to notice the honesty in spinning Congress yarn, and the
yarn for the G.O.M. Centenary during their off-day. The idea too of
spinning for the All-India Deshbandhu Memorial is in keeping with the
rest of their doings. The letter before me gives me details of each
member’s spinning during the preceding week omitting Sunday. The
largest quantity spun by a single inmate in 6,895 yards of 17 counts.
The lowest is 2,936 yards of 18 counts. The remark against his name
is that he was absent on leave for three days. The average per man
per day during that week was 866.6 yards. I have also before me the
figures for the week ending 26th August. The highest during that week
was 7,700 for a single individual, and the lowest was 2,000, the
spinner having spun only two days during the week. The reader may ask
what connection is there between the removal of untouchability and
spinning. Apparently nothing. In reality much. It is not  any  single
isolated act which can be called satyagraha apart from the spirit
behind. Here, there is spirit behind the spinning which is bound to
tell in the long run; for spinning to these young men is a
sacrificial</p>

being used against the nation on due occasions. What, for instance,
could prevent a future Dyer from using these university men for
enacting another Jallianwala Bagh? May not young men themselves offer
their services for an expedition against the innocent Chinese, or the
equally innocent Tibetans when their subjection is felt necessary in
the interests of imperial commerce? Some of the young volunteers who
served during the War justified their action by saying that there- by
they gained experience in the art of war, just the reason which
consciously or unconsciously prompted some of the Frontier
expeditions. Those who run empires successfully have an instinctive
knowledge of human nature. It is not deliberately bad or wicked. It
acts excellently under a high impulse. And thousands of young men
who, before they join any corps, must take the oath of allegiance and
must on scores of occasions salute the Union Jack, will naturally
want to give a good account of their loyalty and willingly shoot down
their fellow men upon receiving from their superiors orders to fire.
Whilst, therefore, even as an out-and-out believer in ahimsa, I can
understand and appreciate military training for those who believe in
the necessity of the use of arms on given occasions, I am unable to
advocate the military training under the Government of the youth of
the country so long as it remains utterly irresponsive to the needs
of the people, and I should be against compulsory military training
in every case and even under a national government. Those who do not
wish to take military training should not be debarred from joining
public universities. Physical culture stands on a different basis
altogether. It can be and should be part of any sound educational
scheme even as many other subjects are.</p>

I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the figures or the description,
but both may be safely taken as generally correct. The writer of the
letter says that Deshbandhu had promised “to relieve them of their
sufferings,” and asks me to complete the work that death prevented
Deshbandhu from even beginning. He then suggests that I should find a

The writer is well-meaning but it is clear that he does not know that
the cinema will not make the men and women literate or wean them from
the vices he mentions. He does not know also that these labourers are
not likely to take to the looms or the spinning-wheels as a
supplementary occupation for they do not need it; they may learn
spinning and weaving to help them in hartals or when they are out of
employment. Moral and social reform among the labourers is most
difficult and taxing. It is slow work and can only be done at the
hands of reformers who will live practically in their midst and by
their sterling character affect the lives of the mill-hands for the
better. Such work requires no capital and whatever is required will
be gladly paid for by the mill-hands themselves as is actually
happening today in Ahmedabad and will presently happen in Jamshedpur.</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">During
my boyhood one of my paternal uncles told me a story which runs thus—
“Once there were two young men who were fast friends. They appeared
to have had two bodies but one soul. Their parents did not like it
and were on the look-out to effect enmity between these friends. They
proclaimed probably by a beat of drum a handsome reward to anyone
successfully effecting a breach between the friends. One old woman
popularly known as ‘Kutni’ undertook the task. She went to the
friends and called only one of them apart from the other but within
his (other friend’s) sight. She took her mouth to the ears of the
friend whom she had called apart, pretended to say something to him,
said nothing and went away. The man returned to his friend who was
left behind and was asked to state what the woman had told him. The
poor man stated that she had said nothing. Suspicion naturally arose
in the mind of the other man who saw so many performances with his
own eyes and was in the dark as to their purposes and result, and it
developed. In course of time their friendship came to an end and the
woman got the reward.”</font></font></p>

in the same way, Mahatmaji, please do not expect perfect unity
between the Hindus and Mussalmans so long as the third party, with
not only all the available resources of the country but also with
those of the whole British Empire and with a clear knowledge that its
very existence depends only on the disunion and quarrel among the
several races inhabiting this country, is always persistently trying
every moment to keep the people fighting among themselves. You are
too anxious for Hindu-Muslim unity as a road to swaraj but if you
please think of it over and over again, I am sure you will arrive at
a conclusion that the overthrow of this Government and establishment
of swaraj in this country are the road to peace and unity among the
several communities of the country and not the </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><i>vice

Your followers in Travancore were so much harassed by the Government
there at Vaikom. If you want that the untouchables be given certain
rights and privileges in a certain Hindu temple, there will be a
protest from the orthodox section of the Hindu community but is it
not a fact that this Government comes and will come to help them
against the untouchables? How can you succeed in this matter unless
and until you remove this Government? At present, Mahatmaji, for any
thing evil in this country this Government is alone responsible. You
are supported in this your programme by the majority of the Indian
people but it is not fulfilled only owing to the existence of this
Government.</font></font></p>
