	Shri Valji Desai’s translation has been revised by me, and I can
	assure the reader that the spirit of the original in Gujarati has
	been very faithfuly kept by the translator. The original chapters
	were all written by me from memory. They were written partly in the
	Yeravda jail and partly outside after my premature release. As the
	translator knew of this fact, he made a diligent study of the file
	of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>and wherever he discovered slips of
	memory, he has not hesitated to make the necessary corrections. The
	reader will share my pleasure that in no relevant or material
	paricular has there been any slip. I need hardly mention that those
	who are following the weekly chapters of <i>My </i><i>Experiments
	</i><i>with Truth </i>cannot afford to miss these chapters on
	satyagraha, if they would follow in all its  detail  the working out
	of the search after Truth.</p>

The satyagraha struggle of the  Indians in  South   Africa lasted
eight years. The term <i>satyagraha </i>was invented and employed in
connection  therewith.  I   had   long   entertained   a   desire  
to   write a history of that struggle myself. Some things only I
could write. Only the general who conducts a campaign can know the
objective of each particular move. And as this was the first attempt
to  apply  the  principle of satyagraha to  politics  on  a  large 
scale,   it   is necessary any day that the public should have an
idea of its development.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But today satyagraha has had ample scope in India. Here there has
been an inevitable series of struggles beginning with the rather
local question of the Viramgam customs.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
It was through the instrumentality of Bhai Motilal, the
public-spirited good tailor of Wadhvan, that I became interested in
the Viramgam question. I had just arrived from England and was
proceeding to Saurashtra in the year 1915. I was travelling third
class. At Wadhvan station Motilal came up to me with a small party.
He gave me some account of the hardships inflicted on the people  at
Viramgam, and said: “Please do something to end this trouble. It
will be doing an immense service to Saurashtra, the land of your
birth.” There was an expression of both compassion and firmness  in
 his  eyes.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.13cm">“Are
you ready to go to jail?” I asked.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 118%">
“We are ready to march to the gallows,” was the quick reply.
“Jail will do for me,” I said. “But see that you do not leave
me</p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 0.37cm">in the lurch.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.08cm">“That
only time can show,” said Motilal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 102%">
I reached Rajkot, obtained detailed information and commenced
correspondence with Government. In speeches at Bagasra and elsewhere,
I dropped a hint that the people should be ready to offer satyagraha
at Viramgam if necessary. The loyal C. I. D. brought these speeches
to the notice of Government. In this they served Government and,
unintentionally, served the people also. Finally, I had a talk with</p>

levied at Viramgam and elsewhere from persons entering British India
from Kathiawar, ostensibly to prevent smuggling of goods from foreign
countries. The customs cordon was abolished in November 1917; also,

Lord Chelmsford on the matter. He promised abolition of the customs
line and was as good as his word. I know others also tried for this.
But I am strongly of opinion that the imminent possibility of
satyagraha was the chief factor in obtaining the desired redress.</p>

Then came the Indian Emigration Act. Great efforts were put forth to
get indenture repealed. There was a considerable public agitation.
The Bombay meeting fixed May 31, 1917, as the date from which onwards
indentured labour should be stopped.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>This is not the place for narrating how that
particular date came to be selected. A deputation of ladies first
waited upon the Viceroy in connection with this. I cannot help
mentioning here the name of the high-souled sister, Mrs. Jaiji Petit.
It was she who may be said to have organized this deputation. Here,
too, success came merely through preparedness for satyagraha. But it
is important to remember the distinction that in this case public
agitation was also necessary. The stopping of indentured labour was
very much more important than the abolition of the Viramgam customs.
Lord Chelmsford committed a series of blunders beginning with the
passing of the Rowlatt Act<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
</font></sup>. Still, I think, he was a wise ruler. But what Viceroy
can escape for long the influence of the permanent officials of the
Civil Service?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
The third  in  order  came  the  Champaran  struggle<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
</font></sup>,  of  which Rajendra Babu has written a detailed
history. Here satyagraha had actually to be offered. Mere
preparedness for it did not suffice, as powerful vested interests
were arrayed in opposition. The peace maintained by the people of
Champaran deserves to be placed on record. I can bear witness to the
perfect non-violence of theleaders in thought, word and deed. Hence
it was that this age-long abuse came to an end in six months.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4</font></sup></p>

The fourth struggle was that of the mill-hands of Ahmedabad.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>Gujarat is perfectly familiar with its history. How
peaceful the labourers were! As for the leaders, there can hardly be
anything for me to say. Still I hold the victory in this case was not
quite pure, as the fast I had to observe in order to sustain the
labourers in their determination exercised indirect pressure upon the
mill-owners. The fast was bound to influence them, as I enjoyed
friendly relations with them. Still the moral of the fight is clear.
If the labourers carry on their struggle peacefully, they must
succeed and also win the hearts of their masters. They have not won
their masters’ hearts, as they were not innocent in thought, word
and deed. They were non-violent in deed, which is certainly to their
credit.</p>

The fifth was the Kheda struggle. I cannot say that in this case all
the local leaders of satyagraha parties adhered to the pure truth.
Peace was certainly maintained. The non-violence of the peasantry,
however, was only superficial, like that of the mill-hands. So we
came out of the struggle with bare honour. However, there was a great
awakening among the people. But Kheda had not fully grasped the
lesson of non-violence; the mill-hands had not understood the true
meaning of peace. The people had therefore to suffer. At the time of
the Rowlatt Act satyagraha, I had to confess my Himalayan blunder, to
fast myself and invite others to do so.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

The sixth was in connection with the Rowlatt Act. Therein our
inherent shortcomings came to the surface. But the original
foundation was well and truly laid. We admitted all our shortcomings
and did penance for them. The Rowlatt Act was a dead letter even when
it was promulgated, and that black act was finally even repealed.
This struggle taught us a great lesson.</p>

unshaken that if a single satyagrahi holds out to the end, victory is
absolutely certain.</p>

Africa. That is the beauty of satyagraha. It comes up to oneself; one
has not to go out in search of it. This is a virtue inherent in the
principle itself. A <i>dharma-yuddha, </i>in which there are no
secrets to be guarded, no scope for cunning and no place for untruth,
comes unsought; and a man of religion is ever ready for it. A
struggle which has to be previously planned is not a righteous
struggle. In 3 righteous struggle God Himself plans campaigns and
conducts battles. A <i>dharma-yuddha </i>can be waged only in the
name of God, and it is only when the satyagrahi feels quite helpless,
is apparently on his last legs and finds utter darkness all around
him, that God comes to the rescue. God helps when one feels oneself
humbler than the very dust under one’s feet. Only to the weak and
help. less is divine succour vouchsafed.</p>

The reader knows that, owing to my fast<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

history of satyagraha in South Africa. I take it up again with the
current issue. I hope I shall now be able to complete it without
impediments. From my reminiscences of that history I see that there
is nothing in our present position which I had not encountered in
South Africa on a smaller scale: in the beginning the same
enthusiasm, the same unity, the same persistence; in the middle the
same despondency, the same apathy, internecine strife, hatred, and so
on; a handful of people who, despite this, had unwavering faith,
determination, sacrifice, tolerance and who faced foreseen and
unforeseen difficulties of many kinds. The final phase of India’s
battle is yet to arrive. I expect the repetition here of the
experience I had of the final phase in South Africa. The reader will
from now on have an account of the last phase of the struggle in
South Africa. Therein he will see how help came unsought, how the
people’s enthusiasm rose spontaneously and how there was complete
victory for the Indians.</p>

Again, I am convinced that what happened in South Africa will also
happen here, because I have unswerving faith in the power of
self-sacrifice, truth and non-violence. I literally believe that
before one wedded to truth stands all the wealth of the world; such a
one feels the presence of God. I also literally believe that
non-violence cannot tolerate the presence of animosity in its
vicinity. I am a firm follower of the maxim: nothing is impossible
for those who are prepared to suffer. I see such self-sacrifice,
truth and non-violence in many workers. It has been my invariable
experience that such sacrifices would never go in vain.</p>

But some may contend that the complete victory in South Africa meant
only that the Indians maintained their <i>status quo</i>. Those who
say so are ignorant. Had the battle in South Africa not been fought,
today Indians would have been driven out not only  from  South
Africa,  but also  from  all  other  British  colonies  and   no

to be not a country but a continent, but considering area alone, four
or five Indias could be carved out of Africa. Africa is a peninsula
like India; South Africa is thus mainly surrounded by the sea. There
is a general impression that Africa is the hottest part of the earth,
and in a sense this is true. The equator passes through the middle of
Africa, and people in India cannot have any idea of the heat in
countries situated along this line. The heat which we feel in the
extreme south of India gives us some notion of it. But in South
Africa there is nothing of that kind, as it is far away from the
equator. The climate of many parts is so healthy and temperate that
Europeans can settle there in comfort, while it is nearly impossible
for them to settle in India. Moreover, there are in South Africa
lands of great elevation like Tibet or Kashmir, but these do not
attain a height of ten  to  fourteen thousand feet as in Tibet.

Johannesburg, the golden city of South Africa. Only fifty years ago,
the site on which it now stands was desolate and covered with dry
grass. But when gold mines were discovered, houses began to be built
one after another, as if by magic, and today there are many handsome
and substantial buildings. The wealthy people of the place have got
trees from the more fertile tracts of South Africa and from Europe,
paying as much as a guinea for a tree, and have planted them there. A

I do not propose to describe all the parts of South Africa, but will
confine myself only to those which are connected with our
subject-matter. One part of South Africa is under the Portuguese, and
the rest under the British. The territory under the Portuguese is
called Delagoa Bay, and this is the first South African port for
steamers from India. As we proceed further south, we come to Natal,
the first British Colony. Its chief seaport is called Port Natal, but
we know  it  as Durban, under which name it is generally known all
over South Africa. Durban is the largest city in Natal. The capital
is Pietermaritzburg, situated inland at a distance of about sixty
miles from Durban and at a height of about two thousand feet above
sea-level. The climate of Durban is somewhat like that of Bombay,
although rather colder. If we proceed further inland beyond Natal we
reach the Transvaal, whose mines supply the world with the largest
amount of gold. Some years ago diamond mines were also discovered, in
one of which was the world’s largest diamond. The Cullinan, so
called after the name of the proprietor of the mine, weighed over
3,000 carats, or over 1<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup><sub><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3
</font></sub>lb. avoirdupois, while the Kohinoor now weighs about 100
carats and the Orloff, one of the Russian crown jewels, about 200
carats.</p>

But though Johannesburg is the centre of the gold-mining industry and
has diamond mines in the neighbourhood, it is not the official
capital of the Transvaal. The capital is Pretoria, at a distance of
about thirty-six miles from Johannesburg. In Pretoria one chiefly 
finds officials and politicians and the population drawn by them. It
is therefore a comparatively quiet place, while Johannesburg is full
of bustle. As a visitor from a quiet village, or for the matter of
that from a small town in India, to Bombay, would be confounded with
the din and roar of the city, even so would a visitor from Pretoria
be affected by Johannesburg. It would be no exaggeration to say that
the citizens of Johannesburg do not walk but seem as if they ran. No
one has the</p>

leisure to look at anyone else, and everyone is apparently engrossed
in thinking of how to amass the maximum wealth in the  minimum
oftime! If leaving the Transvaal we travel further inland towards the
West, we come to Orange Free State or Orangia. Its capital is
Bloemfontein, a very quiet and small town. There are no mines in
Orangia like those in the Transvaal. A few hours’ railway journey
from here takes us to the boundary of the Cape Colony, the biggest of
all the South African colonies. Its capital, which is also its
largest seaport, is known as Cape Town and is situated on the Cape of
Good Hope, so called by King John of Portugal, as after its discovery
he hoped his people would be able to find a new and easier way of
reaching India, the supreme object of the maritime expeditions of
that age. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>Over
and above these four principal British colonies, there are several
territories under British ‘protection’, inhabited by races which
had migrated there before the appearance of Europeans on the scene.</p>

The chief industry of South Africa is agriculture and for this it is
pre-eminently fitted. Some parts of it are delightful and fertile.
The principal grain is maize, which is grown without much labour and
forms the staple food of the Negro inhabitants of South Africa. Wheat
also is grown in some parts. South Africa is famous for its fruits.
Natal cultivates many varieties of excellent bananas, pawpaws and
pineapples, and that too in such abundance that they are available to
the poorest of the poor. In Natal as well as in other colonies,
oranges, peaches and apricots grow in such plenty that thousands get
them in the country for the labour of gathering them. The Cape Colony
is the land of grapes and plums. Hardly any other place grows such
fine grapes, and during the season they can be had so cheap that even
a poor man can have his fill. It is impossible that there should be
no mangoes in places inhabited by Indians. Indians planted mango
trees in South Africa and consequently mangoes also are available in
considerable quantities. Some varieties of these can certainly
compete with the best mangoes of Bombay. Vegetables also are

The scenery of Durban is considered very beautiful, but that of Cape
Town surpasses it. Cape Town is situated at the foot of the Table
Mountain which is neither too high nor too low. A gifted lady who
dotes on South Africa says in her poem about this mountain that no
other gave her such a sense of the unique. There may be exaggeration
in this. I think there it. But one of her points struck me as true.
She says the Table Mountain stands in the position of a friend to the
citizens of Cape Town. Not being too high, it does not inspire awe.
People are not compelled to worship it from afar, but build their
houses upon it and live there. And as it is just on the seashore, the
sea always washes its foot with its clear waters. Young and old, men
and women, fearlessly move about the whole mountain, which resounds
every day with the voices of thousands. Its tall trees and flowers of
fine fragrance and variegated hues impart such a charm to the
mountain that one can never see too much of it, or move too much
about it.</p>

South Africa cannot boast of such mighty  rivers  as  the  Ganges or
the Indus. The few that are there are comparatively small. The water
of rivers cannot reach many places. No canals can be taken to the
highlands. And how can there be canals in the absence of large
rivers? Wherever there is a defeciency of surface water in south
Africa, artesian   wells   are   sunk,   and   water   needed    for 
  irrigating fields is pumped up by windmills and steamengines.
Agriculture receives much encouragement from Government. Government
sends out agricultural  experts   to   advise   the   cultivators,  
maintains model farms where experiments are carried on for their
benefit, provides them with good cattle and seed, bores artesian
wells for them at very little cost and permits them to repay this

As South Africa is to the south, and India to the north, of the
equator, climatic conditions there are just the reverse of what they

are not at all ancient. It has not been possible definitely to
ascertain who were the inhabitants of South Africa in remote times.
When the Europeans settled in South Africa, they found the Negroes
there. These Negroes are supposed to have been the descendants of
some of the slaves in America who managed to escape from their cruel 
bondage and migrated to Africa. They are divided into various tribes
such as the Zulus, the Swazis, the Basutos, the Bechuanas, etc. They
have a number of different languages. These Negroes must be regarded
as the original inhabitants of South Africa. But South Africa is such
a vast country that it can easily support twenty or thirty times its
present population of Negroes. The distance between Cape Town and
Durban is about eighteen hundred miles by rail; the distance by sea
also is not less than one thousand miles. The combined area of these
four colonies is 473,000 square miles. In 1914 the Negro population

Among the Negroes, the tallest and the most handsome are the Zulus. I
have deliberately used the epithet ‘handsome, in connection with
Negroes. A fair complexion and a pointed nose represent our ideal of
beauty. If we discard this superstition for a moment, we feel that
the Creator did not spare Himself in fashioning the Zulu to
perfection. Men and women are both tall and broad-chested in
proportion to their height. Their muscles are strong and well set.
The calves of the legs and the arms are muscular and always well
rounded. You will rarely find a man or woman walking with a stoop or
with a hump back. The lips are certainly large and thick, but as they
are in prefect symmetry with the entire physique, I for one would not
say that they are unshapely. The eyes are round and bright. The nose
is</p>

flat and  large,  such  as  becomes  a  large  face  and  the  curled
 hair on the head sets off to advantage the Zulu’s skin which is
black and shining like ebony. If we ask a Zulu to which of the
various races inhabiting South Africa he will award the palm for
beauty, he will unhesitatingly decide in favour of his own people,
and in this I would not see any want of judgment on his part. The
physique of the Zulu is powerfully built and finely shaped by nature
without any such effort as is made by Sandow and others in Europe in
order to develop the muscles. It is a law of nature that the skin of
races living near the equator should be black. And if we believe that
there must be beauty in everything fashioned by nature, we would not
only steer clear of all narrow and one-sided conceptions of beauty,
but we in India would be free from the improper sense of shame and
dislike which we feel for our own complexion. If it is anything but
fair.</p>

The Negroes live in round huts built of wattle and daub. The huts
have a single round wall and are thatched with hay. A pillar inside
supports the roof. A low entrance through which one can pass only by
bending oneself is the only aperture for the passage of air. The
entrance is rarely provided with a door. Like ourselves, the Negroes
plaster the walls and the floor with earth and animal dung. It is
said the Negroes cannot make anything square in shape. They have
trained their eyes to see and make only round things. We never find
nature drawing straight lines or rectilinear figures, and these
innocent children of nature derive all their knowledge from their
experience of her.</p>

The  furniture  in  the  hut is  in   keeping  with  the   simplicity
of the  place.  There  would  be  no  room  for  tables,  chairs, 
boxes and such other things, and even now these things are rarely
seen in a hut. Before the advent of European civilization, the
Negroes used to wear animal skins, which also served them as carpets,
bedsheets and quilts. Nowadays they use blankets. Before British
rule, men as well as women moved about almost in a state of nudity.
Even now many do the  same  in  the  country.  They  cover  the 
private  parts  with  a  piece of skin. Some dispense even with this.
But let not anyone infer from  this  that  these  people   cannot  
control   their   senses.   Where a  large  society  follows  a 
particular  custom,  it  is  quite possible  that the custom is
harmless even if it seems highly improper to the members of another
society. These Negroes have  no  time  to  be staring at one another.

women at all agitated or affected by a sense of shame. I do not think
there is anything supernatural in this  account.  If  in  India 
today,  there should be none who would be equally pure on a similar
occasion, that does not set a limit to our striving after purity, but
only argues our own degradation. It is only vanity which makes us
look upon the Negroes as savages. They are not the barbarians we
imagine them to be.</p>

The law requires Negro women to cover themselves from the chest to
the knees when they go to a town. They are thus obliged to wrap a
piece of cloth round their body. Consequently pieces of that size
command a large sale in South Africa, and thousands of such blankets
or sheets are imported from Europe every year. The men are similarly
required to cover themselves from the waist to the knees. Many,
therefore, have taken to the practice of wearing second-hand clothing
from Europe. Others wear a sort of knickers with a fastening tape.
All these clothes are imported from Europe.</p>

The staple food of the Negroes is maize, and meat when available.
Fortunately, they know nothing about spices or condiments. If they
find spices in their food, or even if it is coloured by turmeric,
they turn up their noses at it, and those among them who are looked
upon as quite uncivilized will not so much as touch it. It is no
uncommon thing for a Zulu to take at a time one pound of boiled maize
with a little salt. He is quite content to live upon porridge made
from crushed mealies boiled in water. Whenever he can get meat, he
eats it raw or cooked, boiled or roasted, with only salt. He does not
mind taking the flesh of any animal.</p>

The Negro languages are named after the various tribes. The art of
writing was recently introduced by the Europeans. There is nothing
like a Negro alphabet. The Bible and other books have now been
printed in the Negro languages in Roman characters. The Zulu language
is very sweet. Most words end with the sound of broad ‘a’ so the
language sounds soft and pleasing to the ear. I have heard and read
that there is both meaning and poetry in the words. Judging from the
few words which I happened to pick up, I think this statement is
just. There are for most of the places sweet and poetical Negro names
whose European equivalents I have mentioned. I am sorry I do not
remember them and so cannot present them here to the reader.</p>

religion in a wide sense, we can say that the Negroes do believe in
and worship a supreme Being beyond human comprehension. They fear
this power too. They are dimly conscious of the fact that the
dissolution of the body does not mean the utter annihilation of a
person. If we acknowledge morality as the basis of religion, the
Negroes being moral may be held even to be religious. They have a
perfect grasp of the distinction between truth and falsehood. It is
doubtful whether Europeans or ourselves practise truthfulness to the
same extent as the Negroes in their primitive state do. They have no
temples or anything else of that kind. There are many superstitions
among them as among other races.</p>

The reader will be surprised to learn that this race, which is second
to none in the world in point of physical strength, is so timid that
a Negro is afraid at the sight even of a European child. If  someone
aims a revolver at him, he will either flee or will be too stupefied
to have the power even to move. There is certainly reason for this.
The notion is firmly impressed on the Negro mind that it is only by
some magic that a handful of Europeans have been able to subdue such
a numerous and savage race as themselves. The Negro was well
acquainted with the use of the spear, and the bow and arrows. Of
these he has been deprived. He had never seen, never fired, a gun. No
match is needed, nothing more has to be done beyond moving a finger
and yet a small tube all at once emits a sound, a flash is seen, and
a bullet wounds and causes the death of a person in an instant. This
is something the Negro cannot understand. So  he  stands  in mortal
terror of those who wield such a weapon. He and  his forefathers
before him have seen that such bullets have taken the livesof many
helpless and innocent Negroes. Many do not know even now how this
happens.</p>

commits all manner of crimes. That civilization must lead to the
multiplication of wants is as certain as that two and two  make 
four. In order to increase the Negro’s wants or to teach him the
value of labour, a poll-tax and a hut tax have been imposed upon him.
If these imposts were not levied, this race of agriculturists living
on their farms would not enter mines hundreds of feet deep in order
to extract gold or diamonds, and if their labour were not available
for the mines, gold as well as diamonds would remain in the bowels of
the earth. Likewise, the Europeans would find it difficult to get any
servant, if no such tax was imposed. The result has been that
thousands of Negro miners suffer, along with other diseases, from a
kind of phthisis called “miners’ phthisis”. This is a fatal
disease. Hardly any of those who fall into its clutches recover. The
reader can easily imagine what self-restraint thousands of men living
in mines away from their families can possibly exercise. They
consequently fall easy victims to venereal disease. Not that
thoughtful Europeans of South Africa are not alive to this serious
question. Some of them definitely hold it can hardly be claimed that

About four hundred years ago the Dutch founded a settlement in this
great country, then inhabited by such a simple and unsophisticated
race. They kept slaves. Some Dutchmen from Java with their Malay
slaves entered the country which we now know as Cape Colony. These
Malays are Mussalmans. They have Dutch blood in their veins and
inherit some of the qualities of the Dutch. They are found scattered
throughout South Africa, but Cape Town is their stronghold. Some of
them today are in the service of Europeans, while others follow
independent avocations. Malay women are very industrious and
intelligent. They are generally cleanly in their ways of living. They
are experts in laundry work and sewing. The men carry on some petty
trade. Many drive hackney carriages. Some have received higher
English education. One of them is the well known Doctor Abdul Rahman
of Cape Town. He was a member of the old Colonial legislature at Cape
Town. Under the new constitution this right of entering the
Parliament has been taken away.</p>

them was highly suited for agriculture. They also saw  that  the
‘natives’  easily  maintained  themselves  by  working  for  only
 a short time during the year. Why should they not force these people
to labour for them? The Dutch had guns. They were clever strategists.
They knew how to tame human beings like other animals and they
believed that their religion did not object to their doing so. In
this way they commenced agriculture with the labour of the South
African ‘natives’ with not a single doubt as to the morality of
their action.</p>

As the Dutch were in search of good lands for their own expansion, so
were the English who also gradually arrived on the scene. The English
and the Dutch were of course cousins. Their characters and ambitions
were similar. Pots from the same pottery are often likely to clash
against each other. So these two nations, while gradually advancing
their respective interests and subduing the Negroes, came into
collision. There were disputes and then battles between them. The
English suffered a defeat at Majuba Hill. Majuba left a soreness
which assumed a serious form and came to a head in the Boer War which
lasted from 1899 to 1902. And when General Cronje surrendered, Lord
Roberts was able to cable to Queen Victoria that Majuba had been
avenged. But  when  this  first  collision occurred between the two
nations previous to the Boer War,  many  of the Dutch were unwilling
to remain under even the nominal authority of the British and
‘trekked’ into the unknown interior of South Africa. This was the
genesis of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State.</p>

These Dutch came to be known in South Africa as Boers. They have
preserved their language by clinging to it as a child clings to its
mother. They have an intense realization of the close relation
between their language and their liberty. In spite of many attacks,
they have preserved their mother tongue intact. The language assumed
a new form suited to their genius. As they could not maintain very
close relations with Holland, they began to speak a patois derived
from the Dutch as the Prakrits are derived from Sanskrit. And not
wishing to impose an unnecessary burden upon their children, they
have given a permanent shape to this patois. It is called Taal. Their
books are written in Taal, their children are educated through it,
and Boer members of the Union Parliament make it a point to deliver
their speeches in it. Since the formation of the Union, Taal or Dutch
and English have been officially treated on a footing of equality</p>

throughout South Africa, so much so that the Government Gaze-ttes and
records of Parliament must be in both languages. The Boers are
simple, frank and religious. They settle in the midst  of  extensive
farms. We can have no idea of the extent of these farms. A farm with
us means generally an acre or two, and sometimes even less. In South
Africa a single farmer has hundreds or thousands of acres of land in
his possession. He is not anxious to put all this under cultivation
at once, and if anyone argues with him, he will say, ‘let it lie
fallow. Lands which now lie fallow will be cultivated by our
children.’</p>

Every Boer is a good fighter. However much the Boers may quarrel
among themselves, their liberty is so dear to them that when it is in
danger, all get ready and fight as one man. They do not need
elaborate drilling, for fighting is a characteristic of the whole
nation. General Smuts, General De Wet, and General Hertzog are all of
them great lawyers, great farmers and equally great soldiers. General
Botha had one farm of nine thousand acres. He was familiar with all
the intricacies of agriculture. When he went to Europe in connection
with negotiations for peace, it was said of him that there was hardly
anyone in Europe who was as good a judge of sheep as he was. General
Botha had succeeded the late President Kruger. His knowledge of
English was excellent; yet when he met the King and ministers in
England, he always preferred to talk in his own mother tongue. Who
can say that this was not the proper thing to do? Why should he run
the risk of committing a mistake in order to display his knowledge of
English? Why should he allow his train of thought to be disturbed in
the search for the right word? The British ministers might quite
unintentionally employ some unfamiliar English idiom, he might not
understand what they meant, be led into giving the wrong reply and
get confused; and thus his cause would suffer. Why should he commit
such a serious blunder?</p>

Boer women are as brave and simple as the men. If the Boers shed
their blood in the Boer War, they were able to offer this sacrifice
owing to the courage of their womenfolk and the inspiration they
received from them. The women were not afraid of widowhood and
refused to waste a thought upon the future. I have stated above that
the Boers are religious-minded Christians. But it cannot be said that
they believe in the New Testament. As a matter of fact Europe does
not believe in it; in Europe, however, they do claim to respect it,
although only a few know and observe Christ’s religion of peace.

Boer women understood that their religion required them to suffer in

unturned in order to break their spirit. He confined them in separate

any sort of peace to continuing the war in that fashion, and asking

When this cry of anguish reached England, the English people were
deeply pained. They were full of admiration for the bravery of the
Boers. The fact that such a small nationality should sustain a
conflict with their world-wide empire was rankling in their minds.
But when the cry of agony raised by the women in the concentration
camps reached England not through themselves, not through their
men,—they were fighting valiantly on the battlefield,—but through
a few high-souled Englishmen and women who were then in South Africa,
the English people began to relent. The late Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman read the mind of the English nation and raised his
voice against the war. The late Mr. Stead publicly prayed and invited
others to pray that God might decree the English a defeat in the war.

knows about this peace, there are a few facts connectedwith it which
perhaps are not within the knowledge of many. The Union did not
immediately follow the peace, but each colony had its own
legislature. The ministry was not fully responsible to the
legislature. The Transvaal and the Free State were governed on Crown
Colony lines. Generals Botha and Smuts were not the men to be
satisfied with such restricted freedom. They kept aloof from the
Legislative Council. They non-co-operated. They flatly refused to
have anything to do with the Government. Lord Milner made a pungent
speech, in the course of which he said that General Botha need not
have attached so much importance to himself. The country’s
Government could well be carried on without him. Lord Milner thus
decided to stage <i>Hamlet </i>without the Prince of Denmark.</p>

I have written in unstinted praise of the bravery, the love of
liberty and the self-sacrifice of the Boers. But I did not intend to
convey the impression that there were no differences of opinion among
them during their days of trial, or that there were no weak-kneed
persons among them. Lord Milner succeeded in setting up a party among
the Boers who were easy to satisfy, and persuaded himself to believe
that he could make a success of the legislature with their
assistance. Even a stage play cannot be managed without the hero; and
an administrator in this matter-of-fact world who ignores the central
figure in the situation he has to deal with and still expects to
succeed can only be described as insane. Such indeed was the case of
Lord Milner. It was said that though he indulged in bluff, he found
it so difficult to govern the Transvaal and the Free State without
the assistance of General Botha, that he was often seen in his garden
in an anxious and excited state of mind. General Botha distinctly
stated that by the Treaty of Vereeniging, as he understood it, the
Boers were immediately entitled to complete internal autonomy. He
added that, had that not been the case, he would never have signed
the treaty. Lord Kitchener declared in reply that he had given no
such pledge to General Botha. The Boers, he said, would be gradually
granted full self-government as they proved their loyalty! Now who
was to judge between these two? How could one expect General Botha to
agree if arbitration was suggested? The decision arrived at in the
matter by the Imperial Government of the time was very creditable to
them. They conceded that the stronger party should accept the
interpretation of the agreement put upon it by the other and weaker
party. According to the principles of justice and truth, that is the
correct canon of</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
interpretation. I may have meant to say anything, but I must concede
that my speech or writing was intended to convey the meaning ascribed
to it by my hearer or reader in so far as he is concerned. We often
break this golden rule in our lives. Hence arise many of our
disputes, and half-truth, which is worse than untruth, is made to do
duty for truth.</p>

Thus when truth—in the present case General Botha—fully
triumphed, he set to work. All the colonies were eventually united,
and South Africa obtained full self-government. Its flag is the Union
Jack, it is shown in red on maps, and yet it is no exaggeration to
say that South Africa is completely independent. The British Empire
cannot receive a single farthing from South Africa without the
consent of its Government. Not only that, but British ministers have
conceded that if South Africa wishes to remove the Union Jack and to
be independent even in name, there is nothing to prevent it from
doing so. And if the Boers have so far not taken this step, there are
strong reasons for it. For one thing, the Boer leaders are shrewd and
sagacious men. They see nothing improper in maintaining with the
British Empire a partnership in which they have nothing to lose. But
there is another practical reason. In Natal the English preponderate,
in Cape Colony there is a large population of Englishmen though they
do not outnumber the Boers; in Johannesburg the English element is
predominant. This being the case, if the Boers seek to establish an
independent republic in South Africa, the result would be internecine
strife and possibly a civil war. South Africa, therefore, continues
to rank as a dominion of the British Empire.</p>

The way in which the Constitution of the Union was framed is worthy
of note. A National Convention, composed of delegates represenative
of all parties appointed by the Colonial legislatures, unanimously
prepared a draft Constitution and the British Parliament had to
approve it in its entirety. A member of the House of Commons drew the
attention of the House to a grammatical mistake and  suggested that
it should be rectified. The late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, while
rejecting the suggestion, observed that faultless grammar was not
essential to carrying on a government, that the Constitution was
framed as a result of negotiations between the British Cabinet and

There is one more circumstance worthy of notice in this connection.
There are some provisions in the Act of Union which may appear
meaningless to the lay reader. They have led  to  a  great increase
in expenditure. This had not escaped the notice  of the  framers of
the Constitution; but their object was not to attain perfection, but
by compromise to arrive at an understanding and to make the
Constitution a success. That is why the Union has four capitals, no
colony being prepared to part with its own capital. Similarly,
although the old colonial legislatures were abolished, provincial
councils with subordinate and delegated functions were set up. And
though governorships were abolished, officers corresponding to the
rank of Governor and styled Provincial Administrators were appointed.
Everyone knows that four local legislatures, four capitals and four
Governors are unnecessary and serve for mere show. But the shrewd
statesmen of South Africa did not object. The arrangement is showy
and entails additional expenditure, but union was desirable and
therefore the statesmen did what they thought fit, regardless of
outside criticism and got their policy approved by the British
Parliament.</p>

We saw in the preceding chapter how the English arrived. They settled
in Natal, where they obtained some concessions from  the  Zulus. They
observed that excellent sugarcane, tea and coffee could be grown in
Natal. Thousands of labourers would be needed in order to grow such
crops on a large scale, which was clearly beyond the capacity of a
handful of colonists. They offered inducements and then threats to
the Negroes in order to make them work but in vain, as slavery had
been then abolished. The Negro is not used to hard work. He can
easily maintain himself by working for six months in the year. Why
then should he bind himself to an employer for a long term? The
English settlers could make no progress at all with their plantations
in the absence of a stable labour force. They therefore</p>

opened negotiations with the Government of India and requestedtheir
help for the supply of labour. That Government complied with their
request, and the first batch of indentured labourers from India
reached Natal on November 16, 1860, truly a fateful date for this
history; had it not been for this, there would have been no Indians
and therefore no satyagraha in South Africa, and this book would have

In my opinion, the Government of India were not well advised in
taking the action they did. The British officials in India
consciously or unconsciously were partial to their brethren in Natal.
It is true that as many terms as possible, purporting to safeguard
the labourers’ interests, were entered in the indentures. Fairly
good arrangements were made for their board. But adequate
consideration was not given to the question as to how these
illiterate labourers who had gone to a distant land were to seek
redress if they had any grievances.  No thought was given to their
religious needs or to the preservation of their morality. The British
officials in India did not consider that although slavery had been
abolished by law, employers could not be free from a desire to make
slaves of their employees. They did not realize, as they ought to
have realized, that the labourers who had gone to Natal would in fact
become temporary slaves. The late Sir W.</p>

W. Hunter, who had deeply studied these labour conditions, used a
remarkable phrase about them. Writing about the Indian labourers in
Natal, he said that theirs was a state of semi-slavery. On another
occasion, in the course of a letter, he described their condition as
bordering on slavery. And tendering evidence before a commission in
Natal, the most prominent European in that Colony, the late Mr. Harry
Escombe, admitted as much. Testimony to the same effect can be
readily gathered from the statements of leading Europeans in Natal.
Most of these were incorporated in the memorials on the subject
submitted to the Government of India. But the fates would have their
course. And the steamer which carried those labourers to Natal
carried with them the seed of the great satyagraha movement.</p>

When the news that indentured labourers had gone to Natal reached
Mauritius, Indian traders having connection with such labourers were
induced to follow them there. Thousands of Indians, labourers as well
as traders, have settled in Mauritius, which is on the way to Natal
from India. An Indian trader in Mauritius, the late Sheth Abubakar
Amad, thought of opening a shop in Natal. The English in Natal had
then no idea of what Indian traders were capable of, nor did they
care. They had been able to raise very profitable crops of sugarcane,
tea and coffee, with the assistance of indentured labour. They
manufactured sugar, and in a surprisingly short time supplied South
Africa with a modest quantity of sugar, tea and coffee. They made so
much money that they built palatial mansions for themselves and
turned a wilderness into a veritable garden. In such circumstances,
they naturally did not mind an honest and plucky trader like 
Abubakar Sheth settling in their midst. Add to this that an
Englishman actually joined him as partner. Abubakar Sheth carried on
trade and purchased land, and the story of his prosperity reached
Porbandar, his native place, and the country around. Other Memans
consequently reached Natal. Bohras from Surat followed them. These 
traders  needed accountants, and Hindu accountants from Gujarat and
Saurashtra accompanied them</p>

Two classes of Indians thus settled in Natal, first, free traders and
their free servants, and second, indentured labourers. In course of
time the indentured labourers had children. Although not bound to
labour, these children were affected by several stringent provisions
of the colonial law. How can the children of slaves escape the brand
of slavery? The labourers went to Natal under indenture for a period
of five years. They were under no obligation to labour after the
expiry of that period, and were entitled to work as free labourers or
trade in Natal, and settle there if they wished. Some elected to do
so while others returned home. Those who remained in Natal came  to 
be known as ‘Free Indians’. It is necessary to understand the
peculiar position of this class. They were not admitted to all the
rights enjoyed by the entirely free Indians of whom I have first
spoken. For instance, they were required to obtain a pass if they
wanted to go from one</p>

The Indian traders saw that they could trade not only with indentured
labourers and ‘Free Indians’ but with the Negroes as well. Indian
merchants were a source of great convenience to the Negroes, who very
much feared the European traders. The European trader wanted to trade
with the Negro, but it would be too much for Negro customers to
expect courtesy at his hands. They might think it a great good
fortune if he gave them full consideration for their money. Some of
them had bitter experiences. A man might  purchase  an  article worth
four shillings, place a sovereign on the counter, and receive four
shillings as balance instead of sixteen, and sometimes even nothing
whatever! If the poor Negro asked for the balance or showed how the
amount paid him was less than his due, the reply would be gross
abuse. He might thank his stars if things stopped there; otherwise
the abuse would be reinforced by a blow or a kick. I do not mean to
suggest that all English traders behaved like this. But it can safely
be asserted that the number of such cases was fairly large. On the
other hand, Indian traders had a good word for the Negroes and even
joked with them. The simple Negro would like to enter the shop and
handle and examine the goods he wanted to purchase. Indian traders
permitted all this. It is true that in this they were not actuated by
altruistic motives; it may have had something to do with their
self-interest. The Indian might not miss the opportunity, if it
offered, of cheating his Negro customer, but his courtesy made him
popular with the Negroes. Moreover, the Negro never feared the Indian
 traders. On the other hand, cases have occurred in which an Indian
tried to cheat Negroes, but on being detected, was roughly handled by
them. And more often Negro customers have been heard to abuse Indian
traders. Thus, so far as Indians and Negroes were concerned, it is
the former who feared the latter. The result was that trade with
Negroes proved very profitable to Indian traders. And the Negroes
were to be found throughout South Africa.</p>

There were Boer republics in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State
during the eighties of the last century. I need scarcely say that in
these republics the Negro had no power, it was all a white men’s
affair. Indian traders had heard that they could also trade with the
Boers, who, being simple, frank and unassuming, would not think it
below their dignity to deal with Indian traders. Several Indian
traders therefore proceeded to the Transvaal and the Free State and
opened shops there. As there were no railways there at the time, they
earned</p>

large profits. The expectations of the Indian traders were fulfilled
and they carried on considerable trade with the Boers and the Negroes
as customers. Similarly, several Indian traders went to the Cape
Colony and began to earn fairly well. The Indians were thus
distributed in small numbers in all the four colonies.</p>

not afford to have labourers who, after serving their term, would be
free to compete with them to however small an extent. No doubt the
indentured labourers had gone to Natal, as they had not been very
successful in agriculture or other pursuits in India. But it is not
to be supposed that they had no knowledge of agriculture or that they
did not understand the value of land. They found that, if they grew
only vegetables in Natal, they could earn good incomes, and that
their earnings would be still better if they owned a small piece of
land. Many, therefore, on the termination of their indentures, began
to pursue some trade or other on a small scale. This was, on the
whole, advantageous to the settlers in Natal. Various kinds of
vegetables, which had not been grown before for want of a competent
class of cultivators, now became available. Other kinds, which had
been grown in small quantities, could now be had in abundance. The
result was a fall in the prices of vegetables. But the European
planters did not relish this new development. They felt they now had
competitors in a field in which they believed  they  had  a 
monopoly.  A  movement was, therefore, set  on  foot  against  these 
poor  time-expired labourers. The reader will be surprised to learn
that, while on the one hand the Europeans demanded more and more
labourers and easily took in as many of them as went from India, on
the other hand they started an agitation to harass ex-indentured
labourers in a variety of ways. This was the reward for their skill
and hard toil!</p>

demanded that the labourers who completed their indentures should be
sent back to India, and that, therefore, fresh labourers arriving in
Natal from that time forward should have a new clause entered in
their indentures, providing for their compulsory return to India at
the expiration of their term of service unless they renewed their
indentures. A second set advocated the imposition of a heavy annual
capitation tax on the labourers who did not re-indenture themselves
at the end of the first period of five years. Both, however, had the
same object in view, namely, by hook or by crook to make it
impossible for exindentured labourers to live as free men in Natal in
any circumstances. This agitation attained such serious dimensions,
that the Government of Natal appointed a commission<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. As the demands of both these classes of agitators were
quite unfair, and as the presence of the ex-indentured labourers was
clearly beneficial to the entire population from an economic
standpoint, the independent evidence recorded by the commission was
against the agitators, who thus failed to achieve any tangible result
for the time being. But as fire, although extinguished, leaves a
trail behind it, the agitation created some impression on the
Government of Natal. How could it be otherwise? The Government of
Natal was friendly to the planters. It therefore communicated with
the Government of India and laid before it the proposals of both the
sets of agitators. But the Government of India could not all at once
accept proposals which would reduce indentured labourers to perpetual
slavery. One justification or excuse for sending labourers to such a
far-off land under indenture  was  that  the labourers, after
completing the indentures, would become free to develop their powers
fully and consequently improve their economic condition. As Natal
then was still a Crown Colony, the Colonial Office was fully
responsible for its government. Natal, therefore, could not look for
help from that quarter either in satisfying its unjust demands. For
this and similar reasons a movement was set on foot to
attainresponsible government, which was eventually conferred  on
Natal in 1893. Natal now began to feel its strength. The Colonial
Office too did not any longer find it difficult to accept whatever
demands Natal might choose to make. Delegates from the new
responsible Government of Natal came to India to confer with the
Government of India. They proposed the  imposition  of  an   annual</p>

poll-tax of twenty-five pounds, or three hundred and seventy-five
rupees, on every Indian who had been freed from indenture. It was
evident that no Indian labourer could pay such an exorbitant tax and
live in Natal as a free man. Lord Elgin, the Governor-General of
India, considered that the amount was excessive, and ultimately he
accepted an annual poll-tax of three pounds. This was equivalent to
nearly six months’ earnings on the indenture scale. The tax was
levied, not only on the labourer himself, but also upon his wife, his
daughters aged thirteen years or upwards, and his sons aged sixteen
years or upwards. There was hardly any labourer who had not a wife
and a couple of children. Thus, as a general rule, every labourer was
required to pay an annual tax of twelve pounds. It is impossible to
describe the hardships that this tax entailed. Only those who
actually underwent the hardships could realize them, and only those
who witnessed their sufferings could have some idea of them. The
Indians carried on a powerful agitation against this action of the
Government of Natal. Memorials were submitted to the Imperial
Government and the Government of India, but to no purpose except for
a reduction in the amount of the tax. What could the poor labourers
do or understand in this matter? The agitation on their behalf was
carried on by the Indian traders, actuated by motives of patriotism
or of philanthropy.</p>

Free Indians fared no better. The European traders of Natal carried
on a similar agitation against them for mainly the  same  reasons.
Indian traders were well established. They acquired lands in good
localities. As the number of freed labourers began to increase, 
there was  a  larger   and   larger   demand   for   the   class  of
goods required by  them.  Bags  of rice  were  imported  from  India 
in  their  thousands  and  sold  at  a   good  profit.   Naturally
this trade was largely in the hands of Indians who had, besides,  a 
fair share of the trade with  Zulus.  They  thus  became  an 
eye-sore to  petty  European  traders.  Again,  some  Englishmen
pointed  out  to the Indian traders  that  according  to  law  they
were  entitled  to vote in the elections for the Legislative Assembly
of Natal and to stand as candidates for the same. Some Indians
therefore got their names entered on the electoral roll. This made
the  European politicians of Natal join the ranks of anti-Indians.
They doubted whether the Europeans could stand in competition with
Indians if the Indians’ prestige increased, and if their position
was consolidated in Natal. The first step, therefore, taken by the
responsible Government of Natal in connection with free Indians was
that they decided to enact</p>

how great was this victory for Indians. The Natal Government,
therefore, brought forward another bill, removing racial distinction
but indirectly disqualifying Indians. Indians protested against this
as well but without success. This new bill was ambiguous in meaning.
Indians were in a position to carry it finally to the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council with a view to its interpretation; but
they did not think it advisable to do so. I still think that they did
the right thing in avoiding this endless litigation. It was no small
thing that the colour bar was not allowed to be set up.</p>

there. To nip the  political  power  of   Indians   in   the   bud

10,000 free Indians.<sup class="footnote">1</sup>The
Europeans had no solid grounds for their apprehensions, but it is
impossible to convince by argument men who have been seized with
vague terrors. As they were ignorant of the helpless condition of
India and of the manners and customs of the Indian people, they were
under the impression that the Indians were as adventurous and
resourceful as themselves. They could scarcely be blamed if they thus
created a bugbear of the vast population of India in comparison with
their own small numbers. However that may be, the result of the
successful opposition to the disfranchising bill was that in two
other laws passed by the Natal Legislature it had to avoid racial
distinction and to attain its end in an indirect manner. The
position, therefore, was not as bad as it might have been. On this
occasion too Indians offered a strenuous resistance, but in spite of
this two laws were enacted.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>One
of these imposed severe restrictions on Indian trade and the other on
Indian immigration in Natal. The substance of the first Act was that
no one could trade without a licence issued by an official appointed
in accordance with its provisions. In practice any European could get
a licence while the Indian had to face no end of difficulty in the
matter. He had to engage a lawyer and incur other expenditure. Those
who could not afford it had to go without a Licence. The chief
provision of the other Act was that only such immigrants as were able
to pass the education test in a European language could enter the
Colony. This closed the doors of Natal against crores of Indians.
Lest I should inadvertently do the Government of Natal an injustice,
I must state that the Act further provided that an Indian resident in
Natal for three years before the passing of that Act might obtain a
certificate of domicile enabling him to leave the Colony and return
at any time with his wife and minor children without being required
to pass the education test.</p>

As in Natal, so in the other colonies anti-Indian prejudice had more
or less begun to grow even before 1880. Except in the Cape Colony,
the general opinion held was that as labourers the Indians were all
right, but it had become an axiom with many Europeans that the
immigration of free Indians was purely a disadvantage to South
Africa. The Transvaal was a republic. For Indians to declare their
British citizenship before its President was only to invite ridicule.
If they had any grievance, all they could do was to bring it to the
notice of the British Agent at Pretoria. Still the wonder is that
when the Transvaal came under the British flag, there was none from
whom Indians could expect even such assistance as the Agent rendered
when the Transvaal was independent. When during Lord Morley’s
tenure of the office of the Secretary of State for India, a
deputation on behalf of the Indians waited upon him, he  declared  in
 so  many  words  that, as the members of the deputation were aware,
the Imperial Government could exercise but little control over
self-governing dominions.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  
</font></sup>They could not dictate to them; they could plead, they
could argue, they could press for the application of their
principles. Indeed, in some instances they could more effectively
remonstrate with foreign Powers, as they remonstrated with the Boer
Republic, than with  their  own  people  in  the  colonies.  The 
relations  of   the mother country with the colonies were in the
nature of a silken tie which  would  snap  with  the  slightest  
tension.   As   force   was out of  the  question,  he  assured  the 
deputation  that  he  would   do   all he could by  negotiations. 
When  war  was  declared  on  the  Transvaal, Lord Lansdowne, Lord
Selborne and  other  British statesmen declared that the scandalous
treatment accorded to  theIndians by the South African Republic was
one of the causes of the war.</p>

Let us now see what sort of treatment this was. Indians first entered
the Transvaal in 1881. The late Sheth Abubakar opened a shop in
Pretoria and purchased land in one of its principal streets. Other
traders followed in his wake. Their great success excited the
jealousy of European traders who commenced an  anti-Indian campaign
in the newspapers, and submitted petitions to the Volksraad or
Parliament, praying that Indians should be expelled and their trade
stopped. The Europeans in this newly opened-up country had a
boundless hunger for riches. They were almost strangers to the 
dictates of morality. Here are some statements they made in their
petitions: “These Indians have no sense of human decency. They
suffer from loathsome diseases. They consider every woman as their
prey. They believe that women have no souls.” These four sentences
contain four lies. It would be easy to multiply such specimens. As
were the Europeans, so were their representatives. Little did the
Indian traders know what a sinister and unjust movement was being
carried on against them. They did not read newspapers. The newspaper
campaign and the petitions had the desired effect, and a bill was
introduced in the Volksraad. The leading Indians were taken aback
when they came to know how events had shaped themselves. They went to
see President Kruger who did not so much as admit them into his house
but made them stand in the courtyard. After hearing them for a while,
he said, “You are the descendants of Ishmael and therefore from
your very birth bound to slave for the descendants of Esau. As the
descendants of Esau we cannot admit you to rights placing you on an
equality with ourselves. You must rest content with what rights we
grant to you.” It cannot be said, that this reply from the
President was inspired by malice or anger. President Kruger had been
taught from his childhood the stories of the Old Testament, and he
believed them to be true. How can we blame a man who gives candid
expression to his opinions such as they are? Ignorance, however, is
bound to do harm even when associated with candour, and the result
was that in 1885 a very drastic law was rushed through the Volksraad,
as if thousands of Indians were on the point of flooding the
Transvaal. The British Agent was obliged to move in the matter at the
instance of Indian leaders.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

every Indian settling in the Republic for the purpose of carrying on
trade was required to register at a cost of twentyfive pounds subject
to heavy penalties, and no Indian could hold an inch of land or enjoy
the rights of citizenship. All this was so manifestly unjust that the
Transvaal Government could not defend it in argument. There was a
treaty subsisting between the Boers and the British known as the
London Convention, Article XIV of which secured the rights of British
subjects.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

A dispute thus arose between the British and the Boer Governments,
and the matter was referred to arbitration. The arbitrator’s award
was unsatisfactory. He tried to please both parties. The Indians were
therefore the losers. The only advantage  they reaped, if advantage
it can be called, was that they did not lose as much as they might
have done otherwise. The Law was amended in 1886 in accordance with
the arbitrator’s award. The registration fee was reduced from
twenty-five to three pounds. The clause which completely debarred
Indians from holding landed property was removed, and it was
provided, instead, that the Indians could own fixed property in such
locations, wards and streets as were specially set apart for their
residence by the Transvaal Government. This Government did not
honestly carry out the terms of the amended clause, and withheld from
Indians the right to purchase freehold land even   in   the  
locations.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2      </font></sup>In
  all   towns  inhabited   by   Indians,   these locations were
selected in dirty places situated far away from the towns where there
was no water-supply, no lighting arrangement and no sanitary
convenience to speak of. Thus the Indians became the Panchamas<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

the Transvaal. It can be   truly  said  that  there  is  no
difference between these locations and the untouchables’ quarters
in India. Just as the Hindus believe that touching Dhedhs or
residence in their neighbourhood would lead  to  pollution,  so  did 
the Europeans in the Transvaal believe for all practical purposes
that physical contact with the Indians or living near them would

them. Again the Transvaal Government interpreted Law 3 of 1885 to
mean that the Indians could trade, too, exclusively in the locations.
The arbitrator had decided that the interpretation of the law rested
with the ordinary tribunals of the Transvaal. The Indian traders were
therefore in a very awkward condition. Still they managed to maintain
their position fairly well by carrying on negotiations in one place,
by having recourse to law courts in another, and by exerting what
little influence  they  possessed  in  a  third.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

We shall now turn to examine the position in the Free State. Hardly a
dozen Indians had opened shops there when the Europeans started a
powerful agitation. The Volksraad passed a stringent law and expelled
all Indian traders from the Free State, awarding  them  nominal
compensation. That law provided that no Indian could on any account
hold fixed property or carry on mercantile or farming business or
enjoy franchise rights in the Free State. With special permission an
Indian could settle as a labourer or as a hotel waiter. But the
authorities were not obliged to grant even this precious permission
in every case. The result was that a respectable Indian could not
live in the Free State even for a couple of days without great
difficulty. At the time of the Boer War there were no Indians in the
Free State except a few waiters.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

In the Cape Colony, too, there was some newspaper agitation against
Indians, and the treatment to which they were subjected was not free
from humiliating features. For example,  Indian  children could not
attend public schools, etc., and Indian  travellers  could hardly
secure accommodation in hotels. But there were no restrictions as to
trade and the purchase of land for a long time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 102%">
There were reasons for this state of things. As we have already seen,
there was a fair proportion of the Malays in the population of the
Cape Colony in general and of Cape Town in particular. As the Malays
are Mussalmans, they soon came in contact with their Indian
co-religionists, and consequently with other Indians later  on.
Moreover, some Indian Mussalmans married Malay women.</p>

How  could  the  Government  of   the   Cape   Colony   legislate
against the Malays? The Cape was their mother land, Dutchwas their
mother tongue, they had been living with the Dutch from the very
first and therefore largely imitated them in their ways of life. The
Cape Colony, therefore, has been the least affected by colour
prejudice.</p>

Again as the Cape Colony was the oldest settlement and the chief
centre of culture in South Africa, it produced sober, gentlemanly and
large-hearted Europeans. In my opinion, there is no place on earth
and no race which is not capable of producing the finest types of
humanity, given suitable opportunities and education. It has been my
good fortune to come across this class of people in all parts of
South Africa. In the Cape Colony, however, the proportion of such
persons was very much the larger. Perhaps the best known and the most
learned among them is Mr. Merriman who was a member of the first and
subsequent ministries that came to power after the grant of
responsible government to the Cape Colony in 1872, was again the
Premier in the last ministry when the Union was established in 1910,
and was known as the Gladstone of South Africa. Then there are the
Moltenos and the Schreiners. Sir John Molteno was the first Premier
of the Colony in 1872. Mr. W.P. Schreiner was a wellknown advocate,
for some time Attorney-General and later on Premier. His sister,
Olive Schreiner, was a gifted lady popular in South Africa and well
known wherever the English language is spoken. Ever since she wrote
the book, she became famous as the authoress of <i>Dreams</i>. Her
love for all mankind was unbounded. Love was written in her eyes.
Although she belonged to such a distinguished family and was a
learned lady, she was so simple in habits that she cleaned utensils
in her house herself. Mr. Merriman, the Moltenos and the Schreiners
had always espoused the cause of the Negroes. Whenever the rights of
the Negroes were in danger, they stoutly stood up in their defence.
They had kindly feelings for the Indians as well, though they made a
distinction between Negroes and Indians. Their argument was that as
the Negroes had been the inhabitants of South Africa long before the
European settlers, the latter could not deprive them of their natural
rights. But as for the Indians, it would not be unfair if laws
calculated to remove the danger of their undue competition were
enacted. All the same they had a warm corner in their hearts for
Indians. When Gokhale went to South Africa, Mr. Schreiner presided
over the Townhall meeting in Cape Town, where he was accorded his
first public reception in that country. Mr. Merriman also treated him
with great courtesy and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
expressed his sympathy with the Indian cause. There were
otherEuropeans of the type of Mr. Merriman. I have mentioned these
well-known names as typical of their class. The newspapers in Cape
Town, too, were less hostile to Indians than in other parts of South
Africa.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
While it is true that for these reasons there has always been less
race hatred in the Cape Colony than in other parts, it is but natural
that the anti-Indian feeling which constantly found expression in the
other colonies also found its way to the Cape. There too two laws
copied from Natal were passed, namely, the Immigration Restriction
Act and the Dealers’ Licenses Act.</p>

It can be said that the door in South Africa, which was formerly wide
open, had thus been almost closed against Indians at the time of the
Boer War. In the Transvaal there was no restriction on immigration
except the registration fee of three pounds. When Natal and the Cape
Colony closed their ports to Indians, they had difficulty in landing
on their way to the Transvaal which was in the interior. They could
reach it <i>via </i>Delagoa Bay, a Portuguese port. But the
Portuguese also more or less imitated the British. It must be
mentioned that some stray Indians were able to find their way to the
Transvaal <i>via </i>Natal or Delagoa Bay by suffering great
hardships or by bribing port officers.</p>

While considering the position of Indians in the previous chapters,
we have seen to some extent how they withstood the attacks made upon

Up till 1893 there were hardly any free and well-educated  Indians in
South Africa capable of espousing the Indian cause. English-knowing
Indians were mostly clerks whose knowledge of English was only
commensurate with the needs of their occupation and not adequate for
drafting representations, and who, again, must give all their time to
their employers. A second group of English-educated Indians was
composed of such of them as were born in South Africa. They were
mostly the descendants of indentured labourers, and if at all
qualified for the work, were in Government</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.39cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
service as interpreters in law courts. Thus they were not in a
positionto help the Indian cause beyond expressing their
fellow-feeling.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 102%">
Again, indentured and ex-indentured labourers hailed mainly from
Uttar Pradesh and Madras State, while, as we have already seen, the
Mussalmans, mostly traders, and the Hindus, mostly clerks, who
chiefly represented the class of free Indians, belonged to Gujarat.
Besides, there were a few Parsi traders and clerks, but the total
population of Parsis in South Africa did not probably exceed thirty
or forty souls. A fourth group among free Indians was composed of
Sindhi traders. There were two hundred or more Sindhis in South
Africa. Wherever the Sindhi has settled outside India he  deals  in
‘fancy goods’, namely, silks and brocades, carved boxes and other
furniture made of ebony, sandalwood and ivory and similar goods. His
customers are mainly Europeans.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
Indentured labourers were called ‘coolies’ by the Europeans. A
‘coolie’ means a porter. The expression was used so extensively
that the indentured labourers began to describe themselves as
‘coolies’! Hundreds of Europeans called Indian lawyers and Indian
traders ‘coolie’ lawyers and ‘coolie’ traders. There were
some Europeans who were unable to perceive or believe that the name
implied an insult, but many used it as a term of deliberate contempt.
Free Indians, therefore, tried to differentiate themselves from the
indentured labourers. For this and other reasons peculiar to
conditions in India, a distinction was sought to be drawn in South
Africa  between  indentured and freed labourers on the one hand and
free Indians on the other.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
Free Indians and especially the Mussalman traders undertook to resist
the wrongs detailed above, but no direct attempt was made to seek the
co-operation of the indentured and ex-indentured labourers. Probably
it did not occur to anyone to enlist their support; if the idea did
suggest itself to some, there was in their opinion the risk that
matters might be made worse by their being allowed to join the
movement. And as it was considered that the free traders were the
chief target of attack, the measures for defence were limited to that
class. It can be truly said that free Indians fought well against
difficulties, seeing that they were thus seriously handicapped, that
they were ignorant of English, and that they had had no experience of
public work in India. They sought the help of European barristers,
had petitions prepared, waited upon the authorities on some occasions</p>

in deputation, and did what they could to mend matters. This was the
state of things up till 1893.</p>

It will be helpful to the reader to bear some important dates in
mind. Before 1893 Indians had been hounded out of the Orange Free
State. In the Transvaal, Law 3 of 1885 was in force. In Natal,
measures, calculated to enable only indentured labourers to live in
the colony and to turn out the rest, were under contemplation, and
responsible government had been achieved to that end.</p>

I left India for South Africa in April, 1893. I had no idea of the
previous history of the Indian emigrants. I went there on a purely
professional visit. A well-known firm of Porbandar Memans then
carried on trade in Durban under the name and  style  of Dada
Abdulla. An equally well-known and rival firm traded at Pretoria
under the designation of Taib Haji Khanmamad<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. Unfortunately, an important law-suit was pending
between the rivals. A partner of the firm of Dada Abdulla who was in
Porbandar thought that it would help their case if they engaged me
and sent me to South Africa. I had been just called to the bar and
was quite a novice in the profession, but he had no fear of my
mishandling their case, as he did not want me to conduct the case in
the court but only to instruct the able South African lawyers they
had retained. I was fond of novel experiences. I loved to see fresh
fields and pastures new. It was disgusting to have to give commission
to those who brought me work. The atmosphere of intrigue in
Saurashtra was choking to me. The engagement was only for one year. I
did not see any objection to my accepting it. I had nothing to lose
as Messrs Dada Abdulla expressed their willingness to pay my
travelling expenses as well as the expenses that would be incurred in
South Africa and a fee of one hundred and five pounds. This
arrangement had been made through my elder brother, now deceased, who
was as father to me. For me his will was a command. He liked the idea
of my going to South Africa. So I reached Durban in May 1893.</p>

Being a barrister-at-law, I was well dressed according to my lights
and landed at Durban with a due sense of my importance. But I was
soon disillusioned. The partner of Dada Abdulla who had engaged me
had given me an account of what things were like in Natal. But what I
saw there with my own eyes absolutely belied his misleading picture.
My informant was, however, not to blame. He was</p>

a frank, simple man, ignorant of the real state of affairs. He had no
idea of the hardships to which Indians were subjected in
Natal.Conditions which implied grave insult had not appeared to him
in that light. I observed on the very first day that the Europeans
meted out most insulting treatment to Indians.</p>

I will not describe my bitter experience in the courts within a
fortnight of my arrival, the hardships I encountered on railway
trains, the thrashings I received on the way and the difficulty in
and the practical impossibility of securing accommodation in hotels.
Suffice it to say that all these experiences sank in me. I had gone
there only for  a single case prompted by self-interest and
curiosity. During the first year, therefore, I was merely the witness
and the victim of these wrongs. I then awoke to a sense of my duty. I
saw that from the standpoint of self-interest South Africa was no
good to me. Not only did I not desire but I had a positive aversion
to earning money or sojourning in a country where I was insulted. I
was on the horns of a dilemma. Two courses were open to me. I might
either free myself from the contract with Messrs Dada Abdulla on the
ground that circumstances had come to my knowledge which had not been
disclosed to me before, and run back to India. Or I might bear all
hardships and fulfil my engagement. I was pushed out of the train by
a police constable at Maritzburg, and the train having left, was
sitting in the waiting room, shivering in the bitter cold. I did not
know where my luggage was, nor did I dare to inquire of anybody, lest
I might be insulted and assaulted once again. Sleep was out of the
question. Doubt took possession of my mind. Late at night, I came to
the conclusion that to run back to India would be cowardly. I must
accomplish what I had undertaken. I must reach Pretoria, without
minding insults and even assaults. Pretoria was my goal. The case was
being fought out there. I made up my mind to take some steps, if that
was possible, side by side with my work. This resolution somewhat
pacified and strengthened me but I did not get any sleep.</p>

Next morning I wired to the firm of Dada Abdulla and to the General 
Manager  of  the  Railway.  Replies  were  received  from Dada
Abdulla and his partner Sheth Abdulla Haji Adam Jhaveri who was then
in  Natal  took  strong  measures.  They  wired  to  their Indian
agents in  various  places  to  look  after  me.  They  likewise  saw
the General Manager. The Indian traders of Maritzburg came to see me
in response to  the  telegram  received  by  the  local  agent. They
tried to comfort me and told me that all of them had had the</p>

same bitter experiences as myself, but they did not mind such things,
being habituated to them. Trade and sensitiveness could ill  go
together. They had therefore made it a principle to pocket insults as
they might pocket cash. They told me how Indians could not enter the
railway station by the main gate and how difficult it was for them to
purchase tickets. I left for Pretoria the same night. The Almighty
Searcher of all hearts put my determination to a full test. I
suffered further insults and received more beatings on my way to
Pretoria. But all this only confirmed me in my determination.</p>

Thus in 1893, I obtained full experience of the condition of Indians
in South Africa. But I did nothing beyond occasionally talking with
the Indians in Pretoria on the subject. It appeared to me that to
look after the firm’s case and to take up the question of the
Indian grievances in South Africa at the same time was impossible. I
could see that trying to do both would be to ruin both. 1894 was thus
already upon us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I returned to Durban and   prepared  to  return  to
India. At the farewell entertainment held by Dada Abdulla, someone
put a copy of the <i>Natal Mercury </i>in my hands. I read it and
found that the detailed report of the proceedings of the Natal
Legislative Assembly contained a few lines under the caption ‘Indian
Franchise’. The local Government was about to introduce a Bill to
disfranchise Indians, which could only be the beginning of the end of
what little rights they were then enjoying. The speeches made at the
time left no doubt about the intention of the Government. I read the
report to the traders and others present and explained the situation
to them as best I could. I was not in possession of all the facts. I
suggested that the Indians should strenuously resist this attack on
their rights. They agreed but declared their inability to fight the
battle themselves and urged me to stay on. I consented to stay a
month or so longer by which time the struggle would be fought out.
The same night I drew up a petition<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

be presented to the Legislative Assembly. A telegram was sent to the

impression although it failed to defeat the Bill, the later history
of which I have narrated in Chapter IV. This was the South African
Indians’ first experience of such agitation, and a new thrill of
enthusiasm passed through the community. Meetings were held every day
and more and more persons attended them. The requisite funds were
over-subscribed. Many volunteers helped in preparing copies, securing
signatures and similar work without any remuneration. There were
others who both worked and subscribed to the funds. The descendants
of the ex-indentured Indians joined the movement with alacrity. They
knew English and wrote a fine hand. They did copying and other work
ungrudgingly day and night. Within a month a memorial with ten
thousand signatures was forwarded to Lord Ripon, and the immediate
task I had set before myself was done.</p>

I asked for leave to return home. But the agitation had aroused such
keen interest among the Indians that they would not let me go. They
said: “You yourself have explained to us that this is the first
step taken with a view to our ultimate extinction. Who knows whether
the Colonial Secretary will return a favourable reply to our
memorial? You have witnessed our enthusiasm. We are willing and ready
to work. We have funds too. But for want of a guide, what little has
been done will go for nothing. We therefore think it is your duty to
stay on.” I also felt that it would be well if a permanent
organization was formed to watch Indian interests. But where was I to
live and how? They offered me a regular salary, but I expressly
declined. One may not receive a large salary for public work. Besides
I was a pioneer. According to my notions at the time, I thought I
should live in a style usual for barristers and reflecting credit on
the community, and that would mean great expense. It would be
improper to depend for my maintenance upon a body whose activities
would necessitate a public appeal for funds, and my power of
workwould be thereby crippled. For this and similar reasons I flatly
refused to accept remuneration for public work. But I suggested that
I was prepared to stay  if  the principal traders among them could
see their way to giving me legal work and giving me retainers for it
beforehand. The retainers might be for a year. We might deal with
each other for that period, examine the results, and then continue
the arrangement if both parties were agreeable. This suggestion was
cordially accepted by all.</p>

I applied for admission as an advocate of the Supreme Court of Natal.
The Natal Law Society opposed my application on the sole ground that

advocate, who was Attorney-General and afterwards also Premier of
Natal,   was    my    counsel.    The    prevailing    practice   
for    a long time was that the leading barrister should present such
applications without any fees, and Mr. Escombe advocated my cause
accordingly. He was also Senior Counsel for my employers. The Senior
Court overruled  the  Law  Society’s objection,  and  granted my
application. Thus the Law Society’s opposition brought me into
further prominence without their wishing it. The newspapers of South
Africa ridiculed the Law Society and some of them even  congratulated
me.</p>

The temporary committee was placed on a permanent footing. I had
never attended a session of the Indian National Congress, but had
read about it. I had seen Dadabhai, the Grand Old Man of India, and
admired him. I was therefore a Congress devotee, and wished to
popularize the name. Inexperienced as I was, I did not try to find
out a new name. I was also afraid of committing a mistake. So I
advised the Indians to call their organization the Natal Indian
Congress. I laid before them very imperfectly what meagre knowledge I
had of the Indian National Congress. Anyhow the Natal Indian Congress
was founded about May<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

</font></sup>There was this  difference  between  the Indian and the
Natal Congress, that the latter organization worked throughout the
year and those who paid an annual subscription of at least three
pounds were admitted to membership. Amounts exceeding that sum were
gratefully received. Endeavours were made to obtain the maximum
amount from each member. There were about half a dozen members who
paid twenty-four pounds a year. There was a considerable number of
those paying twelve pounds. About three hundred members were enrolled
in a month. They included Hindus, Musalmans, Parsis and Christians,
and came from all Indian States that were represented in Natal. The
work proceeded with great vigour throughout the first year. The
well-to-do traders went around far off villages in their own
conveyances, enrolling new members and collecting subscriptions.
Everybody did not pay for the mere asking. Some required to be
persuaded. This persuasion was a  sort  of  political training, and

situation. Again, a meeting of the Congress was held at least once a
month, when detailed  accounts  were  presented  and  adopted. 
Current events were explained and recorded in the minute-book.
Members asked various questions. Fresh subjects were considered.  The
advantage of all this was that those who never spoke at such meetings
got accustomed to do so. The speeches again must be in proper form.
All this was a novel experience. The community was deeply interested.
In the meanwhile the welcome news came that Lord Ripon had disallowed
the Disfranchising Bill, and this redoubled their zeal and
self-confidence.</p>

Side by side with external agitation, the question of internal
improvement was also taken up. The Europeans throughout South Africa
had been agitating against Indians on the ground of their ways of
life. They always argued that the Indians were very dirty and
close-fisted. They lived in the same place where they traded. Their
houses were mere shanties. They would not spend money even on their
own comforts. How could cleanly open handed Europeans with their
multifarious wants compete in trade with such parsimonious and dirty
people? Lectures were therefore delivered, debates held, and
suggestions made at Congress meetings on subjects such as domestic
sanitation, personal hygiene, the necessity  of having  separate
buildings for houses and shops and, for well-to-do traders, of living
in a style befitting their position. The proceedings were conducted
in Gujarati.</p>

The reader can see what an amount of practical and political
education the Indians thus received. Under the auspices of the
Congress, the Natal Indian Educational Association was formed for the
benefit of the young Indians, who, being the children of
ex-indentured labourers, were born in Natal and spoke English. Its
members paid a nominal fee. The chief objects of the Association were
to provide a meeting place for those youths, to create in them a love
for the mother country and to give them general information about it.
It was also intended to impress upon them that free Indians
considered them as their own kith and kin, and to create respect for
the latter in the minds of the former. The funds of the Congress were
large enough to leave a surplus after defraying its expenses. This
was devoted to the purchase of land which yields an income to the
present day.</p>

existence and how the Indians went through a natural course of
preparation for it. I am compelled to omit the remarkable subsequent
history of the Congress, how it was confronted with difficulties, how
Government officials attacked and how it escaped scatheless from 
their attacks. But one fact must be placed on record. Steps were
taken to save the community from the habit of exaggeration. Attempts
were always made to draw their attention to their own shortcomings.
Whatever force there was in the arguments of the Europeans was duly
acknowledged. Every occasion, when it was possible to co-operate with
the Europeans on terms of equality and consistent  with self-respect
was heartily availed of. The newspapers were supplied with as much
information about the Indian movement as they could publish, and
whenever Indians were unfairly attacked in the Press replies were
sent to the newspapers concerned.</p>

with Zulu manners and customs. He was a man of a very quiet and
amiable disposition. He was not given to much speech. I have entered
into these details in order to show that for holding responsible
positions, truthfulness, patience, tolerance, firmness, presence of
mind, courage and common sense are far more essential qualifications
than a knowledge of English or mere learning. Where these fine
qualities are absent, the best literary attainments are of little use
in public work.</p>

I returned to India in the middle of the year 1896. As steamers from
Natal were then more easily available for Calcutta than for Bombay, I
went on board one bound for that city. For the indentured labourers
were embarked from Calcutta or Madras. While proceeding to Bombay
from Calcutta, I missed my train on the way and had to stop in
Allahabad for a day. My work commenced there. I saw Mr. Chesney of
the <i>Pioneer. </i>He talked with me courteously, but told me
frankly that his sympathies were with the Colonials. He, however,
promised that if I wrote anything, he would read it and notice it in
his paper. This was good enough for me.</p>

I cannot, however, resist the temptation of describing here a sacred
reminiscence of Poona, although it is not strictly relevant to our
subject. The Sarvajanik Sabha was controlled by the  Lokamanya, while
Shri Gokhale was connected with the Deccan Sabha.I first saw Tilak
Maharaj. When I spoke to him about my intention to hold a meeting in
Poona, he asked me if I had seen Gopalrao. I did not understand whom
he meant. He therefore asked me again if I had seen Shri Gokhale and
if I knew him.</p>

“I have not yet seen him. I know him by name and mean to see him,”
I replied.</p>

“You do not seem to be familiar with Indian politics,” said the
Lokamanya.</p>

“I stayed in India only for a short time after my return from
England, and had not then applied myself to political questions, as I
thought it beyond my capacity,” I said.</p>

Lokamanya then said: “In that case I must give you some
information. There are two parties in Poona, one represented by the
Sarvajanik Sabha and the other by the Deccan Sabha.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.14cm">I
replied: “I know something about this  matter.”</p>

Lokamanya: “It is easy to hold a meeting here. But it seems to me
that you wish to lay your case before all the parties here and seek
to enlist the support of all. I like your idea. But if a member of
the Sarvajanik Sabha is selected to preside over your meeting, no
member of the Deccan Sabha will attend it. Similarly, if a member of
the Deccan Sabha were to preside, members of the Sarvajanik  Sabha 
would absent themselves. You should therefore find  out  a
non-partisan as chairman. I can only offer suggestions in the matter,
and shall not be able to render any other assistance. Do you know
Prof. Bhandarkar? Even if you do not know him, you should see him. He
is considered a neutral. He does not take part in politics, but
perhaps you can induce him to preside over your meeting. Speak to
Shri Gokhale about this, and seek his advice too. In all probability
he will give you the same advice. If a man of the position of Prof.
Bhandarkar consents to preside, I am certain that both the parties
will see to it that a good meeting is held. At any rate you can count
upon our fullest help in the matter.”</p>

then saw Gokhale. I have written elsewhere how I fell in love</p>

Accordingly I paid my respects to the venerable Professor. He heard
attentively the story of the Indian wrongs in Natal and said, “You
see I rarely take part in public life. Then again, I am getting old.
But what you have told me has stirred me deeply. I like your idea of
seeking the co-operation of all parties. You are young and ignorant
of political conditions in India. Tell the members of both the
parties that I have agreed to your request. On an intimation from any
of them that the meeting is to be held, I will certainly come and
preside.” A successful meeting was held in Poona. The leaders of
both the parties attended and spoke in support of my cause.</p>

I then went to Madras. There I saw Sir (then Mr. Justice) Subrahmanya
Aiyar, Shri P. Anandacharlu, Shri G. Subrahmanyam, the then editor of
<i>The </i><i>Hindu, </i>Shri Parameshvaran Pillai, editor of <i>The
</i><i>Madras Standard, </i>Shri Bhashyam Iyengar, the famous
advocate, Mr. Norton and others. A great meeting too was held. From
Madras I went to Calcutta, where I saw Surendranath Banerji, Maharaja
Jyotindra Mohan Tagore, the late Mr. Saunders, editor of <i>The

a meeting was being arranged in Calcutta, I received a cablegram from
Natal asking me to return at once. This was in November 1896. I
concluded that some movement hostile to the Indians must be on foot.
I therefore left my work at  Calcutta incomplete and went to Bombay,
where I took the first available steamer with my family. s. s.
<i>Courland </i>had been purchased by Messrs Dada Abdulla and
represented one more enterprise of that very adventurous firm,
namely, to run a steamer between Porbandar and Natal. The <i>Naderi,
</i>a steamer of the Persian Steam Navigation Company, left Bombay
for Natal immediately after The total number of passengers on the two
steamers was about 800.</p>

Reuter to send cablegrams about it to England.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>This
I came to know on reaching Natal. Reuter’s representative in
England had sent a brief cablegram to South Africa, containing an
exaggerated summary of my speeches in India. This is not an unusual
experience. Such exaggeration is not always intentional. Very busy
people with prejudices and prepossessions of their own read 
something superficially and then prepare a summary which is
sometimespartly a product of imagination. This summary, again, is
differently interpreted in different places. Distortion thus takes
place without anyone intending it. This is the risk attending public
activities and this is also their limitation. While in India I had
criticized the Europeans of Natal. I had spoken very strongly against
the £3 tax on indentured labourers. I had given a vivid account of
the sufferings of an indentured labourer named Subrahmanyam who had
been assaulted by his master, whose wounds I had seen and whose case
was in my hands. When the Europeans in Natal read the distorted
summary of my speeches, they were greatly exasperated against me. The
remarkable fact, however, was that what I had written in Natal was
more severe and detailed than what I wrote and spoke in India. My
speeches in India were free from the slightest exaggeration. On the
other hand, as I knew from experience that if we describe an event to
a stranger, he sees more in it than what we intend to convey, I had
deliberately described the South African situation in India  less 
forcibly than the facts warranted. But very few Europeans would read
what I wrote in Natal, and still fewer would care for it. The case,
however, was obviously different with my speeches and writings in
India. Thousands of Europeans would read Reuter’s summaries.
Moreover, a subject which is considered worthy of being communicated
by cablegram becomes invested with an importance it does not
intrinsically possess. The Europeans of Natal thought that my work in
India carried the weight attributed to it by them and that therefore
the system of indentured labour would perhaps come to an end, and
hundreds of European planters would suffer in consequence. Besides,
they felt blackened before India.</p>

The reader will remember that bubonic plague made its first
appearance in India in 1896. In their effort to prevent our landing
the Government of Natal were hampered by legal difficulties as the
Immigration Restriction Act had not yet come it being. Otherwise
their sympathies were entirely with the Committee of Europeans
referred to above. The late Mr. Escombe, a member of the Government,
took a prominent part in the proceedings of that Committee. It was he
who instigated them. There is a rule in force at all ports that if a
case of contagious disease occurs on board a steamer, or if a steamer
coming from an infected port it is detained in quarantine for a
certain period. This restriction can be imposed only on sanitary
grounds, and under orders from the Health Officer of the port. The
Government of Natal abused their power by enforcing the above rule
for political purposes. Although there was no contagious disease on
board, both the steamers were detained far beyond the usual
time-limit, for as many as twenty-three days. Meanwhile, the
Committee of Europeans continued their activities. Messrs Dada
Abdulla, who were the owners of the <i>Courland </i>and the agents
for the <i>Naderi</i>, were subjected to a severe hectoring by them.
Inducements were offered to them if they agreed to take back the
passengers, and they were threatened with loss of business if they
refused to do so. But the partners of the firm were no cowards. They
said they did not care</p>

if they were ruined; they would fight to the bitter end but would not
be coerced into committing the crime of sending away those helpless
but innocent passengers; they were no strangers to patriotism. The
old advocate of the firm, Mr. F. A. Laughton, K.C., was also a brave
man.</p>

As luck would have it, the late Shri Mansukhlal Hiralal Nazar, a
Kayastha gentleman from Surat and a nephew of the late Mr. Justice
Nanabhai Haridas, reached Africa about the same time.  I  did  not 
know  him,  nor  was  I  aware  of  his  going.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>I  need scarcely say that I had no hand in bringing the
passengers who arrived by the <i>Naderi </i>and the <i>Courland. </i>Most
of them were old residents of South Africa. Many again were bound for
the Transvaal. Threatening notices were served by the Committee of
Europeans even upon these passengers. The captains of the steamers
read them out to the passengers. The notices expressly stated that
the Europeans of Natal were in a dangerous temper and said in effect
that if in spite of the warning the Indian passengers attempted to
land, the members of the Committee would attend at the port and push
every Indian into the sea. I interpreted this notice to the
passengers on the <i>Courland. </i>An English-knowing passenger on
board the <i>Naderi </i>did the same for his fellow-passengers. The
passengers on both the steamers flatly declined to go back and added
that many of them were proceeding to the Transvaal, that some of the
rest were old residents of Natal, that in any case everyone of them
was legally entitled to land and that, the threats of the Committee
notwithstanding, they were determined to land in order to test their
right to do so.</p>

The Government of Natal was at its wit’s end. How long could an
unjust restriction be enforced? Twenty-three days had passed already.
Dada Abdulla did not flinch, nor did the passengers. The quarantine
was thus lifted after 23 days and the steamers were permitted to
steam into harbour. Meanwhile, Mr. Escombe pacified the excited
Committee of Europeans. At a meeting which was held, he said, “The
Europeans in Durban have displayed commendable unity and courage. You
have done all you could. Government has also helped you. The Indians
were detained for 23 days. You have given sufficient expression to
your sentiments and your public spirit. That will make a profound
impression on the Imperial Government. Your action has made the path

that the Government of Natal will obtain from the Legislative Council

is only a summary of Mr. Escombe’s speech. His audience was
disappointed, but he had great influence over the Europeans of Natal.

came into port.</p>

A message reached me from Mr. Escombe advising me not to land with
the others but to wait until evening when he would send the
Superintendent of Water Police to escort me home, and adding that my
family were free to land at any time. This was not an order according
to law, but was by way of advice to the captain not to allow me to
land and of warning to me of the danger that was hanging over my
head. The captain had not the power forcibly to prevent me from
landing. But I came to the conclusion that I should accept this
suggestion. I sent my family to the residence of my old friend and
client, Parsi Rustomji, instead of to my own place, and told them
that I would meet them there. When the passengers had disembarked,
Mr. Laughton, counsel for Dada Abdulla and a personal friend of mine,
came up and met me. He asked me why I had not yet landed. I told him
about Mr. Escombe’s letter. He said that he did not like the idea
of my waiting till evening and then entering the city like a thief or
offender, that if I was not afraid, I should accompany him there and
then, and that we would walk to the town as if nothing had happened. 
I replied: “I do not think I am afraid. It is only  a  question  of
propriety whether or not I should accept Mr. Escombe’s suggestion.
And we should also consider whether the captain of the steamer is
responsible in the matter.” Mr. Laughton smiled and said: “What
has Mr. Escombe done for you that you must needs heed his suggestion?
And what reason have you to believe that he is actuated by kindliness
and not by some ulterior motive? I know more than you what has
happened in the town, and what hand Mr. Escombe had in the happenings
there.” I interrupted him with a shaking of the head. “We might
assume,” continued Mr. Laughton, “that he is actuated by the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
best of motives. But I am positively of opinion that if you comply
with his suggestion, you will stand humiliated. I would, therefore,
advise you, if you are ready, to accompany me just now. The captain
is our man, and his responsibility is our responsibility. He is
accountable only to Dada Abdulla. I know what they will think of the
matter, as they have displayed great courage in the present
struggle.” I replied: “Let us then go. I have no preparations to
make. All I have to do is to put on my turban. Let us inform the
captain and start”. We took the captain’s leave.</p>

Mr. Laughton was an old and well-known advocate of Durban. I had come
in intimate contact with him before I returnedto India. I used   to  
consult   him    in    difficult    cases    and    often    to
engage him as my senior. He  was  a  brave  and  powerfully-built
man.</p>

Our road lay through the principal street of Durban. It was about
half past four in the evening when we started. The sky was slightly
overcast and the sun was not to be seen. It would take a pedestrian
at least one hour to reach Rustomji Sheth’s place. The number of
persons present about the wharf was not larger than what is to be
usually seen there. As soon as we landed, some boys saw us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

I was the only Indian who put on a turban of a particular type, they
at once recognized me, began to shout ‘Gandhi’, ‘Gandhi’,
‘Thrash him’, ‘Surround him’, and came up towards us. Some
began to throw pebbles at us. A few elderly Europeans joined the
boys. Gradually the party of rioters began to grow. Mr. Laughton
thought that there was danger in our going on foot. He therefore
hailed a rickshaw. I had never sat in a rickshaw before, as it was
thoroughly disgusting to me to sit in a vehicle pulled by human
beings. But I then felt that it was my duty to use that vehicle. I
have experienced five or seven times in my life that one whom God
wishes to save cannot fall even if he will. If I did not fall I
cannot take any credit for it to myself. These rickshaws are pulled
by Zulus. The elderly Europeans and the boys threatened the
rickshaw-puller that if he allowed me to sit in his rickshaw they
would beat him and smash his rickshaw to pieces. The rickshaw boy,
therefore, said ‘Kha’ (meaning ‘no’) and went away. I  was 
thus spared the shame of a rickshaw ride.</p>

and larger. The gathering was enormous when we reached West Street. A
man of powerful build took hold of Mr. Laughton and tore him away
from me. He was not therefore in a position to come up with me. The
crowd began to abuse me and shower upon me stones and whatever else
they could lay their hands on. They threw down my turban. Meanwhile a
burly fellow came up to me, slapped me in the face and then kicked
me. I was  about  to  fall  down  unconscious when I held on to the
railings of a house near by. I  took breath for  a  while  and  when 
the  fainting  was  over,  proceeded  on  my   way.  I had almost
given up the hope of reaching home alive.  ButI  remember well that
even then my heart did not arraign  my assailants.</p>

While I was thus winding my way, the wife of the Superintendent of
Police<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>at Durban was coming  from  the  opposite  direction. 
We knew each other well. She was a brave lady. Although the sky was
cloudy and the sun about to set, she opened her sunshade for my
protection and began to walk at my side. The Europeans would not
insult a lady, especially the wife of the old and  popular
Superintendent of Police, nor would they hurt her. They must avoid
injuring her while aiming blows at me. The injuries, therefore, which
I received after she joined me were not serious. Meanwhile the
Superintendent of Police came to know of the attack upon me and sent
a party of constables for my protection. The police surrounded me.
The Police Station was on our way. When we reached there I saw that
the Superintendent of Police was waiting for us. He offered me asylum
in the Police Station, but I declined the offer with thanks and said,
“I must reach my destination. I have faith in the fair play of the
citizens of Durban and in the righteousness of my own cause. I am
thankful to you for sending the police party for my protection. Mrs.
Alexander too has contributed to my safety.”</p>

I reached Rustomji’s house without further trouble. It  was  nearly
evening when I reached there. Dr. Dadibarjor, the medical officer of
the <i>Courland, </i>who was with Rustomji Sheth, began to treat me.
He examined my wounds. There were not many of them. One blind wound
in particular was very painful. But I was not yet privileged to rest
in peace. Thousands of Europeans gathered before Rustomji Sheth’s
house. After nightfall, hooligans also joined the crowd. The crowd
sent word to Rustomji Sheth that if he did not hand</p>

Rustomji Sheth was too good an Indian to be daunted. When
Superintendent Alexander came to know how matters  stood,  he 
quietly joined the crowd with a number of detectives. He sent for a
bench and stood upon it. Thus under the pretence of talking to the
crowd he took possession of the entrance to Rustomji’s house so
that none could break and enter it. He had already posted detectives
at proper places. Immediately on arrival, he had  instructed  a 
subordinate to disguise himself as an Indian trader by putting on
Indian dress and painting his face, to see me and deliver tome the
following message: “If you wish to save your friend, his guests and
property, and your own family, I advise you to disguise yourself as
an Indian constable, come out through Rustomji’s godown, steal
through the crowd with my man and reach the Police Station. A
carriage is awaiting you at the corner of the street. This is the
only way in which I can save you and others. The crowd is so excited
that I am not in a position to control it. If you are not prompt in
following my  directions, I am afraid the crowd will raze Rustomji’s
house to the ground and it is impossible for me to imagine how many
lives will be lost and how much property destroyed.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I gauged the situation at once. I quickly disguised myself as a
constable and left Rustomji’s house. The police officer and I
reached the Police Station in safety. In the meantime Mr. Alexander
was humouring the crowd by singing topical songs and talking to them.
When he knew that I had reached the Police  Station,  he  became
serious and asked:</p>

The Superintendent gently smiled and informed the crowd that I had
left Rustomji’s house, passed through their midst, and reached
another place already. The crowd laughed loudly and shouted, “It is

you will peacefully return to your homes. You got excited today and
did not obey the police. That reflects discredit on you, not on the

prey from your midst and you have lost the game. You certainly cannot

The Superintendent addressed the crowd with such suavity and
determination, that they gave him the promise he had asked for. A

Sensible people among the Europeans admitted their mistake. The
newspapers expressed their sympathy with the standpoint of the
Europeans in Natal, but at the same time fully defended my action.

the Government of Natal. Reuter might have cabled any distorted

duty and the duty of the Committee to question me about the

Mr. Escombe said, “I quite understand what you say, and I
appreciate it. I was not prepared to hear that you were not willing
to prosecute your assailants. I would not have been displeased in the
least had you prosecuted them. But since you have signified your
determination not to prosecute, I do not hesitate to say not only
that you have come to a right decision in the matter, but you will
render further service to your community by your self-restraint. I
must at the same time admit that your refusal to prosecute your
assailants will save the Government of Natal from a most awkward
position. If you so desire, the Government will see that your
assailants are arrested, but it is scarcely necessary to tell you
that it would irritate the Europeans and give rise to all manner of
criticism, which no Government would relish. But if you have finally
made up your mind not to prosecute, you should write to me a note
signifying your intention to that effect.  I cannot defend my
Government merely by sending Mr. Chamberlain a summary of our
conversation. I should cable to him a summary of your note. I am not,
however, asking you to let me have the note just now. You had better
consult your friends. Consult Mr. Laughton also. And if after such
consultations you still adhere to your resolution not to prosecute,
write to me. But your note should clearly state that you, on your own
responsibility, refuse to prosecute your assailants. Then</p>

I said: “I had no idea that you had sent for me in  this 
connection. I have not consulted anyone on the subject, nor do I wish
to consult anyone now. When I decided to land and proceed with Mr.
Laughton, I had made up my mind that I should not feel aggrieved in
case I was injured. Prosecuting my assailants is therefore out of the
question. This is a religious question with me, and I believe with
you that I shall serve my community as well as myself by this act of
self-restraint. I propose, therefore, to take all the responsibility

The reader has seen in the previous chapters how the Indians tried to
ameliorate their condition and enhanced their prestige. Side by side
with the effort to develop strength from within they sought such
assistance as they could from India and England. I have dealt to some
extent with the activities in India. It now remains to note what
steps were taken to enlist support from England. It was essential, in
the first place, to establish relations with the British Committee of
the Indian National Congress; weekly letters<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
    </font></sup>with  full  particulars  were therefore written to
Dadabhai, the Grand Old Man of India, and to Sir William Wedderburn,
the Chairman of the Committee and whenever there was an occasion to
send copies of representations, a sum of at least 10 pounds was
remitted as a contribution towards postal charges and the general
expenditure of the Committee.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I shall here place on record a sacred reminiscence of Dadabhai
Naoroji. He was not the chairman of the Committee. It seemed to us,
however, that the proper course for us was to send money to him in
the first instance which he might then forward to the Chairman on our
behalf. But Dadabhai returned the very first instalment sent to him
and suggested that we should remit money, and address communications,
intended for the Committee directly to Sir William</p>

Wedderburn. He himself would certainly render all possible
assistance. But the prestige of the Committee increase only if we
approached the Committee through Sir William. I also observed that
Dadabhai, though far advanced in age, was very regular in his
correspondence. Even when he had nothing particular to write about he
would acknowledge receipt of letters by return of post with a word of
encouragement thrown in. Even such letters he used to write
personally, and kept copies of them in his tissue paper book.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I have shown in a previous chapter that although we had called our
organization the ‘Congress’ we never intended to make our
grievances a party question. We therefore corresponded with gentlemen
belonging to other parties as well, with the full knowledge of
Dadabhai. The most prominent among them were Sir Muncherjee
Bhownuggree and Sir W. W. Hunter. Sir Muncherjee was then aMember  of
 Parliament.  His  assistance  was  valuable,  and  he always used to
favour us with important suggestions. But if there was anyone who had
realized the importance of the Indian question in South Africa before
the Indians themselves and accorded them valuable support, it was Sir
William Wilson Hunter. He was editor of the Indian section of <i>The
Times, </i>where he discussed our question in its true perspective,
ever since we first addressed him in connection with it. He wrote
personal letters to several gentlemen in support of our cause. He
used to write to us almost every week when some important question
was on the anvil. This is the purport of his very first letter: “I
am sorry to read of the situation there. You have been conducting
your struggle courteously, peacefully and without exaggeration. My
sympathies are entirely with you on this question. I will do my best
publicly as well as in private to see that justice is done to you. I
am certain that we cannot yield even an inch of ground in this
matter. Your demand being so reasonable, no impartial person would
even suggest that you should moderate it.” He reproduced the letter
almost word for word in the first article he wrote for <i>The Times
</i>on the question. His attitude remained the same throughout,  and 
Lady Hunter wrote in the course of a letter that shortly before his
death he had prepared an outline of a series of articles which he had
planned on the Indian question.</p>

I have mentioned the name of Shri Mansukhlal Nazar in the last
chapter. This gentleman was deputed to England on behalf of the
Indian community to explain the situation in detail. He was
instructed to work with members of all parties, and during his stay
in England he</p>

kept in touch with Sir W. W. Hunter, Sir Muncherjee Bhownuggree and
the British Committee of the Indian National Congress. He was
likewise in touch with several retired officers of the Indian Civil
Service, with the India Office and with the Colonial Office. Thus our
endeavours were directed in all possible quarters. The result of all
this evidently was that the condition of Indians overseas became a
question of first-rate importance in  the  eyes  of the  Imperial
Government. This fact reacted for good   as  well  as  for  evil  on 
the  other colonies. That is to say, in all the colonies where
Indians had settled, they awoke to the importance of their own
position and the Europeans awoke to the danger which they thought the
Indians were to their predominance.</p>

In 1899<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>, Dr. Jameson carried out his raid on Johannesburg in
pursuance of the conspiracy which he had entered into with the owners
of the gold mines. The conspirators had expected that the Boer
Government would come to know of the raid only after they had
captured Johannesburg. Dr. Jameson and his associates badly blundered
in this calculation of theirs. They fell into another error when they
imagined that even in the event of the plot being discovered,
untrained Boer farmers could do nothing against sharpshooters trained
in Rhodesia. The raiders had likewise expected that a large majority
of the population of Johannesburg would receive them with open arms.
Here too the good Doctor was reckoning without his host. President
Kruger had full information beforehand. With great deliberation,
skill and secrecy he made preparations to  meet Dr. Jameson and
simultaneously arranged to arrest his fellow-conspirators. Dr.
Jameson, therefore, was greeted by the Boers with gunfire before he
had reached anywhere near Johannesburg. The Doctor’s party was in
no position to try conclusions with the army which faced them.
Arrangements were similarly complete for preventing a rising in
Johannesburg. None dared raise their heads and</p>

the millionaires of Johannesburg were dumbfounded in consequence of
President Kruger’s action. The result of his excellent preparations
was that the raid was disposed of with a minimum of loss in men as
well as money.</p>

Dr.  Jameson  and  his  friends,  the  owners  of   gold   mines,
were arrested and placed on their trial without delay. Some were
sentenced to be hanged. Most of these convicts were millionaires; but
the Imperial  Government  could  do  nothing  for  them,  as  they 
were guilty of a raid in broad daylight. President Kruger became an
important  man  all  at  once.  Mr.  Chamberlain,  the  Secretary  
of State for the Colonies, sent a humble  cablegram  to  him,  and 
appealed to his sense of mercy on behalf of the convicted magnates.
President  Kruger  was  perfect  master  of his  own   game.  He  
had no apprehension of his independence being challenged byany power
in South Africa. The conspiracy of Dr. Jameson and his friends was a
well-planned affair in their own eyes, but to President Kruger it
seemed to be an act of insensate folly. He therefore complied with
Mr. Chamberlain’s humble request and not only did not enforce the
sentence of death against any of the convicts, but granted them all
full pardon and set them free.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
But things could not go on like this for any length of time.
President Kruger knew that the Jameson raid was only a minor symptom
of a serious malady. It was impossible that the millionaires of
Johannesburg should not endeavour to wipe out their disgrace by all
means in their power. Again, nothing had been done to carry out the
reforms for which the Jameson raid purported to have been organized.
The millionaires, therefore, were not likely to hold their peace.
Lord Milner, the British High Commissioner in South Africa, had full
sympathy with their demands. Mr. Chamberlain, too, while expressing
his appreciation of President Kruger’s magnanimity towards the
Jameson raiders, had drawn his attention to the necessity for
reforms. Everyone believed that an appeal to the sword was
inevitable. The demands of the Uitlanders were calculated in the end
to extinguish Boer domination in the Transvaal. Both the parties were
aware that the ultimate result would be war, and both were therefore
preparing for it. The war of words which ensued was worthy of note.
When President Kruger ordered out arms and ammunition, the British
Agent warned him that the British would be compelled to bring troops
into South Africa in self-defence. When British  troops  arrived  in
South Africa, President Kruger taunted the British and pushed forward</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-right: 0.39cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
his preparations for war. Thus each side was protesting against the
other’s activities and strengthening its own preparations.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 102%">
When President Kruger had completed his preparations, he saw that to
delay any longer was to play into the hands of his enemies. The
British had an inexhaustible supply of men and money. They could,
therefore, afford to bide their time, gradually preparing for war and
in the meantime ask President Kruger to redress the grievances of
Uitlanders, and thus show to the world that they could not help
waging war as he refused to grant redress. Then they would enter the
war with such grand preparations that the Boers could not stand the
shock and would have to accept British demands in a spirit of
humiliation. Every Boer man between eighteen and sixty years in age
was  a  skilled fighter. Boer women, too, were capable of fighting if
they chose. National independence had with the Boers all the force of
a religious principle. Such a brave people would not suffer
humiliation even at the hands of a world empire.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
President Kruger had already arrived at an understanding with the
Orange Free State. Both the Boer republics followed an identical
policy. President Kruger had not the slightest intention of accepting
the British demands whether in full or even to the extent of
satisfying the Uitlanders. Both the republics, therefore, thought
that war being inevitable, for them to give any more time to the
British was only to give them a chance of advancing their
preparations. President Kruger thereupon delivered an ultimatum to
Lord Milner, and at the same time mobilized troops on the frontiers
of the Transvaal as well as the Free State. The result of such action
was a foregone conclusion. A world empire like the British would not
take a threat lying down. The time-limit laid down in the ultimatum
expired and the  Boers, advancing with lightning speed, laid siege to
Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking. This great war thus broke out in
1899. The reader will remember that one of the causes of the war
alleged by the British was the treatment accorded to the Indians by
the Boers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
The great question as to what the Indians in South Africa should do
on this occasion now presented itself for solution. Among the Boers,
the entire male population joined the war. Lawyers gave up their
practice, farmers their farms, traders their trade, and servants left
their service. The British in South Africa did not join the war in
anything like the same proportion as the Boers. However, a large
number of civilians in Cape Colony, Natal and Rhodesia enrolled</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
themselves as volunteers. Many distinguished English traders and
lawyers followed suit. I now found very few lawyers in the court
where   I was practising as an advocate. Most of the senior members
of the bar were engaged in war work. One of the charges laid against
the Indians was that they went to South Africa only for
money-grubbing and were merely a dead-weight upon the British. Like
worms which settle inside wood and eat it up hollow, the Indians were
in South Africa only to fatten themselves upon them. The Indians
would not render them the slightest aid if the country was invaded or
if their homes were raided. The British in such a case would have not
only to defend themselves against the enemy but at the same time to
protect the Indians. We Indians carefully considered this charge. All
of us felt that this was a golden opportunity for us to prove that it
was baseless. But on the other hand the following considerations were
also urged by some:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
“The British oppress us equally with the Boers. If we are sub-
jected to hardships in the Transvaal, we are not very much better off
in Natal or the Cape Colony. The difference, if any, is only one of
degree. Again, we are more or less a community of slaves; knowing as
we do that a small nation like the Boers is fighting for its very
existence, why should we be instrumental in their destruction?
Finally, from a practical point of view, no one will take it upon
himself to predict a defeat for the Boers. And if they win, they will
never fail to wreak vengeance upon us.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.02cm; line-height: 102%">
There was a powerful party among us which strongly advanced the above
argument. I could understand it and allowed it due weight. However,
it did not commend itself to me, and I refuted it to myself and to
the community as follows:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
“Our existence in South Africa is only in our capacity as British
subjects. In every memorial we have presented, we have asserted our
rights as such. We have been proud of our British citizenship, or
have given our rulers and the world to believe that we are so proud.
Our rulers profess to safeguard our rights because we are British
subjects, and what little rights we still retain, we retain because
we are British subjects. It would be unbecoming to our dignity as a
nation to look on with folded hands at a time when ruin stares the
British as well as ourselves in the face simply because they
ill-treat us here. Any such criminal inaction could only aggravate
our difficulties. If we miss this opportunity, which has come to us
unsought, of proving the falsity of a charge which we believe to be
false, we should stand self-</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
condemned, and it will be no matter for surprise if then the English
treat us worse than before and sneer at us more than ever. The fault
in such a case would lie entirely at our door. To say that the
charges preferred against ourselves had no foundation in fact and
were absolutely untenable, would only be to deceive ourselves. It is
true that we are helots in the Empire, but so far we have tried to
better our condition, continuing the while to remain in the Empire.
That has been the policy of all our leaders in India, and ours too.
And if we desire to win our freedom and achieve our welfare as
members of the British Empire, here is a golden opportunity for us to
do  so  by  helping the British in the war by all the means at our
disposal. It must largely be conceded that justice is on the side of
the Boers. But every single subject of a state must not hope to
enforce his private opinion in all cases. The authorities may not
always be right, but so long as the subjects own allegiance to a
state, it is their clear duty generally to accommodate themselves and
to accord their support to acts of the state.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.06cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
“Again, if any class among the subjects consider that the action of
a government is immoral from a religious standpoint before they help
or hinder it, they must endeavour fully and even at the risk of their
lives to dissuade the Government from pursuing such a course. We have
done nothing of the kind. Such a moral crisis is not present before
us, and no one says that we wish to hold aloof from this war for any
such universal and comprehensive reason. Our ordinary duty as
subjects, therefore, is not to enter into the merits of the war, but,
when war has actually broken out, to render such assistance as we
possibly can. Finally, to suggest that in case the Boers  won,—and 
a  Boer victory was well within the range of possibility,—our last
state would be worse than our first, and the Boers would exact
frightful revenge, would be doing injustice to the chivalrous Boers
as well as to our- selves. To waste the slightest thought upon such a
contingency would only be a sign of our effeminacy and a reflection
on our loyalty. Would an Englishman think for a moment what would
happen to himself if the English lost the war? A man about to join a
war cannot advance such an argument without forfeiting his manhood.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
I advanced these arguments in 1899, and even today I do not see any
reasons for modifying them. That is to say, if I had today the faith
in the British Empire which I then entertained, and if I now
cherished the hope, which I did at that time, of achieving our
freedom under its aegis, I would advance the same arguments, word for
word,</p>

in South Africa, and, in similar circumstances, even in India. I
heard many attempted refutations of these arguments in South Africa
and subsequently in England. But I discovered no ground for changing
my views. I know that my present opinions have no bearing on the
subject of this volume, but there are two valid reasons why I have
adverted to the matter here. I have, in the first place, no right to
expect that the reader who takes up this book in a hurry will give it
a patient and attentive perusal, and such a reader will find it
difficult to  reconcile the above views with my present activities.
Secondly, the underlying principle in the above arguments is
satyagraha, insistence on truth. That one should appear to be as one
really is and should act accordingly, is not the last, but the first
step to practical religion. The building up of a religious life is
impossible without such a foundation.</p>

My arguments commended themselves to many. The  reader must not
suppose that I was the only one to advance them. More- over, even
before these views were set forth, there were many Indians who held
that we should do our bit in the war. But now the practical question
arose: Who would lend an ear to the weak voice of the  Indians when
there was raging this terrible whirlwind of war? What weight would

war. Even the work performed by non-combatants in a war required
training. None of us knew even how to march in step. It was no easy
task to perform long marches with one’s baggage on one’s own
shoulders. Again, the whites would treat us all as ‘coolies’,
insult us and look down upon us. How was all this to be borne? And if
we volunteered for service, how could we induce the Government to
accept our offer? Finally we came to the conclusion that we should
make   earnest   endeavours   to   get   our   offer   accepted<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

serve, that we need not worry how we could do the work entrusted but
should train ourselves for it as best we might, and that having once
decided to serve, we should cease to think of discriminating between
dignified work and other and serve, putting up even with insults if
it came to that.</p>

expected that the Indians would take any part in the war. An

Madrasis and up-country men, all classes and creeds were well

traders subscribed considerable sums of money. The Corps had needs
which were not adequately met by the military rations, and which, if
satisfied, might provide them with some amenities in their hard camp
life. The traders undertook to supply such comforts, and likewise 
rendered good assistance in entertaining the wounded in our charge

The indentured labourers, who joined this Corps, were under the
charge of English overseers from their respective factories. But the
work for them was the same as for ourselves and as we were all to
live together, they were highly pleased at the prospect, and  the
management of the entire Corps naturally passed into  our  hands.
Thus   the   whole   Corps   was   described   as   the   Indian  
Corps, and the community received the credit for its work. As a
matter of fact  the  Indians  were  not  entitled  to  the  credit 
for  the   inclusion of indentured labourers in the Corps, which
should rightly have gone to the planters. But there is no doubt that
the free Indians, that is to say, the Indian community, deserved
credit for the excellent management of the Corps when once it was
formed and this was acknowledged by General Buller in his despatches.</p>

Our offer to Government was absolutely unconditional, but the letter
by which they accepted it granted us immunity from service within the
firing line. This meant that the permanent  Ambulance  Corps attached
to the army was to bear far away the soldiers as they got wounded and
leave them behind the army outside the line of fire. The temporary
Ambulance Corps of Europeans as well as Indians was formed in view of
the great effort which General Buller was to put forth for the relief
of General White in Ladysmith and in which, it was</p>

apprehended, there might be more wounded than could be dealt with by
the permanent Corps. In the country where the armies were operating
there were no made roads between the battlefield and the base
hospital and it was therefore impossible to carry the wounded by
means of ordinary transport. The base-hospital was always situated
near a railway station and at a distance of between seven and
twenty-five miles from the battlefield.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
We soon got work and that too harder than we had expected. To carry
the wounded seven or eight miles was part of our ordinary routine.
But sometimes we had to carry badly wounded soldiers and officers
over a distance of twenty-five miles. The march would commence at
eight in the morning, medicines must be administered on the way, and
we were required to reach the base-hospital at five. This was very
hard work indeed. It was only once that we had to carry the wounded
twenty-five miles in a single day. Again the British army met with
reverse after reverse in the beginning of the war and large numbers
were wounded. The officers therefore were compelled to give up their
idea of not taking us within the firing line. But it must be stated
that when such an emergency arose we were told that as the terms of
our contract included immunity from such service, General Buller had
no intention of forcing us to work under fire if we were not prepared
to accept such risk, but if we undertook it voluntarily, it would be
greatly appreciated. We were only too willing to enter thedanger zone
and had never liked to remain outside. We therefore welcomed this
opportunity. But none of us received a bullet wound or any other
injury.</p>

comparatively insignificant. They suffered hardly any loss of  life.

Before closing this chapter, I must place a noteworthy incident on
record. Among those who were in Ladysmith when it was invested by the
Boers, there were besides Englishmen a few stray Indian settlers.
Some of these were traders, while the rest were indentured labourers,
working on the railways or as servants  to  English gentlemen. One of
whom was Parbhusingh. The officer in command at Ladysmith assigned
various duties to every resident of the place. The most dangerous and
most responsible work wasassigned to Parbhusingh who was a ‘coolie’.
On a hill near Ladysmith the Boers had stationed a pom-pom, whose
operations destroyed  many buildings and even occasioned some loss of
life. An interval of a minute or two must pass before a shell which
had been fired from the gun reached a distantobjective. If the
besieged got even such a short notice, they could take cover before
the shell dropped in the town and thus save themselves. Parbhusingh
was to sit perched up in a tree, all the time that the gun was
working, with his eyes fixed on the hill and to ring a bell the
moment he observed a flash. On hearing the bell, the residents of
Ladysmith instantly took cover and saved  themselves from the deadly
cannon ball whose approach was thus announced.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
The officer in charge of Ladysmith, in eulogizing the invaluable
services rendered by Parbhusingh, stated that he worked so zealously
that not once had he failed to ring the bell. It need hardly be said
that his own life was constantly in peril. The story of his bravery
came to</p>

be known in Natal and at last reached the ears of Lord Curzon, then
Viceroy of India, who sent a Kashmir robe for presentation to
Parbhusingh and wrote to the Natal Government, asking them to carry
out the presentation ceremony with all possible publicity. This duty
was assigned to the Mayor of Durban who held a public meeting in the
Town Hall for the purpose. This incident has a twofold lesson for us.
First, we should not despise any man, however humble or
insignificant-looking  he  may  be.  Secondly,  no  matter  how  
timid  a man is, he is capable of the loftiest heroism when he is put
to the test.</p>

I had stayed there six years instead of one month as originally
intended. The outlines  of the  work  before  us  were  fairly 
fixed. Still  I  could  not leave  South  Africa  without  the 
willing  consent  of the Indian community. I informed my colleagues
that I intended taking up public work in India. I had learnt in South
Africa the lesson of service instead of self-interest, and was
longing for opportunities of such work. Shri Mansukhlal Nazar was
there and so was Mr. Khan. Some Indian youths born and bred in South
Africa had returned from England as barristers. In these
circumstances it would not be improper if I returned to India. When I
had urged all these arguments, I was permitted to return only on the
condition that if an unexpected situation arose in South Africa 
requiring  my presence there, the community might recall me any day
and I should at once go back. They undertook in such a case to bear
my travelling expenses and the expenses incurred during my stay in
South Africa. I agreed to this arrangement and returned to India.</p>

sufficed for my necessities. But peace was never to be my portion in
this life. I had been in Bombay hardly three or four months when I

situation there was serious, that Mr. Chamberlain was expected
shortly, and that my presence was necessary.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

I wound up my Bombay office and house and started for South Africa by
the first available steamer. This was near the end of 1902. I had
returned to India towards the close of 1901 and had opened my office
at Bombay about March 1902. The cablegram did not contain full
details. I guessed that there was trouble in the Transvaal. But I
went to South Africa without my family as I thought I would be able
to return to India in four or six months. I was however simply amazed
when I reached Durban and heard everything. Many of us had hoped that
the position of Indians throughout South Africa would improve after
the war. We did not anticipate trouble in the Transvaal and the Free
State at any rate, as Lord Lansdowne, Lord Selborne and other high
functionaries had declared when the war brokeoutthat the treatment
accorded to the Indians by the Boers was one of the causes of the
war. The British Agent at Pretoria hadoften told me that if the
Transvaal became a British Colonyall the grievances under which the
Indians laboured would be instantly redressed. The Europeans too
believed that as the Transvaal was now under the British flag, the
old laws of the Boer republic directed against the Indians could not
be enforced. This principle was so widely accepted that the
auctioneers who before the war did not accept bids from Indians for
the purchase of land now openly accepted such bids. Many Indians thus
purchased lands at public auctions, but when they tendered the deeds
of transfer to the revenue officer for registration, the officer in
charge refused to register the deeds quoting Act 3 of 1885! All this
I learnt on landing at Durban. The leaders said that Mr. Chamberlain
would first come to Durban and we must first acquaint him with the
situation in Natal. This done, I was to follow him to the Transvaal.</p>

As the reader is aware, any Indian could at any time enter the
Transvaal before the war. I observed that this was not the case now
any longer. The restrictions, however, equally applied to
all—Europeans as well as Indians. The condition of the country was
still such that if a large number of people entered the Transvaal all
at once, there would not be sufficient food and clothing to go round,
as all the shops had not reopened after the war. The goods stocked in
the shops had been unceremoniously appropriated by the late Boer
Government. I therefore thought that, if the restrictions were only
temporary, there was no reason for apprehension. But then there was a
difference in the procedure by which a European and an Indian could
obtain a permit, and this afforded ground for misgiving and alarm.
Permit offices were opened in the various ports of South Africa. For
all practical purposes  a European could obtain a permit for the mere
 asking,  while  an Asiatic Department was created in the Transvaal
for dealing with Indians. The creation of this special department was
a new departure. Indians were required to apply to the head of that
department in the first instance. After he had granted their
applications, they could generally obtain permits at Durban or any
other port.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 102%">
If I had to go through all these formalities, there was no hope of my
getting a permit before Mr. Chamberlain left the Transvaal. The
Indians in the Transvaal could not procure a permit for me. It was
more than they could do. They had therefore relied upon  my
connections in Durban for obtaining a permit for me. I did not know
the permit officer, but as I knew the Police Superintendent of
Durban,  I asked him to accompany me to the permit office. He
consented and gave the necessary assurances. I obtained a permit on
the strength of the fact that I had stayed in the Transvaal for a
year in 1893 and thus reached Pretoria.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
The atmosphere in Pretoria was decidedly ominous. I could see that
the Asiatic Department was merely a frightful engine of oppression
for the Indians. The officers in charge were some of the adventurers
who had accompanied the army from India to South Africa during the
war and had settled there in order to try their luck. Some of them
were corrupt. Two officers were even prosecuted for bribery. The jury
declared them not guilty, but as really there was no</p>

doubt entertained as to their guilt, they were subsequently dismissed
from service. Partiality was the order of the day. When a separate
department is thus created and when restricting existing rights is
the sole reason for its existence, officers are naturally inclined to
devise fresh restrictions from time to time in order to justify their
existence and in order to show that they are efficient in the

I saw that I had to begin my work from the very beginning. The
Asiatic Department could not at once make out how I had managed to
enter the Transvaal. They did not venture to ask me  directly.  I 
imagine they thought me above smuggling myself into the country. They
indirectly obtained information as to how I had  secured  a permit. A
deputation from Pretoria prepared to wait upon Mr. Chamberlain. I
drafted the memorial<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>for
submission to him but the Asiatic Department excluded me from the
deputation. It appeared to the Indian leaders that they should not
see Mr. Chamberlain if I was prevented from going with them. But I
did not countenance this idea.  I said that I should not mind the
insult to me and advised them to ignore it too. The memorial was
there and it was essential that it should be presented to Mr.
Chamberlain. Mr. George Godfrey, an Indian barrister, who was present
at the time, was charged with the task of reading the memorial. The
deputation waited upon Mr. Chamberlain. My name being mentioned in
course of the interview, he said, “I have already seen Mr. Gandhi
in Durban. I therefore refused to see him here, in order that I might
learn about the situation in the Transvaal at first hand from local
residents.” In my view this remark only added fuel to the fire. Mr.
Chamberlain spoke out as he had been tutored by the Asiatic
Department, which  thus  tried  to import into the Transvaal the
atmosphere which pervades India. Everyone knows how British officers
consider Bombay men as foreigners in, say, Champaran. At that rate
how could I who lived in Durban know anything about the situation in
the Transvaal? Thus did the Asiatic Department coach Mr. Chamberlain.
Little did he know that I had lived in the Transvaal, and that even
if I had not, I was fully conversant with the Indian situation there.
There was only  one pertinent question in the present case: Who
possessed the best knowledge of the situation in the Transvaal? The
Indians had already answered it for themselves by asking me to go
there all the way from India. But it is no new experience to find
that arguments based on reason do not always appeal to men in
authority. Mr. Chamberlain was then so much under the influence of
the men on the spot and so</p>

anxious was he to humour the Europeans that there was little or no
hope of his doing us justice. Still the deputation waited upon him,

omitted whether by oversight or through a sense of wounded
self-respect.</p>

I was now confronted by a dilemma even more difficult than the one
which faced me in 1894. From one standpoint, it seemed I could return
to India as soon as Mr. Chamberlain left South Africa. On the other
hand I could clearly see that, if I returned with the vain fancy of
serving on a larger field in India while I was fully aware of the
great danger which stared the South African Indians in the face, the
spirit of service which I had acquired would be stultified. I thought
that even if that meant living in South Africa all my life, I must
remain there until the gathering clouds were dispersed or until they
broke upon and swept us all away, all our counteracting efforts
notwithstanding. This is how I spoke to the Indian leaders. Now, as
in 1894, I declared my intention to maintain myself by legal
practice. As for the community, this was precisely what they wanted.</p>

I soon applied for admission to practise in the Transvaal. There was
some apprehension that the Law Society here too would oppose my
application, but it proved groundless. I was enrolled as an attorney
of the Supreme Court, and opened an office in Johannesburg. Of all
places in the Transvaal, Johannesburg had the largest population of
Indians and was therefore well suited for me to settle in, from the
standpoint of public work as well as of my own maintenance. I was
daily gaining bitter experience of the corruptness of the Asiatic
Department, and the best efforts of the Transvaal British Indian
Association were directed to finding a remedy for this disease. The
repeal of Act 3 of 1885 now receded into the background as a distant
objective. The immediate aim was limited to saving ourselves from the
onrushing flood in the shape of this Asiatic Department. Indian
deputations waited upon Lord Milner,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

Lawley who was the Lieutenant Governor of the Transvaal and who
subsequently became Governor of Madras, and upon officers of lesser
dignity. I often used to see Government officers. We obtained some
slight relief here and there, but it was all patchwork. We used to
receive some such satisfaction as is</p>

experienced by a man who has been deprived of his all by robbers and
who by beseeching the robbers induces them to return something of
very small value. It was in consequence of this agitation that the
officers whose dismissal I have referred to above were prosecuted.
Our misgivings as regards the restrictions on Indian immigration
proved correct. Permits were no longer required from Europeans, while
they continued to be demanded from Indians. The late Boer Government
never strictly enforced their drastic anti-Asiatic legislation not
because they were generous but because their administration was lax.
A good officer has not under the British Government as much scope for
the exercise of his goodness as he had under the Boer regime. The
British Constitution is old and stereotyped, and officers under it
have to work like machines. Their liberty of action is restricted by
a system of progressive checks. Under the British Constitution,
therefore, if the policy of the Government is liberal, the subjects
receive the utmost advantage of its liberality. On the other hand, if
their policy is oppressive or niggardly, the subjects feel the
maximum weight of their heavy hand. The reverse is the case under
constitutions such as that of the late Boer republic. Whether or not
the subjectsreap full advantage from a liberal law largely
dependsupon the officers who are charged with its administration.
Thus, when British power was established in the Transvaal, all laws
adversely affecting the Indians began to be more and more strictly
enforced day by day. Loopholes, wherever they existed, were carefully
closed. We have already seen that the Asiatic Department was bound to
be harsh in its operations. The repeal of the old laws was therefore
out of the question. It only remained for the Indians to try and see
how their rigours might  be  mitigated  in practice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
One principle must be discussed sooner or later, and if  we  discuss
it at this stage, it will perhaps facilitate an understanding of the
Indian point of view and of the situation as it developed hereafter.
Soon after the establishment of British rule in the Transvaal and the
Free State, Lord Milner appointed a committee whose terms of
reference were to prepare a list of such of the old laws of both the
republics as placed restrictions on the liberty of the subject or
were opposed to the spirit of the British Constitution. The
anti-Indian laws could clearly have been included in this
description. But Lord Milner’s object in appointing the committee
was not to redress the grievances of Indians but those of Britishers.
He wanted to repeal at the earliest opportunity those laws which
indirectly pressed hard upon</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Britishers. The committee submitted their report in a very short
time, and many acts, large and small, which affected Britishers
prejudicially, were, it can be said, repealed by a stroke of the pen.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The same committee  prepared  a  list  of anti-Indian acts. These
were published in the form of a book which served as a handy manual
easily used or from our standpoint abused by the Asiatic Department.
Now, if the anti-Indian laws did not mention the Indians by name and
were not thus made expressly applicable to them alone but to all
subjects, and if their enforcement had been left to the discretion of
administrators, or had the laws imposed general restrictions which
could have been enforced against Indians in a specially rigorous
manner, the object of the legislators would all the same have been
achieved by such laws, and yet the laws would have been general laws.
None would have felt insulted by their enactment, and when the
existing bitterness was softened by time, there would be no need to
modify the laws, but only a more liberal administration of the laws
would have sufficed to relieve the aggrieved community. Just as I
have called laws of the second kind general laws, those of the first
kind can be described as particular or racial, and establish what is
known as the ‘colour bar’, as on the specific ground of colour
they impose greater restrictions on members of the dark or brown
races than on Europeans.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
To take one instance from the laws which were already in force. The
reader will remember that the first disfranchising Act which was
enacted in Natal but was subsequently disallowed by the Imperial
Government provided for the disqualification as voters of all
Asiatics as such. Now if such a law were to be altered, public
opinion should be so far educated that the majority be not only not
hostile  but  actually friendly to Asiatics. The colour bar it set up
could only be removed when such cordial feelings were established.
This is an illustration of racial or class legislation. The Act
referred to was withdrawn and a second Act was enacted in its place
which nearly achieved an identical object yet was of a general
nature, the sting of racial distinction being removed. The substance
of one of its clauses is as follows: ‘No person can be placed on
the voters’ roll in Natal who is a native of countries which have
not hitherto possessed elective representative institutions based on
the parliamentary franchise.’ No reference is made here to Indians
or Asiatics. The opinions of counsel could differ as to whether or
not India possesses representative institutions based on the
parliamentary franchise. But assuming for</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
the sake of argument that India did not in 1894 and does not even now
enjoy the parliamentary franchise, no one can say off hand that the
officer in charge of voters’ lists in Natal has done an illegal act
if he includes the names of Indians in the lists. There is always a
general presumption in favour of the right of the subject. So long
therefore as the government of the day does not become positively
hostile, the names of Indians and others could be included in the
electoral roll, the above law notwithstanding. That is to say, if the
dislike for Indians became less marked and if the local Government
was unwilling to injure the Indians, their names could be entered in
the voters’ lists without the slightest modification of the law.
This is the advantage of a general law. Other instances of the same
kind can be cited  from among the laws in force in South Africa which
have been referred to in previous chapters. The wise policy,
therefore, is to enact as little class legislation as possible; and
it would be wiser still to avoid it altogether. Once a law is
enacted, many difficulties must be encountered before it can be
reversed. It is only when public opinion is highly educated that the
laws in force in a country can be repealed. A constitution under
which laws are modified or repealed every now and then cannot be said
to be stable or well organized.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
We can now better appreciate the poison which was present in the
anti-Asiatic laws in the Transvaal. They were all racial in
character. The Asiatics as such could not vote; nor could they own
land outside the locations set apart for them by the Government.  The
 administrators could do nothing for the Indians so long as these
laws were not removed from the statute-book. Lord Milner’s
committee could make a separate list of such laws only as were not
general in character. Had they been general laws, all laws, enforced
only against the Asiatics though not expressly directed against them,
would have been repealed along with the rest. The officers in charge
could never have argued their helplessness and said that they had no
alternative but to enforce the laws so long as the new legislature
did not abrogate them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
When these laws passed into the hands of the Asiatic Department, it
began to enforce them strictly. If the laws were at all worthy of
being enforced, Government must arm itself with further powers in
order to close the loopholes intentionally kept or left by
inadvertence in favour of Asiatics. This looks quite simple and
straight. Either the laws are bad in which case they should be
repealed, or they are proper in which case their deficiencies should
be</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
remedied. The ministers had adopted the policy of enforcing the laws.
The Indians had stood shoulder to shoulder with the British and
risked their lives during the late war, but that was now a story
three or four years old. The British Agent at Pretoria had put up a
fight on behalf of the Indians, but that was during the old regime.
The grievances of the Indians figured as one of the declared causes
of the war, but that declaration was made by short-sighted statesmen
who had no knowledge of local conditions. The local officials clearly
observed that the anti-Asiatic laws enacted by the late Boer
Government were neither adequately severe nor systematic. If the
Indians could enter the Transvaal at will and carry on trade wherever
they chose, British traders would suffer great loss. All these and
similar arguments carried greater weight with the Europeans and their
representatives in the ministry. They were all out to amass the
maximum of wealth in the minimum of time; how could they stand the
Indians becoming co-sharers with them? Hypocrisy pressed political
theory into service in order to make out a plausible case. A
barefaced selfish or  mercantile argument would not satisfy the
intelligent Europeans of South Africa. The human intellect delights
in inventing specious arguments in order to support injustice itself,
and the South African Europeans were no exception to this general
rule. These were the arguments advanced by General Smuts and others:</p>

“South Africa is a representative of Western civilization while
India is the centre of Oriental culture. Thinkers of the present
generation hold that these two civilizations cannot go together. If
nations representing these rival cultures meet even in small groups,
the result will only be an explosion. The West is opposed to
simplicity, while Orientals consider that virtue to be of primary
importance. How can these opposite views be reconciled? It is not the
business of statesmen, practical men as they are, to adjudicate upon
their relative merits. Western civilization may or may not be good,
but Westerners wish to stick to it. They have made tireless
endeavours to save that civilization. They have shed rivers of blood
for its sake. They have suffered great hardships in its cause. It is
therefore too late for them now to chalk out a new path for
themselves. Thus considered, the Indian question cannot be resolved
into one of trade jealousy or race hatred. The problem is simply one
of preserving one’s  own civilization, that is of enjoying the
supreme right of self-preservation and discharging the corresponding
duty. Some public speakers may like to inflame the Europeans by
finding fault with Indians, but</p>

political thinkers believe and say that the very qualities of Indians
count for defects in South Africa. The Indians are disliked in South
Africa for their simplicity, patience, perserverance, frugality and
otherworldliness. Westerners are enterprising, impatient, engrossed
in multiplying their material wants and in satisfying them, fond of
good cheer, anxious to save physical labour and prodigal in habits.
They are therefore afraid that if thousands of Orientals settled in
South Africa, the Westerners must go to the wall. Westerners in South
Africa are not prepared to commit suicide and their leaders will not
permit them to be reduced to such straits.”</p>

I believe I have impartially recapitulated the arguments urged by men
of the highest character among the Europeans. I have characterized
their arguments as pseudo-philosophical, but I do not thereby wish to
suggest that they are groundless. From a practical point of view,
that is to say, from the standpoint of immediate self-interest, they
have much force. But from the philosophical point of view, they are
hypocrisy pure and simple. In my humble opinion, no impartial person
could accept such conclusions and no reformer would place his
civilization in the position of helplessness in which those who urge
these arguments have placed theirs. So far as I am aware, no Eastern
thinker fears that if Western nations came in free contact with
Orientals, Oriental culture would be swept away like sand by the
onrushing tide of Western civilization. So far as I have a grasp of
Eastern thought, it seems to me that Oriental civilization not only
does not fear but would positively welcome free contact with Western
civilization. If contrary instances can be met with in the East, they
do not affect the principle I have laid down, for a number of
illustrations can be cited in its support. However that may be,
Western thinkers claim that the foundation of Western civilization is
the predominance of might over right. Therefore it is that the
protagonists of that civilization devote most of their time to the
conservation of brute force. These thinkers likewise assert that the
nations which do not increase their material wants are doomed to
destruction. It is in pursuance of these principles that Western
nations have settled  in  South Africa and subdued the numerically
overwhelmingly superior races of South Africa. It is absurd to
imagine that they would fear the harmless population of India. The
best proof of the statement that the Europeans have nothing to fear
from the Asiatics is provided by the fact that had the Indians
continued to work in South Africa for all time as mere labourers, no
agitation would have been started against</p>

The only remaining factors are trade and colour. Thousands of
Europeans have admitted in their writings that trade by Indians hits
petty British traders hard, and that the dislike of the brown races
has at present become part and parcel of the mentality of Europeans.
Even in the United States of America, where the principle of
statutory equality has been established, a man like Booker T.
Washington<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

Christian  of high character and has fully assimilated Western
civilization, was not considered fit for admission to the court of
President Roosevelt and probably would not be so considered even
today! The Negroes of the United States have accepted Western
civilization. They have embraced Christianity. But the black pigment
of their  skin  constitutes  their crime, and if in the Northern
States they are socially despised, they are lynched<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

The  reader  will  thus  see  that  there  is  not   much   substance
in the ‘philosophical’ arguments discussed above. But he must not
therefore conclude that all those who urge them do so in a 
hypocritical spirit. Many of them honestly hold these views to be
sound. It is possible that if we were placed in their position, we
too would advance similar arguments. We have a saying in India that
as is a man’s conduct such is his understanding. Who is there but
has observed that our arguments are but a reflection of our
mentality, and that if they do not commend themselves to others, we
become dissatisfied, impatient and even indignant?</p>

To resume our narrative. We have seen that the British administrators
decided to prevent fresh Indian immigrants from entering the
Transvaal, and to render the position of the old Indian settlers so
uncomfortable that they would feel compelled to leave the country in
sheer disgust, and even if they did not leave it, they would be
reduced to a state bordering on serfdom. Some men looked upon as
great statesmen in South Africa had declared more than once that they
could afford to keep the Indians only as hewers of wood and drawers
of water. On the staff of the Asiatic Department was, among others,
Mr. Lionel Curtis, who is now known to fame as the missionary for
diarchy in India. This young man, as he then was,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>enjoyed
the confidence of Lord Milner. He claimed to do everything according
to scientific method, but he was capable of committing serious
blunders. The Municipality of Johannesburg had suffered a loss of
£14,000 in consequence of one such blunder committed by him. He
suggested that if fresh Indian immigration was to be stopped, the
first step to be taken to that end was the effective registration of
the old Indian residents in South Africa. That done, no one could
smuggle himself into the country by practising personation, and if
anyone did,  he could be easily detected. The permits which were
issued to Indians after the establishment of British rule in the
Transvaal contained the signature of the holder or his
thumb-impression if he was illiterate. Later on someone suggested the
inclusion, besides, of a photograph of the holder, and this
suggestion was carried out by administrative action, legislation
being unnecessary. The Indian leaders therefore did not come to know
of this innovation at once. When, in course of time, these novel
features came to their notice, they sent memorials to the
authorities, and waited upon them in deputations on behalf of the
community. The official argument was that Government could not permit
Indians to enter the country without regulation of some sort, and
that therefore all Indians should provide themselves with uniform
permits containing such details as might render it impossible for</p>

anyone but the rightful holders to enter the country. It was  my 
opinion that although we were not bound by law to take out such
permits, the Government could insist on requiring them so long as the
Peace Preservation Ordinance was in force. The Peace Preservation
Ordinance in South Africa was something like the Defence of India Act
in India. Just as the Defence of India Act was kept on the
statute-book in India longer than necessary in order to harass the
people, so was this ordinance allowed to remain in force long after
the necessity for it had passed in order to harass Indians in South
Africa. As for the Europeans, it was a dead letter for all practical
purposes. Now if permits must be taken out, they should contain some
mark of identification. There was nothing wrong therefore that those
who were illiterate should allow their thumb-impression to be taken.

The final upshot of the negotiations between the Indian community and
the authorities was that the Indians consented to change their
permits for new ones and agreed that fresh Indian immigrants should
take out permits in the new form. Although the Indians were not bound
in law, they voluntarily agreed to  reregistration in the hope that
new restrictions might not be imposed upon them, it might be clear to
all concerned that the Indians did not wish to bring in fresh
immigrants by unfair means, and the Peace Preservation Ordinance
might no longer be used to harass newcomers. Almost all Indians thus
changed their old permits for new ones. This was no small thing. The
community completed like one man with the greatest promptitude this
re-registration, which they were not legally bound to carry out. This
was a proof  of their veracity, tact, large-mindedness, common sense
and humility. It also showed that the community had no desire to
violate in any way any law in force in the Transvaal. The Indians
believed that if they behaved towards the Government with such
courtesy, it would treat them well, show regard to them and
conferfresh rights upon them. We shall see in the next chapter how
the British Government in the Transvaal rewarded them for this great
act of courtesy.</p>

</font></sup>I had re-entered the Transvaal in 1903 and opened my
office in Johannesburg about the middle of that year. Two years had
thus passed in merely resisting the inroads of the Asiatic
Department. We all expected now that re-registration would satisfy
the Government and confidently looked forward to a period of
comparative peace for the community. But that was not to be. The
reader has been already introduced to Mr. Lionel Curtis. This
gentleman held that the Europeans had not attained their objective
simply because the Indians changed their old permits for new
certificates of registration. It was not enough in his eyes that
great measures were achieved by mutual understanding. He was of
opinion that these should have the force of law behind them, and that
thus only could the principles underlying them be secured for all
time. Mr. Curtis wanted some such restrictions to be placed upon
Indians as would produce a striking impression all over South Africa
and ultimately serve as a model for the other Dominions of the Empire
to imitate. He would not consider the Transvaal to be safe so long as
even a single point in South Africa was open to Indians. Again,
re-registration by mutual consent was calculated to increase the
prestige of the Indian community, while Mr. Curtis was keen upon
lowering it. He would not care to carry Indian opinion with him but
would frighten us into submission to external restrictions backed up
by rigorous legal sanctions. He  therefore  drafted an Asiatic Bill
and advised the Government that so long as his Bill  was  not 
passed,  there  was  no  provision  in  the  laws  already  in force
to prevent the Indians from surreptitiously entering the Transvaal or
to remove  unauthorized  residents  from  the  country. Mr. Curtis’s
arguments met with a ready response from the Government, and a draft
Asiatic Law Amendment Ordinance to be introduced into the Legislative
Council was published in the Transvaal <i>Government</i><i> </i><i>Gazette</i>.</p>

Before dealing with this Ordinance in detail, it would be well to
dispose of an important event in a few words. As I was the author of
the satyagraha movement, it is necessary to enable the reader fully
to understand some events of my life. The Zulu ‘rebellion’ broke
out in Natal just while attempts were thus being made to impose
further disabilities upon Indians in the Transvaal. I doubted then
and doubt even now if the outbreak could be described as a rebellion,
but it has always been thus described in Natal. Now as in the Boer
War, many</p>

European residents of Natal joined the army as volunteers. As I too
was considered a resident of Natal, I thought I must do my bit in the
war. With the community’s permission, therefore, I made an offer<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>to
the Government to raise a Stretcher-bearer Corps for service with the
troops. The offer was accepted. I therefore broke up my  Johannesburg
home and sent my family to Phoenix in Natal where my co-workers had
settled and from where <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>was published, I
did not close the office as I knew I would not be away for long. I
joined the  army  with  a  small  corps  of  twenty  or  twenty-five
men. Most of the provinces of India were represented even on this
small body of men. The corps was on active service for a month. I
have always been thankful to God for the work which then fell to our
lot. We found that the wounded Zulus would have been left uncared
for, if we had not attended to them. No European would help to dress
their wounds. Dr. Savage, who was in charge of  the ambulance, was
himself a very humane person. It was no part of our duty to nurse the
wounded after we had taken them to the hospital. But we had joined
the war with a desire to do all we could, no matter whether  it  did 
or did not fall  within  the   scope   of   our   work. The good
Doctor told us that he could not induce Europeans to nurse the Zulus,
that it was beyond his power to compel them and that he would feel
obliged if we undertook this mission of mercy. We were only too glad
to do this. We had to cleanse the wounds of several Zulus which had
not been attended to for as many as five or six days and were
therefore stinking horribly. We liked the work. The Zulus could not
talk to us, but from their gestures and the expression of their eyes
they seemed to feel as if God had sent us to their succour. The work
for which we had enlisted was fairly heavy, for sometimes during the
month we had to perform a march of as many as forty miles a day.</p>

worked very hard. I cannot just now recall the names of the other
Indians, but I well remember that one of these was a Pathan, who used
to express his astonishment on finding us carrying as large a load
as, and marching abreast of, himself. While I was working with the
Corps, two ideas which had long been floating in my mind became
firmly fixed. First, an aspirant after a life exclusively devoted to
service must lead a life of celibacy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>Second, he must accept poverty as a constant companion
through life. He may not take up any occupation which would prevent
him or make him shrink from undertaking the lowliest of duties or
largest risks. Letters and telegrams, asking me to proceed to the
Transvaal at once, had poured in even while I was serving with the
Corps. On return from the war, therefore, I just met the friends at
Phoenix and at once reached Johannesburg. There I read the draft
Ordinance referred to above. I took the Transvaal <i>Government
Gazette </i><i>Extraordinary </i>of August 22, 1906 in which the
Ordinance was published, home from the office. I went up a hill near
the house in the company of a friend and began to translate the draft
Ordinance into Gujarati for <i>Indian Opinion</i>. I shuddered as I
read the sections of the Ordinance one after another. I saw nothing
in it except hatred of Indians. It seemed to me that if the Ordinance
was passed and the Indians meekly accepted it, that would spell
absolute ruin for the Indians in South Africa. I clearly saw that
this was a question of life and death for them. I further saw that
even in the case of memorials and representations proving fruitless,
the community must not sit with folded hands. Better die than submit
to such a law. But how were we to die? What should we dare and do so
that there would be nothing before us except a choice of victory or
death? An impenetrable wall was before me, as it were, and I could
not see my way through it. I must acquaint the reader with the
details of the proposed measure, which shocked me so violently. Here
is a brief summary of it:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Every Indian, man, woman or child of eight years or upwards, entitled
to reside in the Transvaal, must register his or her name with the
Registrar of Asiatics and take out a certificate of registration. The
applicants for registration must surrender their old permits to the
Registrar and state in their applications their name, residence,
caste, age, etc. The Registrar was to note down important marks of
identification upon the applicant’s person, and take his  finger

thumb impressions. Every Indian who failed thus to apply for
registration before a certain date was to forfeit his right of
residence in the Transvaal. Failure to apply would be held to be an
offence in law for which the defaulter could be fined, sent to prison
or even deported within the discretion of the court. Parents must
apply on behalf of their minor children and bring them to the
Registrar in order to give their finger impressions, etc. In case of
parents failing to discharge this responsibility laid upon them, the
minor on attaining the age of sixteen years must discharge it
himself, and if he defaulted, he made himself liable to the same
punishments as could be awarded to his parents. The certificate of
registration issued to an applicant must be produced before any
police officer whenever and wherever he might be required to do so.
Failure thus to produce the certificate would be held to be an
offence for which the defaulter could be fined or sent to prison.
Even a person walking on public thoroughfares could be required to
produce his certificate. Police officers could enter private houses
in order to inspect certificates. Indians entering the Transvaal from
some place outside it must produce their certificates before the
inspector on duty. Certificates must be produced on demand in courts
which the holder attended on business, and in revenue offices which
issued to him a trading or bicycle licence. That is to say, if an
Indian wanted any Government office to do for him something within
its competence, the officer could ask to see his certificate before
granting his request. Refusal to produce the certificate or to supply
such particulars or means of identification as might be prescribed by
regulation would also be held to be an offence for which the person
refusing could be fined or sent to prison.</p>

I have never known legislation of this nature being directed against
free men in any part of the world. I know that indentured Indians in
Natal are subject to a drastic system of passes, but these poor
fellows can hardly be classed as free men. However, even the laws to
which they are subject are mild in comparison  to  the Ordinance
outlined above and the penalties they impose are a mere fleabite when
compared with the penalties laid down in the Ordinance.</p>

A trader with assets running into lakhs could be deported and thus
faced with utter ruin in virtue of the Ordinance. And the patient

some of its provisions. There are some drastic laws directed against

compared and will be  found not to  suffer by  the comparison. The</p>

giving of<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>finger
prints, required by the Ordinance, was quite a novelty in South
Africa. With a view to seeing some literature on the subject, I read
a volume on finger impressions by Mr. Henry, a police officer, from
which I gathered that finger prints were required by law only from  
criminals.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2       </font></sup>I
  was   therefore   shocked   by   this   compulsory requirement

Ordinance.</p>

The next day there was held a small meeting of leading Indians to
whom I explained the Ordinance word by word. It shocked them as it
had shocked me. One of them said in a fit of passion: “If anyone
came forward to demand a certificate from my wife, I would shoot him
on the spot and take the consequences.” I quieted him, and
addressing the meeting said: “This is a very serious crisis. If the
Ordinance were passed and if we acquiesced in it, it would be
imitated all over South Africa. As it seems to me, it is designed to
strike at the very root of our existence in South Africa. It is not
the last step, but the first step with a view to hounding us out of
the country. We are therefore responsible for the safety, not only of
the ten or fifteen thou sand Indians in the Transvaal but of the
entire Indian community in South Africa. Again, if we fully
understand all the implications of this legislation, we shall find
that India’s honour is in our keeping. For the Ordinance seeks to
humiliate not only ourselves but also the motherland. The humiliation
consists in the degradation of innocent men. No one will take it upon
himself to say that we have done anything to deserve such
legislation. We are innocent, and insult offered to a single innocent
member of a nation is tantamount to insulting the nation as a whole.
It will not, therefore, do to be hasty, impatient or angry. That
cannot save us from this onslaught. But God will come to our help if
we calmly think out and carry out in time measures of resistance,
presenting a united front and bearing the hardships  which  such 
resistance  brings  in   its  train.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3

The meeting was duly held on September 11, 1906. It was attended by
delegates from various places in the Transvaal. But I must confess
that even I myself had not then  understood  all  the implications of
the resolutions I had helped to frame;  nor  had  I gauged all the
possible conclusions to which they might lead. The old Empire Theatre
was packed from floor to ceiling. I could read in every face the
expectation of something strange to be done or to happen. Mr. Abdul
Gani, Chairman of the Transvaal British Indian Association, presided.
He was one of the oldest Indian residents of the Transvaal, and
partner and manager of the Johannesburg branch of the   well-known  
firm   of   Mamad   Kasam   Kamrudin<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

its becoming law in the teeth of their opposition and to suffer all
the penalties attaching to such non-submission.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup></p>

I  fully explained this  resolution to  the   meeting   and received
a patient hearing. The business of the meeting was conducted in Hindi
or  Gujarati;  it  was  impossible  therefore  that  anyone present
should not follow the proceedings. For the Tamils  and  Telugus who
did not know Hindi there were Tamil and Telugu speakers who fully
explained everything in their respective languages. The resolution
was duly proposed, seconded and supported by several speakers one of
whom was Sheth Haji Habib. He too was a very old and experienced
resident of South Africa and made an impassioned speech. He was
deeply moved and went so far as to say that we must pass this
resolution with God as witness and must never yield a cowardly
submission to such degrading legislation. He then went on solemnly to
declare in the name of God that he would never submit to that law,
and advised all present to do likewise.</p>

Others also delivered powerful and  angry  speeches  in supporting
the resolution. When in the course of his speech Sheth Haji Habib
came to the solemn declaration, I was at once startled and put on my
guard. Only then did I fully realize my own responsibility and the
responsibility of the community. The community  had  passed many a
resolution before and amended such resolutions in the light of
further reflection or fresh experience. There were cases in which
resolutions passed had not been observed by all concerned. Amendments
inresolutions and failure to observe resolutions on the part of
persons agreeing thereto are ordinary experiences of public life all
the world over. But no one ever imports the name of God into such
resolutions. In the abstract there should not be any distinction
between a resolution and an oath taken in the name of God. When an
intelligent man makes a resolution deliberately he never swerves from
it by a hair’s breadth. With him his resolution carries as much
weight as a declaration made with God as witness does. But the world
takes no note of abstract principles and imagines an ordinary
resolution and an oath in the name of God to be poles asunder. A man
who makes an ordinary resolution is not ashamed of himself when he
deviates from it, but a man who violates an oath administered to him
is not only ashamed of himself but is also looked upon by society as
a sinner. This imaginary distinction has struck such a deep root in
the human mind that a person making a statement on oath before a
judge is held to have committed an offence in law if the statement is
proved to be false and receives drastic punishment.</p>

by Sheth Haji Habib’s suggestion of an oath. I thought out the
possible consequences of  it  in  a  moment.  My  perplexity gave
place to enthusiasm. And although  I  had  no  intention  of  taking
an oath or inviting others to do so, when I went to the meeting I
warmly approved of the Sheth’s suggestion. But at the same time it
seemed to me that the people should be told of all the consequences
and should have explained to them clearly the meaning of a pledge.
And if even then they were prepared to pledge  themselves,  they
should be encouraged to do so; otherwise, I must understand that they
were not still ready to stand the final test. I therefore asked the
President for permission to explain to the meeting the implications
of Sheth Haji Habib’s suggestion. The President readily granted it
and I rose to address the meeting. I give below a summary of my
remarks</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
just as I can recall them now:</p>

“I wish to explain to this meeting that there is a vast difference
between this resolution and every other resolution we have passed up
to date and that there is a wide divergence also in the manner of
making it. It is a very grave resolution we are making, as our
existence in South Africa depends upon our fully observing it. The
manner of making the resolution suggested by our friend is as much of
a novelty as of a solemnity. I did not come to the meeting with a
view to getting the resolution passed in that manner, which redounds
to the credit of Sheth Haji Habib as well as it lays a burden of
responsibility upon him. I tender my congratulations to him. I deeply
appreciate his suggestion, but if you adopt it you too will share his
responsibility. You must understand what is this responsibility, and
as an adviser and servant of the community, it is my duty fully to
explain it to you.</p>

“We all believe in one and the same God, the differences of
nomenclature in Hinduism and Islam notwithstanding. To pledge
ourselves or to take an oath in the name of that God or with Him as
witness is not something to be trifled with. If having taken such an
oath we violate our pledge we are guilty before God and man.
Personally I hold that a man who deliberately and intelligently takes
a pledge and then breaks it forfeits his manhood. And just as a
copper coin treated with mercury not only becomes valueless when
detected but also makes its owner liable to punishment, in the same
way a man who lightly pledges his word and then breaks it becomes a
man of straw and fits himself for punishment here as well as
hereafter. Sheth Haji Habib is proposing to administer an oath of a
very serious character. There is no one in this meeting who can be
classed as an infant or as wanting in understanding. You are all well
advanced in age and have seen the world; many of you are delegates
and have discharged responsibilities in a greater or lesser measure.
No one present, therefore, can ever hope to excuse himself by saying
that he did not know what he was about when he took the oath.</p>

“I know that pledges and vows are, and should be, taken on rare
occasions. A man who takes a vow every now and then is sure to
stumble. But if I can imagine a crisis in the history of the Indian
community of South Africa when it would be in the fitness of things
to take pledges, that crisis is surely now. There is wisdom in taking
serious steps with great caution and hesitation. But caution and
hesitation have their limits, and we have now passed them. The
Government has taken leave of all sense of decency. We would only</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 95%; page-break-before: always">
be betraying our unworthiness and cowardice, if we cannot stake our
all in the face of the conflagration which envelopes us and sit
watching it with folded hands. There is no doubt, therefore, that the
present is a proper occasion for taking pledges. But every one of us
must think out for himself if he has the will and the ability to
pledge himself. Resolutions of this nature cannot be passed by a
majority vote. Only those who take a pledge can be bound by it. This
pledge must not be taken with a view to producing an effect on
outsiders. No one should trouble to consider what impression it might
have upon the Local Government, the Imperial Government, or the
Government of India. Everyone must only search his own heart, and if
the inner voice assures him that he has the requisite strength to
carry himthrough, then only should he pledge himself and then only
will his pledge bear fruit.</p>

“A few words now as to the consequences. Hoping for the best, we
may say that if a majority of the Indians pledge themselves to
resistance and if all who take the pledge prove true to themselves,
the Ordinance may not be passed and, if passed, may be soon repealed.
It may be that we may not be called upon to suffer at all. But if on
the one hand a man who takes a pledge must be a robust optimist, on
the other hand he must be prepared for the worst. Therefore I want to
give you an idea of the worst that might happen to us in the present
struggle. Imagine that all of us present here numbering 3,000 at the
most pledge ourselves. Imagine again that the remaining 10,000
Indians take no such pledge. We will only provoke ridicule in the
beginning. Again, it is quite possible that in spite of the present 
warning some or many of those who pledge themselves may weaken at the
very first trial. We may have to go to jail, where we may be
insulted. We may have to go hungry and suffer extreme heat or cold.
Hard labour may be imposed upon us. We may be flogged by rude
warders. We may be fined heavily and our property may be attached and
held up to  auction if  there are  only  a  few  resisters  left.
Opulent today, we may be reduced to abject poverty tomorrow.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.07cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
We may be deported. Suffering from starvation and similar hardships
in jail, some of us may fall ill and even die. In short, therefore,
it is not at all impossible that we may have to endure every hardship
that we can imagine, and wisdom lies in pledging ourselves on the
understanding that we shall have to suffer all that and worse. If
someone asks me when and how the struggle may end, I may say that if
the entire community manfully stands the test, the end will be near.
If many of us fall back under storm and stress, the struggle will be</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
prolonged. But I can boldly declare, and with certainty, that so long
as there is even a handful of men true to their pledge, there can
only be one end to the struggle, and that is victory.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 95%">
“A word about my personal responsibility. If I am warning you of
the risks attendant upon the pledge, I am at the same time inviting
you to pledge yourselves, and I am fully conscious of my
responsibility in the matter. It is possible that a majority of those
present here may take the pledge in a fit of enthusiasm or
indignation but may weaken under the ordeal, and only a handful may
be left to face the final test. Even then there is only one course
open  to  someone like me, to die but not to submit to the law. It is
quite unlikely but even if everyone else flinched leaving me alone to
face the music, I am confident that I would never violate my pledge.
Please do not misunderstand me. I am not saying this out of vanity,
but I wish to put you, especially the leaders upon the platform, on
your guard. I wish respectfully to suggest it to you that if you have
not the will or the ability to stand firm even when you are perfectly
isolated, you must not only not take the pledge yourselves but  you 
must declare your opposition before the resolution is put to the
meeting and before its members begin to take pledges and you must not
make yourselves parties to the resolution. Although we are going to
take the pledge in a body, no one should imagine that default on the
part of one or many can absolve the rest from their obligation.
Everyone should fully realize his responsibility, then only pledge
himself independently of others and understand that he himself must
be true to his pledge even unto death, no matter what others do.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

I spoke to this effect and  resumed  my seat.  The  meeting  heard me
word by word in perfect quiet. Other leaders too spoke. All dwelt
upon their own responsibility and the responsibility of the audience.
The President rose. He too made the situation clear, and at last all
present, standing with upraised hands, took an oath with God as
witness not to submit to the Ordinance if it became law. I can never
forget the scene which is present before my mind’s eye as I write.
The community’s enthusiasm knew no bounds. The very next day there
was some accident in the theatre in consequence of which it  was
wholly destroyed by fire. On the third day friends brought me the
news of the fire and congratulated the community upon this good omen
which signified to them that the Ordinance would meet the same fate
as the theatre. I have never been influenced by such so-called signs
and therefore did not attach any weight to the coincidence. I</p>

The workers did not let the grass grow under their feet after this
great meeting. Meetings were held everywhere and pledges of
resistance were taken in every place. The principal topic of
discussion in <i>Indian Opinion </i>now was the Black Ordinance.</p>

At the other end, steps were taken in order to meet the Local
Government. A deputation waited upon Mr. Duncan, the Colonial
Secretary, and told him among other things about the pledge.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Sheth
Haji Habib, who was a member of the deputation, said, “I cannot
possibly restrain myself if any officer comes and proceeds to take my
wife’s finger prints. I will kill him there and then and die
myself.” The Minister stared at the Sheth’s face for a while and
said, “Government are reconsidering the advisability of making the
Ordinance applicable to women, and I can assure you at once that the
clauses relating to women will be deleted. Government have 
understood your feeling in the matter and desire to respect it. But
as for the other provisions, I am sorry to inform you that Government
are and will remain adamant. General Botha wants you to agree to this
legislation after due deliberation. Government deem it to be
essential to the existence of the Europeans. They will certainly
consider any suggestions about details which you may make
consistently with the objects of the Ordinance, and my advice to the
deputation is that your interest lies in agreeing to the legislation
and proposing changes only as regards the details.” I am leaving
out here the particulars of the discussion with the Minister, as all
those arguments have already been dealt with.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The arguments were just the same; there was only a difference in
phraseology as they were set forth before the Minister. The
deputation withdrew, after informing him that his advice
notwithstanding, acquiescence in the proposed legislation was out of
the question, and after thanking Government for their intention of
exempting women from its provisions. It is difficult to say whether
the exemption of women was the first fruit of the community’s
agitation, or whether the Government as an afterthought made a
concession to practical considerations which Mr. Curtis had ruled out
of his scientific</p>

None of us knew what name to give to our movement. I then used the
term ‘passive resistance’ in describing it. I did not then quite
understand the implications of ‘passive resistance’ as I called
it. I only knew that some new principle had come into being. As the
struggle advanced, the phrase ‘passive resistance’ gave rise to
confusion and it appeared shameful to permit this great struggle to
be known only by an English name. Again, that foreign phrase could
hardly pass as current coin among the community. A small prize was
therefore announced in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>to be awarded to
the reader who invented the best designation for our struggle.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>We
thus received  a number of suggestions. The meaning of the struggle
had been then fully discussed in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>and the
competitors for the prize had fairly sufficient material to serve as
a basis for their exploration. Shri Maganlal Gandhi was one of the
competitors and he suggested the word <i>sadagraha, </i>meaning
‘firmness in a good cause’. I liked the word, but it did not
fully represent the whole idea I wished it to connote. I therefore
corrected it to ‘satyagraha’. Truth <i>(satya) </i>implies love,
and firmness <i>(agraha) </i>engenders and therefore serves as a
synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement
‘satyagraha’, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth
and Love or non-violence, and gave up the use of the  phrase ‘passive
resistance’, in connection with it, so much so that even in English
writing we often avoided it and used instead the word ‘satyagraha’
itself or some other equivalent English phrase. This then was the
genesis of the movement which came to be known as satyagraha, and of
the word used as a designation for it. Before we proceed any further
with our history we shall do well to grasp the difference between
passive resistance and satyagraha, which is the subject of our next
chapter.</p>

with interest. Although the English newspapers in the Transvaal
generally wrote in support of the Europeans and of the Black Act,
they willingly published contributions from well-known Indians. They
also published Indian representations to Government in full or at
least a summary of these, sometimes sent their reporters to important
meetings of the Indians, and when such was not the case, made room
for the brief reports we sent them.</p>

These amenities were of course very useful to the community, and by
and by some leading Europeans came to take interest in the movement
as it progressed. One of these was Mr. Hosken, one of the magnates of
Johannesburg. He had always been free from colour prejudice but his
interest in the Indian question deepened after the starting of
satyagraha. The Europeans of Germiston, which is something like a
suburb of Johannesburg, expressed a desire to hear me. A meeting was
held, and introducing me and the movement I stood for to the  
audience,  Mr.  Hosken<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1    </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>observed,  “The   Transvaal Indians have had recourse
to passive resistance when all other means of securing redress proved
to be of no avail. They do not enjoy the franchise. Numerically, they
are only a few. They are  weak  and haveno arms. Therefore they have
taken to passive resistance which is a weapon of the weak.” These
observations took me by surprise, and the speech which I was going to
make took an altogether different complexion in consequence<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. In contradicting Mr. Hosken, I defined our passive
resistance as ‘soul-force’. I saw at this meeting that a use of
the phrase ‘passive resistance’ was apt to give rise to terrible
misunderstanding. I will try to distinguish between passive
resistance and soul-force by amplifying the argument which I made
before that meeting so as to make things clearer.</p>

of legislation, instead of rising in rebellion they took the passive
or milder step of not submitting to the law and inviting the
penalties of such non-submission upon their heads. When the British
Parliament passed the Education Act some years ago the
Non-conformists offered passive resistance under the leadership of
Dr. Clifford.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>The great movement of the English women for the vote was
also known as passive resistance. It was in view of these two cases
that Mr. Hosken described passive resistance as a weapon of the weak
or the voteless. Dr. Clifford and his friends had the vote, but as
they were  in  a minority in the Parliament, they could not prevent
the passage of the Education Act. That is to say, they were weak in
numbers. Not that they were averse to the use of arms for the
attainment of their aims, but they had no hope of succeeding by force
of arms. And in a well-regulated State, recourse to arms every now
and then in order to secure popular rights would defeat its own
purpose. Again some of the Non-conformists would generally object to
taking up arms even if it was a practical proposition. The
suffragists had no franchise rights. They were weak in numbers as
well as in physical force. Thus their case lent colour to Mr.
Hosken’s observations. The suffragist movement did not eschew the
use of physical force. Some suffragists fired buildings and even
assaulted men. I do not think they ever intended to kill anyone. But
they did intend to thrash people when an opportunity occurred, and
even thus to make things hot for them.</p>

But brute force had absolutely no place in the Indian movement in any
circumstance, and the reader will see, as we pro ceed, that no matter
how badly they suffered, the satyagrahis never used physical force,
and that too although there were occasions when they were in a
position to use it effectively. Again, although the Indians had no
franchise and were weak, these considerations had nothing to do with
the organization of satyagraha. This is not to say that the Indians
would have taken to satyagraha even if they had possessed arms or the
franchise. Probably there would not have been any scope for
satyagraha if they had the franchise. If they had arms, the opposite</p>

party would have thought twice before antagonizing them. One can
therefore understand that people who possess arms would have fewer
occasions for offering satyagraha. My point is that I can definitely
assert that in planning the Indian movement there never was the
slightest thought given to the possibility or otherwise of offering 
armed resistance. Satyagraha is soul-force pure and simple, and
whenever and to whatever extent there is room for the use of arms or
physical force or brute force, there and to that extent is there so
much less possibility for soul-force. These are purely antagonistic
forces in my view, and I had full realization of this antagonism even
at the time of the advent of satyagraha.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
We will not stop here to consider whether these views are right or
wrong. We are only concerned to note the distinction between passive
resistance and satyagraha, and we have seen that there is a great and
fundamental difference between the two. If without  understanding
this, those who call themselves either passive resisters or
satyagrahis believe both to be one and the same thing, there would be
injustice to both, leading to untoward consequences. The result of
our using the phrase ‘passive resistance’ in South Africa was not
that people  admired us by ascribing to us the bravery and the
self-sacrifice of the suffragists, but that we were mistaken to be a
danger to person and property which the suffragists were, and even a
generous friend like Mr. Hosken imagined us to be weak. The power of
suggestion is such that a man at last becomes what he believes
himself to be. If we continue to believe ourselves and let others
believe that we are weak and therefore offer passive resistance, our
resistance will never make us strong, and at the earliest opportunity
we will give up passive resistance as a weapon of the weak. On the
other hand if we are satyagrahis and offer satyagraha believing
ourselves to be strong, two clear consequences result from it.
Fostering the idea of strength, we grow stronger and stronger every
day. With the increase in our strength, our satyagraha too becomes
more effective and we would never be casting about for an opportunity
to give it up. Again, there is no scope for love in passive
resistance; on the other hand, not only has hatred no place in
satyagraha, but it is a positive breach of its ruling principle.
While in passive resistance there is a scope for the use of arms when
a suitable occasion arrives, in satyagraha physical force is</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.26cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
forbidden even in the most favourable circumstances. Passive
resistance is often looked upon as a preparation for the use of
force, while satyagraha can never be utilized as such. Passive
resistance may be offered side by side with the use of arms.
Satyagraha and brute force, being each a negation of the other, can
never go together. Satyagraha may be offered to one’s nearest and
dearest; passive resistance can never be offered to them unless of
course they have ceased to be dear and become an object of hatred to
us. In passive resistance there is always present an idea of
harassing the other party and there is a simultaneous readiness to
undergo any hardships  entailed upon us by such activity; while in
satyagraha there is not the remotest idea of injuring the opponent.
Satyagraha postulates the conquest of the adversary by suffering in
one’s own person.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
These are the distinctions between the two forces. But I do not wish
to suggest that the merits or, if you like, the defects of passive
resistance thus enumerated are to be seen in every movement which
passes by that name. But it can be shown that these defects have been
noticed in many cases of passive resistance. Jesus Christ indeed has
been acclaimed as the prince of passive resisters but I submit in
that case passive resistance must mean satyagraha and satyagraha
alone. There are not many cases in history of passive resistance in
that sense. One of these is that of the of Russia cited by Tolstoy.
The phrase ‘passive resistance’ was not employed to denote the
patient suffering of oppression by thousands of devout Christians in
the early days of Christianity. I would therefore class them as
satyagrahis. And if their conduct be described as passive resistance,
passive resistance becomes synonymous  with  satyagraha. It  has 
been my object  in   the present chapter to show that satyagraha is
essentially different from what people generally mean in English by
the phrase ‘passive resistance’.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
While enumerating the characteristics of passive resistance, I had to
sound a note of warning in order to avoid injustice being done to
those who had recourse to it. It is also necessary to point out that
I do not claim for people calling themselves satyagrahis all  the 
merits which I have described as being characteristic of satyagraha.
I am not unaware of the fact that many a satyagrahi so called is an 
utter  stranger to them. Many suppose satyagraha to be a weapon of
the</p>

weak. Others have said that it is a preparation for armed resistance.
But I must repeat once more that it has not been my object to
describe satyagrahis as they are but to set forth the implications of
satyagraha and the characteristics of satyagrahis as they ought to
be.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
In a word, we had to invent a new term clearly to denote the movement
of the Indians in the Transvaal and to prevent its being confused
with passive resistance generally so called. I have tried to show in
the present chapter the various principles which were then held to be
a part and parcel of the connotation of that term.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

resisting the Black Act such as approaching the Local Government with
memorials, etc. The Legislative Council deleted the clause affecting
women, but the rest of the Ordinance was passed practically in the
shape in which it was first drafted. The spirit of the community was
then high and having closed its ranks it was unanimous in opposition
to the Ordinance. No one therefore was despondent. We however still
adhered to the resolution to exhaust all appropriate constitutional
remedies in the first instance. The Transvaal was yet a Crown Colony,
so that the Imperial Government was responsible for its legislation
as well as its administration. Therefore, the royal assent to
measures passed by its legislature was not a mere formality, but very
often it might so happen that the King, as advised by  his ministers,
might withhold his assent to such measures if they were found to be
in conflict with the spirit of the British Constitution. On the other
hand, in the case of a colony enjoying responsible government, the
royal assent to measures passed by its legislature is more often than
not a matter of course.</p>

 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>we
should once again obtain individual pledges from leading Indians, so
that if they had given way to doubt or weakness, they would be found
out. One of the reasons advanced by me in support of this suggestion
was that if the deputation was backed up by satyagraha they would
then have no fears and could boldly inform the Secretary of State for
India and the Secretary of State for the Colonies about the
resolution of the community. Secondly, arrangements for meeting the
expenses of thedeputation must be made in advance. And thirdly, the
maximum number of members should be fixed. I made this last
suggestion in order to correct the current misapprehension that a
large number of members would be able to put in more work, and to
bring this idea into relief that the members should join the
deputation not becauseit was an honour to them but with a
single-minded devotion to the cause.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

three suggestions were accepted. Signatures were taken. Many signed
the pledge, but still I saw even among those who had orally pledged
themselves at the meeting, there were some who hesitated to sign it.
When once a man has pledged himself he need not hesitate to pledge
himself a hundred  times. And yet it is  no uncommon experience to
find men weakening in regard to pledges deliberately taken and
getting perplexed when asked to put down a verbal pledge in black and
white. The necessary funds, too, were found. The greatest difficulty
however was encountered in selecting the personnel of the
deputation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

worked with devotion and frankness and thus given a fine lead to the
community. My advice was that there must be a Mussalman gentleman
going with me, and that the personnel should be limited to two. But
the Hindus at once said that as I represented the Indian community as
a whole, there should be a representative of Hindu interests. Some
even said that there should be one  Konkani Mussalman, one Memon, one

H. O. Ali could be considered a semi-Malay. His father was an Indian
Mussalman and his mother a Malay. His mother tongue, we might say,
was Dutch. But he had been so well educated in English that he could

of writing to the newspapers. He was a member of the Transvaal

In England and other Western countries there is one, in my view,
barbarous custom of inaugurating movements at dinners. The British
Premier delivers in the Mansion House on the ninth of November an
important speech in which he adumbrates his programme for the year
and publishes his own forecast of the future, and which therefore
attracts universal notice. Cabinet ministers among others are invited
to dinner by the Lord Mayor of London, and when the dinner is over,
bottles of wine are uncorked, all present drink to the health of the
host and the guest, and speeches too are made while this merry
business is in progress. The toast to the British Cabinet is
proposed, and the Premier makes the important speech referred to in
reply to it. And as in public, so in private, the person with whom
some important conversations are to be held is, as a matter of
custom, invited to dinner, and the topic of the day is broached
either at or after dinner. We too had to observe this custom not once
but quite a number of times, although of course we never touched meat
or liquor. We thus invited our principal supporters to lunch. About a
hundred covers were laid. The idea was to tender our thanks to our
friends, to  bid  them  good-bye and at the same time to constitute
the Standing Committee. Here   too,   speeches<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

But I must place one or two sacred reminiscences on record before
closing this chapter. We had utilized every single minute of our time
in England. The sending of a large number of circulars, etc., could
not be done single-handed, and we were sorely in need of outside
help. Money indeed does bring us this kind of help, but my experience
ranging over forty years has taught me that assistance thus purchased
can never compare with purely voluntary service. Fortunately for us
we had many volunteer helpers. Many an Indian youth who was in
England for study surrounded us and some of them helped us day and
night without any hope of reward or fame. I do not remember that any
of them ever refused to do anything as being beneath his dignity, be
it the writing of addresses or the fixing of stamps or the posting of
letters. But there was an  English  friend named Simmonds who cast
all these into the shade. Whom the gods love die young and so did
this benevolent Englishman. I first met him in South Africa. He had
been in India. When he was in Bombay in 1897, he moved fearlessly
among the Indians affected by the plague and nursed them. It had
become second nature with him not to be daunted by death when
ministering to sufferers from infectious diseases. He was perfectly
free from any race or colour prejudice. He was independent in
temperament. He believed that truth is always with the minority. It
was this belief of his which first drew him to me in Johannesburg,
and he often humorously assured me that he would withdraw his support
of me if he ever found me in a majority, as he was of opinion that
truth itself is corrupted in the hands of a majority. He had read
very widely. He was private secretary to Sir George Farrar, one of
the millionaires of Johannesburg. He was an expert stenographer. He
happened to be in England when we were there. I did not know where he
was, but the noble Englishman found us out as our public work had
secured for us newspaper advertisement. He expressed his willingness
to do for us anything he could. “I will work as a servant if you
like,” he said, “and if you need a stenographer, you know you can
scarcely come across the like of me.” We were in need of both these
kinds of help, and I am not exaggerating when I say that this
Englishman toiled for us day and night without any payment. He was
always on the typewriter till twelve or one o’clock at night.
Simmonds would carry messages and post letters, always with a smile
curling round his lips. His monthly income was about forty-five
pounds, but he spent it all in helping his friends and others. He was
about thirty years of age. He was unmarried and wanted to remain so</p>

flatly refused and said, “I would be failing in my duty if I
accepted any remuneration for this service.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

For the benefit of young aspirants after public work I note down the
fact that we were so punctilious in keeping the accounts of the
deputation that we preserved even such trifling vouchers as  the
receipts for the money spent in the steamers on, say, soda water.
Similarly we preserved the receipts for telegrams. I do not remember
to have entered a single item under sundries when writing the
detailed accounts. As a rule, sundries did not figure in our accounts
at all, and if they did they were intended to cover a few pennies or
shillings the manner of whose spending we could not recall at the
time of writing the accounts at the end of the day.</p>

I have clearly observed in this life the fact that we become trustees
or responsible agents from the time that we reach years of
discretion. So long as we are with our parents, we mustaccount to
them for moneys or business they entrust to us. They may be sure of
our rectitude and may not ask us for accounts, but that does not
affect our responsibility. When one becomes an independent
householder, there arises the responsibility to one’s family. We
are not the sole proprietors of our acquisitions; our family is a
co-sharer of them along with ourselves. We must account for every
single pie for their sake. If such is our responsibility in private
life, in public life it is all the greater. I have observed that
voluntary workers are apt to behave as if they were not bound to
render a detailed account of the business or moneys with which they
are entrusted because like Caesar’s wife they are above suspicion.
This is sheer nonsense, as the keeping of account has nothing

 more  so   when  we reached Johannesburg, we saw that we had
over-rated the Madeira cablegram. Mr. Ritch, who sent it, was not
responsible for this. He cabled only what he had heard about the
measure being disallowed. As we have already observed, the Transvaal
was then, that is to say in 1906, a Crown Colony. Crown Colonies are
represented in England by agents one of whose duties it is to
instruct the Secretary of State for the Colonies in all matters
affecting Colonial interests. The Transvaal was then represented by
Sir Richard Solomon, the noted lawyer of South Africa. Lord Elgin had
disallowed the Black Act in consultation with him. Responsible
government was to be conferred on the Transvaal on January l, 1907.
Lord Elgin therefore assured Sir  Richard that, if an identical
measure was passed by the Transvaal legislature constituted after the
grant of responsible government, it would not be refused the royal
assent. But so long as the Transvaal was a Crown Colony, the Imperial
Government would be held directly responsible for such class
legislation, and as racial discrimination was a departure from the
fundamental principles of the British Empire, he could not but advise
His Majesty to disallow the measure in question.</p>

If the measure was to be thus disallowed only in name and if the
Transvaal Europeans could at the same time have their own way, Sir
Richard Solomon had no reason to object to such an excellent
arrangement. I have characterized this as crooked policy, but I
believe it could be given a still harsher name with perfect justice.

the ground of race or colour. So far so good. One can also understand
that the Imperial Government could not all at  once disallow measures
passed by the legislatures of Colonies enjoying responsible
government. But to hold private conferences with Colonial agents and
in advance to promise the royal assent to legislation which is in
open violation of the Imperial Constitution,—what is this if it is
not a breach of faith and an injustice to those whose rights are thus
pilfered? Really speaking, Lord Elgin by his assurance encouraged the
Transvaal Europeans in their anti-Indian activities. If he wanted to
do this, he ought to have told the Indian deputation so in plain
terms. As a matter of fact, the Empire cannot escape responsibility
even for the legislation of Colonies enjoying responsible government.
Even such Colonies are bound to accept the fundamental principles of
the British Constitution. As for example, no such colony can revive
the institution of legalized slavery. If Lord Elgin disallowed the
Black Act because it was an improper piece of legislation, and he
could disallow it only on this ground, it was his clear duty
privately to have warned Sir Richard Solomon that the Transvaal could
not enact such an iniquitous law after the grant of responsible
government, and if it had any intention of doing so, the Imperial
Government would be constrained to reconsider the advisability of
granting it any such superior status. Or he should have told Sir
Richard that responsible government could be conferred only on
condition that the rights of the Indians were fully safeguarded.
Instead of following such straightforward procedure, Lord Elgin made
an outward show of friendliness to the Indians, while at the same
time he  really  and secretly supported the Transvaal Government and
encouraged it to pass once more the very law which he had
himselfvetoed. This is not the only or the first case of such
tortuous policy followed by the British Empire. Even an indifferent
student of its history will easily recall similar incidents.</p>

Responsible government was established in the Transvaal. The first
measure passed by the new Parliament was the budget; the second was
the Asiatic Registration Act, which was, except for an alteration in
the date specified in one of its clauses, which lapse of time made
necessary, an exact replica of the original Ordinance, and was rushed
through all its stages at a  single  sitting  on  March  21,  1907.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

forgotten as if it was a dream. The Indians submitted memorials,
etc., as usual, but who would listen to them? The Act was proclaimed
to take effect from July 1, 1907, and Indians were called upon to
apply for registration under it before July 31. The delay in
enforcing the Act was due not to any desire to oblige the Indians,
but to the exigencies of the case. Some time must elapse before the
formal sanction of the Crown to the measure was signified, and the
preparation of the forms set forth in schedules and the opening of
permit offices at various centres would also  take  time.  The

show his strong feeling in the matter. According to the golden rule
that a person’s words must not be interpreted so as to do him an
injustice, I take it that the gentleman used this graphic language
only in order to evince his strong feeling. However that may be, on
one side the Transvaal Government was preparing to throw the dog’s
collar on the Indians’ necks, while on the other side the Indians
were getting ready to put up a fight against the wicked policy of
that Government and were concerting measures calculated to strengthen
them in their resolution never to wear that collar. Of course, we
were writing letters to friends in England as well as in India and
trying thus to keep them in touch with the situation from day to day.
But a satyagraha struggle depends but little upon help from outside,
and it is only internal remedies that are effective. The leaders’
time therefore was chiefly taken up with the endeavours to keep all
the elements of the community up to the mark.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
One important question before us was what agency we should use for
carrying on the struggle. The Transvaal British Indian Association
had a large membership. Satyagraha had not yet seen the light of day
when it was established. The Association had resisted in the past,
and must resist in the future, not one obnoxious law, but quite a
host of them. Besides organizing resistance to obnoxious legislation,
it had many other functions of a political and social nature to 
perform. Again all the members of the Association were not pledged to
resist the Black Act through satyagraha. At the same time, we must
take account of external risks to which the Association would be
exposed in the event of its being identified with the satyagraha
struggle. What if the Transvaal Government declared the struggle to
be seditious and all institutions carrying it on as illegal bodies?
What in such a case would be the position of members who were not
satyagrahis? Andwhat about the funds which were contributed at a time
when satyagraha was not so much as thought of? All these were weighty
considerations. Lastly, the satyagrahis were  strongly  of opinion
that they not only must not entertain any ill will against those who
did not join the struggle whether for want of faith or weakness or
any other reason whatever, but must maintain their present friendly
relations with them unimpaired and even work side by side with them</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
in all other movements except the satyagraha struggle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.15cm; line-height: 110%">
For all these reasons the community came to the conclusion that the
satyagraha struggle should not be carried on through any of the
existing oganizations. They might render all help in their power and
resist the Black Act in every way open to them except that of
satyagraha, for which a new body named the ‘Passive Resistance
Association’ was started by the satyagrahis. The reader will see
from this English name that the word satyagraha had not yet been
invented when this new Association came into being. Time fully
justified the wisdom of constituting a fresh body for the work, and
the satyagraha movement might perhaps have suffered a set-back if any
of  the existing organizations had been mixed up with it. Numerous
members joined this new Association, and the community furnished it
funds too with a lavish hand.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
My experience has taught me that no movement ever stops or languishes
for want of funds. This does not mean that any temporal movement can
go on without money, but it does mean that wherever it has good men
and true at its helm, it is bound to attract to itself the requisite
funds. On the other hand, I have also observed that a movement takes
its downward course from the time that it is afflicted with a
plethora of funds. When therefore a public institution is managed
from the interests of investments, I dare not call it a sin but I do
say that it is a highly improper procedure. The public should be the
bank for all public institutions, which should not last a day longer
than the public wish. An institution run with the interest  of 
accumulated capital ceases to be amenable to public opinion and
becomes autocratic and self-righteous. This is not the place to dwell
upon the corruption of many a social and religious  institution 
managed with permanent funds. The phenomenon is so common that he who
runs may read it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 110%">
But we must return to our narrative. Lawyers and English-educated
persons do not by any means enjoy a monopoly of hair-splitting. I saw
that even the uneducated Indians in South Africa were quite capable
of drawing minute distinctions and making fine arguments. Some argued
that the pledge taken in the old Empire Theatre had been fulfilled as
the old Ordinance was disallowed, and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
those who had weakened since then took shelter under this plea. The
argument was not quite devoid of force, yet it could not impress
those whose resistance was not to the law as a law but to the vicious
principle underlying it. All the same it was found necessary to
re-administer the oath of resistance for safety’s sake just to
reinforce the awakening of the community and to probe the extent of
its weakness if any. Meetings therefore were held in every place,
where the situation was explained, the oath was administered afresh
and the spirit of the community was found to be as high as ever.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
Meanwhile, the fateful month of July was gradually drawing to an end,
and on the last day of that month we had resolved to call a mass
meeting of the Indians at Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal.
Delegates from other places besides were also invited to attend. The
meeting was held in the open on the grounds of Pretoria mosque. After
the inauguration of satyagraha our meetings were so largely attended
that no building could accommodate them. The entire Indian population
in the Transvaal did not exceed 13,000 souls, of whom over 10,000
lived in Johannesburg and Pretoria. An attendance at public meetings
of two thousand from an aggregate population of ten thousand would be
considered large and satisfactory in any part of the world. A
movement of mass satyagraha is impossible on any other condition.
Where the struggle is wholly dependent upon internal strength, it
cannot go on at all without mass discipline. The workers therefore
did not consider such large attendance as anything surprising. From
the very first they had decided to hold public meetings only in the
open so that expense was nearly avoided and none had to go back from
the place of meeting disappointed for want of accommodation. All
these meetings, again, were mostly very quiet. The audiences heard
everything attentively. If those who were far away from the platform
could not hear a speaker, they would ask him to speak louder. The
reader scarcely needs to be told that there were no chairs at these
meetings. Everyone sat on the ground. There was a very small platform
designed to accommodate the chairman, the speaker and a couple of
friends, and a small table and a few chairs or stools were placed
upon it.</p>

naturally anxious in spite of all their enthusiasm; but no less
anxious than  they  were  General  Botha  and  General  Smuts,  all 
the  might of   the   Transvaal   Government   at   their   back   
notwithstanding. No one would like to bend a whole community to his
willby sheer force. General Botha therefore had sent Mr. William
Hosken to this meeting to admonish us. The reader has already made
this gentleman’s acquaintance in a previous chapter. The meeting
received him warmly, and he said, “You know I am your friend. I
need scarcely say that my feelings in this matter are with you. If at
all I could, I would gladly make your opponents accede to your
demands. But you hardly need to be told about the general hostility
of the Transvaal Europeans to your community. I am here at General
Botha’s instance. He has asked me to be the bearer of his message
to this meeting. He entertains a feeling of respect for you and
understands your sentiments, but he says he is helpless. All the
Europeans in the Transvaal unanimously ask for such a law, and he
himself is convinced of the necessity for it. The Indians know fully
well how powerful the Transvaal Government is. The law has again been
endorsed by the Imperial Government. The Indians have done all they
could and have acquitted themselves like men. But now that their
opposition has failed, and the law has been passed,  the community
must prove their loyalty and love of peace by submitting to it.
General Smuts will carefully look into any representations you make
suggesting minor changes in the regulations framed in virtue of the
Registration Act. My own advice to you also is that you should comply
with the General’s message. I know that the Transvaal Government is
firm regarding this law. To resist it will be to dash your head
against a wall. I wish that your community may not be ruined in
fruitless opposition or invite needless suffering on their heads.”

them on their guard on my own behalf.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

One of these speakers was the late Ahmad Muhammad Kachhalia the hero,
not of this chapter alone, but of the present volume. I knew him only
as a client and as an interpreter. He had never before then taken a
leading part in public work. He had a working  knowledge  of English,
which he had so far improved by practice that when he took his
friends to English lawyers, he acted as interpreter himself. But
interpretership was not a profession with him; he worked as
interpreter only as a friend. He at first used to hawk piecegoods,
and then to tradeon a small scale in partnership with his brother. He
was a Surti Memon and enjoyed great reputation in his class. His
knowledge of Gujarati was also limited but in this too he had greatly
advanced, being schooled by experience. He had such sharp
intelligence that he very easily grasped anything that was put to
him. He solved legal difficulties with such facility as often
astonished me. He would not hesitate to argue law even with lawyers,
and very often his arguments were worthy of consideration by them.</p>

I have never, whether in South Africa or in India, come across a man
who could surpass Mr. Kachhalia in courage and steadfastness. He
sacrificed his all for the community’s sake. He was always a man of
his word. He was a strict orthodox Mussalman, being one of the
trustees of the Surti Memon mosque. But at the same time he looked
upon Hindus and Mussalmans with an equal eye. I do not remember that
he ever fanatically or improperly sided with Mussalmans  as against
Hindus. Perfectly fearless and impartial as he was, he never
hesitated to point out their faults to Hindus as well as Mussalmans
whenever he found it necessary. His simplicity and humility were
worthy of imitation. My close contact with him for years leads me to
hold firmly to the opinion that a community can rarely boast of

thundered forth: “I swear in the name of God that I will be hanged
but I will not submit to this law, and I hope that everyone present
will do likewise.” So saying he took his seat. As he moved his
fingers on his throat, some of those seated on the platform smiled,
and I remember that I joined them in their smile. I was rather
doubtful whether Kachhalia Sheth would be able fully to translate his
brave words into action. I am ashamed of this doubt now, and every
time I think of it. Kachhaliaalways remained to the fore among the
many Indians who observed their pledge to the letter in that great
struggle without a moment’s flinching.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The meeting cheered him as he spoke. Others then knew him very much
better than I did, as many of them were personally familiar with this
obscure hero. They knew that Kachhalia only says what he means and
means what he says. There were other spirited speeches too. But I
have singled out Kachhalia Sheth’s for mention,  as  it proved to
be a prophecy of his subsequent career. Not everyone of the spirited
speakers stood the final test. This great man died in 1918, four
years after the struggle was over, serving the community till the
last.</p>

I will close this chapter with a reminiscence of Kachhalia Sheth
which may not find a place elsewhere. The reader later on will hear
of Tolstoy Farm where lived a number of satyagrahi families. The
Sheth sent his ten or twelve-year-old son Ali to be educated there as
an example to others and in order that the boy might be brought up to
a life of simplicity and service. It was due to the example he thus
set that other Mussalmans likewise sent their boys to the Farm. Ali
was a modest, bright, truthful and straightforward boy. God took him
unto Himself before his father. If it had been given to him to live,
I doubt not he would have turned out to be the worthy son of an
excellent father.</p>

is to say, to post volunteers on the roads leading there to, and
these</p>

volunteers were to warn weak-kneed Indians against the trap laid for
them there. Volunteers were provided with badges and expressly
instructed not to be impolite to any Indian taking out a permit. They
must ask him his name, but if he refused to give it they must not on
any account be violent or rude to him. To every Indian going to the
permit office, they were to hand a printed paper detailing the
injuries which submission to the Black Act would involve and explain
what was written in it. They must behave towards the police too with
due respect. If the police abused or thrashed them, they must suffer
peacefully; if the ill-treatment by the police was insufferable they
should leave the place. If the police arrested them, they should
gladly surrender themselves. If some such incident occurred in
Johannesburg, it should be brought to my notice. At other places
thelocal secretaries were to be informed and asked for further
instructions. Each party of pickets had a captain whose orders must
be obeyed by the rest.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
This was the community’s first experience of that kind. All who
were above the age of twelve were taken as pickets, so that there
were many young men from 12 to 18 years of age enrolled as such. But
not one was taken who was unknown to the local workers. Over and
above all these precautions, people were informed, by announcements
at every public meeting and otherwise, that, if anyone desirous of
taking out a permit was afraid of the pickets, he could ask the
workers to detail a volunteer to escort him to the permit office and
back. Some did avail themselves of this offer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
The volunteers in every place worked with  boundless enthusiasm, and
were ever alert and wide awake in the performance of their duties.
Generally speaking, there was not much molestation by the police.
When sometimes there was such molestation, the volunteers quietly put
up with it. They brought to bear upon their work quite an amount of
humour, in which the police too sometimes joined. They devised
various diversions in order to beguile their time. Some of them were
once arrested on a charge of obstructing the public traffic. As
non-co-operation did not form a part of the satyagraha struggle
there, defence could be made in courts, though as a rule advocates
for defence were not paid from public funds. The volunteers were
declared innocent and acquitted by the court, which still  further
exalted their spirit.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.09cm">Although
the Indians who wanted to take out permits were thus</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
saved from rudeness or violence from the volunteers in public, I must
admit that there arose a body of men in connection with  the
movement, who without becoming volunteers privately threatened those
who would take out permits with violence or injury in other ways.
This was a most painful development, and strong measures were adopted
in order to stamp it out as soon as it was found out. The holding out
of threats nearly ceased in consequence, though it was not quite
rooted out. The threats left an impression behind them and, as I
could see, thus far injured the cause. Those who were threatened
instantly sought Government protection and got it. Poison was thus
instilled into the community, and those who were weak already grew
weaker still. The poison thus grew more virulent, as the weak are
always apt to be revengeful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
These threats created but little impression; but the force  of 
public opinion on the one hand, and on the other, the fear of one’s
name being known to the community through the presence of volunteers
acted as powerful deterrents. I do not know a single Indian who held
it proper to submit to the Black Act. Those who submitted did so out
of an inability to suffer hardships or pecuniary losses, and were
therefore ashamed of themselves. This sense of shame, as well as a
fear of loss in trade following upon the displeasure of big Indian
merchants, pressed heavily upon them, and some leading Indians found
a way out of this twofold difficulty. They arranged with the permit
office, that an officer should meet them in a private house after
nine or ten o’clock at night and give them permits. They thought
that in this case no one would know about their submission to the law
for some time at least and that as they were leaders, others would
follow suit, thus lightening their burden of shame. It did not matter
if they were found out afterwards.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
But the volunteers were so vigilant that the community was kept
informed of what happened every moment. There would be some even in
the permit office who might give such information to the satyagrahis.
Others, again, though weak themselves would be unable to tolerate the
idea of leaders thus disgracing themselves, and would inform the
satyagrahis from an idea that they too could face the music if the
leaders were firm. In this way the community once received
information that certain men were going to take out permits in a
certain shop on a certain night. The community therefore first tried
to dissuade these men. The shop too was picketed. But human weakness</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
cannot be long suppressed. Some leading men took out permits in this
way at ten or eleven o’clock at night, and there was a rift in the
lute. The very next day their names were published by the community.
But a sense of shame has its limits. Considerations of self-interest
drive shame away and mislead men out of the strait and narrow path.
By and by something like five hundred men took out permits. For some
time<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

of shame wore out, some went publicly to the Asiatic office and

When the Asiatic Department found that, notwithstanding all their
exertions, they could not get more than 500 Indians to register, they
decided to arrest someone. In Germiston there lived many Indians, one
of whom was Pandit Rama Sundara. This man had a brave look and was
endowed with some gift of the gab. He knew a few Sanskrit verses by
heart. Hailing from North India as he did, he naturally knew a few
<i>dohas </i>and <i>chopais </i>from the Tulasi <i>Ramayana, </i>and
owing to his designation Pandit, he also enjoyed some reputation
among the people. He delivered a number of spirited speeches in
various places. Some malevolent Indians in Germiston suggested to the
Asiatic Department that many Indians there would take  out  permits
if Rama Sundara was arrested, and the officers concerned could
scarcely resist the temptation thus offered. So Rama Sundara was put
under arrest, and this being the first case of its kind, the
Government as well as the Indians were much agitated over it. Rama
Sundara, who was till yesterday known only to the good people of
Germiston, became in one moment famous all over South Africa. He
became the cynosure of all eyes as if he were a great man put upon
his trial. Government need not have taken, but it did take, special
measures for the preservation of peace. In the Court too Rama Sundara
was accorded due respect as no ordinary prisoner but a representative
of his community. Eager Indian spectators filled the court-room. Rama
Sundara was sentenced to a month’s  simple imprisonment, and kept
in a separate cell in the European ward in the Johannesburg jail.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

permitted to receive food from outside, and was entertained every day
with delicacies prepared on behalf of the community.  He  was
provided with everything he wanted. The day on which he was sentenced
was celebrated with great eclat. There was no trace of depression,
but on the other hand there was exultation and rejoicing. Hundreds
were ready to go to jail. The officers of the Asiatic Department were
disappointed in their hope of a bumper crop of registrants. They did
not get a single registrant even from Germiston. The only gainer was
the Indian community.</p>

The month was soon over. Rama Sundara was released and was taken in a
procession to the place where a meeting had been arranged. Vigorous
speeches were made. Rama Sundara was smothered with garlands of
flowers. The volunteers held a feast in his honour, and hundreds of
Indians envied Rama Sundara’s luck and were sorry that they had not
the chance of suffering imprisonment.</p>

was no escape from the month’s imprisonment, as his arrest came as
a surprise. In jail he had enjoyed luxuries to which he had been a
stranger outside. Still accustomed as he was to licence, and addicted
as he was to bad habits, the loneliness and the restraints of jail
life were too much for him. In spite of all the attention showered
upon him by the jail authorities as well as by the community, jail
appeared irksome to him and he bade a final good-bye to the Transvaal
and to the movement. There are clever men in every community and in
every movement and so there were in ours. These knew Rama Sundara
through and through, but from an idea that even he might become an
instrument of the community’s providence, they never let me know
his secret history until his bubble had finally burst. I subsequently
found that he was an indentured labourer who had deserted before
completing his term. There was nothing discreditable in his having
been an indentured labourer. The reader will see towards the end how
indentured labourers proved to be a most valuable acquisition to the
movement, and what a large contribution they made towards winning the
final victory. It was certainly wrong for him not to have finished
his period of indenture.</p>

cannot be kept out. And yet if the leaders are fearless and true, the
entry of undesirable persons into the movement without their knowing

our credit, the enthusiasm created by his trial came to stay, and
profiting by his example, weaklings slipped away out of the movement
of their own accord. There were some more cases of such weakness
besidesthis but I do not propose to deal with them in any detail, as
it would not serve any useful purpose. In order that the reader may
appreciate the strength and the weakness of the community at their
real worth, it will be enough to say that there was not one Rama
Sundara but several and yet I observed that the movement reaped pure
advantage from all of them.</p>

Let not the reader point the finger of scorn at Rama Sundara. All men
are imperfect, and when imperfection is observed in someone in a
larger measure than in others, people are apt to blame him. But that
is not fair. Rama Sundara did not become weak intentionally. Man can
change his temperament, can control it, but cannot eradicate it. God
has not given him so much liberty. If the leopard can change his
spots then only can man modify the peculiarities of his spiritual
constitution. Although Rama Sundara fled away, who can tell how<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>he
might have repented of his weakness? Or rather was not his very
flight a powerful proof of his repentance? There was no need for him
to flee if he was shameless. He could have taken out a permit and
steered clear of jail by submission to the Black Act. Further, if at
all so minded, he could have become a tool of the Asiatic Department,
misguided his friends and become <i>persona grata </i>with the
Government. Why should we not judge him charitably and say that
instead of doing anything of the kind, he, being ashamed of his
weakness, hid his face from the community and even did it a service?</p>

I propose to acquaint the reader with all the weapons, internal as
well as external, employed in the satyagraha struggle and now
therefore proceed to introduce to him <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>, a
 weekly journal which is published in South Africa to this very day.
The credit for starting the first Indian-owned printing press in
South Africa is due to a Gujarati gentleman, Shri Madanjit
Vyavaharik. After he had conducted the press for a few years in the
midst of difficulties, he thought of bringing out a newspaper too. He
consulted the late Shri Mansukhlal Nazar and myself. The paper was
issued from Durban.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1 </font></sup>Shri
Mansukhlal Nazar volunteered to act as unpaid editor. From the very
first the paper was conducted at a loss. At last we decided to
purchase a farm, to settle upon it all the workers, who must
constitute themselves into a sort of commonwealth, and publish the
paper from the farm. The farm selected for the purpose is situated on
a beautiful hill thirteen miles from Durban. The nearest railway
station is at a distance of three miles from the farm<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
 is   called  Phoenix.  The paper was and is called <i>Indian
</i><i>Opinion</i>. It was formerly published in English, Gujarati,
Hindi and Tamil. But the Hindi and Tamil sections were eventually
discontinued,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>as the burden they imposed upon us seemed to be
excessive; we would not find Tamil and Hindi writers willing to
settle upon the farm and could not exercise a check upon them. The
paper was thus being published in English and Gujarati when the
satyagraha struggle commenced. Among the settlers on the farm were
Gujaratis, North Indians and Tamilians as well as Englishmen. After
the premature death of Mansukhlal Nazar,  his place as editor was
taken by an English friend, Herbert Kitchin. Then the post of editor
was long filled by Mr. Henry S. L. Polak and during our incarceration
the late Rev. Joseph Doke also acted as editor.</p>

Through the medium of this paper we could very well disseminate the
news of the week among the community. The English section kept those
Indians informed about the movement who did not know Gujarati, and
for Englishmen in India, England and South Africa, <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion
</i>served the purpose of a weekly newsletter. I believe that a
struggle which chiefly relies upon internal strength can be carried
on without a newspaper, but it is also my experience that we could
not perhaps have educated the local Indian community, nor kept
Indians all over the world in touch with the course of events in
South Africa in any other way with the same ease and success as
through <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion, </i>which therefore was certainly a
most useful and potent weapon in our struggle.</p>

As the community was transformed in the course and as a result of the
struggle, so was <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>. In the beginning we
used to accept advertisements for it, and also execute job-work in
the printing press.  I  observed  that  some   of   our   best   men 
 had   to   be  spared  for  this  kind  of work.  If  we  did  
receive   advertisements for publication, there was constant
difficulty in deciding which toaccept and which to refuse. Again one
would be inclined to refuse an objectionable advertisement, and yet
be constrained to accept it, say because the advertiser was a leading
member of the community and might take it ill if his advertisement
was rejected. Some of the good workers had to be set apart for
canvassing and realizing outstandings from advertisers, not to speak
of the flattery which advertisers claimed as their due. Moreover, the
view commended itself, that if the paper was conducted not because it
yielded profit but purely with a view to service, the service should
not be imposed upon the community by force but should be rendered
only if the community wished. And the clearest proof of such wish
would be forthcoming if they became subscribers in sufficiently large
numbers to make the paper self-supporting. Finally it seemed that it
was in every way better for all concerned that we should approach the
generality of the community and explain to them the duty of keeping
their newspaper going rather than set about to induce a few traders
to place their advertisements with us in the name of service. On all
these grounds we stopped advertisements in the paper, with the
gratifying result that those who were at first engrossed in the
advertisement department could now devote their labours to improving
the paper. The community realized at once their proprietorship of
<i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>and their consequent responsibility for
maintaining it. The workers were relieved of all</p>

anxiety in that respect. Their only care now was to put their best
work into the paper so long as the community wanted it, and they were
not only not ashamed of requesting any Indian to subscribe to <i>Indian
</i><i>Opinion</i>, but thought it even their duty to do so. A change
came over the internal strength and the character of the paper, and
it became a force to reckon with. The number of subscribers which
generally ranged between twelve and fifteen hundred increased day by
day. The rates of subscription had to be raised and yet when the
struggle was at its height, there were as many as 3,500 subscribers.
The number of Indians who could read <i>Indian Opinion </i>in South
Africa was at the outside 20,000, and therefore a circulation of over
three thousand copies may be held to be quite satisfactory. The
community had made the paper their own to such an extent that if
copies did not reach Johannesburg at the expected time, I would be
flooded  with complaints about it. The paper generally reached
Johannesburg on Sunday morning. I know of many whose first occupation
after they received the paper would be to read the Gujarati section
through from beginning to end. One of the company would read it, and
the restwould surround him and listen. Not all who wanted to read the
paper could afford to subscribe to it by themselves and some of them
would therefore club together for the purpose.</p>

We have seen how the Government failed to reap any advantage from
Rama Sundara’s arrest. On the other hand they observed the spirit
of the Indian community rising rapidly. The officers of the Asiatic
Department were diligent readers of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>.
Secrecy had been deliberately ruled out of the movement. <i>Indian
</i><i>Opinion </i>was an open book to whoever wanted to gauge the
strength and the weakness of the community, be he a friend, an enemy
or a neutral. The workers had realized at the very outset that
secrecy had no place in a movement where one could do no wrong, where
there was no scope for duplicity or cunning, and where strength
constituted the single guarantee of victory. The very interest of the
community demanded that if the disease of weakness was to be
eradicated, it must be first properly diagnosed and given due
publicity. When the officers saw that this was the policy of <i>Indian
</i><i>Opinion, </i>the paper became for them a faithful mirror of
the current history of the Indian community. They thus came to think
the strength of the movement could not by any means be broken so long
as certain leaders were at large. Some of the leading men were
consequently served with a notice in the Christmas week of 1907 to
appear before the Magistrate. It must be admitted that this was an
act of courtesy on the part of the officers concerned. They could
havearrested the leaders by warrant if they had chosen to do so.
Instead they issued notices and this, besides being evidence of their
courtesy, also showed their confidence that  the leaders were willing
and prepared to be arrested. Those who had thus been warned appeared
before the Court on the date  specified, Saturday, December 28, 1907,
to show cause why, having failed to apply for registration as
required by law, they should not be ordered to leave the Transvaal
within a given period.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

Chinese are. The modern progress of agriculture in America  and 
other countries defies description, but I consider it to be still in
an experimental stage. China, on the other hand, is an old country
like India and a comparison between India and China would be
therefore fairly instructive. I observed the agricultural methods of
the Chinese in Johannesburg and also talked with them on the subject,
and this gave me the impression that the Chinese are more intelligent
as well as diligent than we are. We often allow land to lie fallow
thinking it is of no use, while the Chinese would grow good crops
upon it, thanks to their minute knowledge of varying soils.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
The Black Act applied to the Chinese as well as to the Indians whom
they therefore joined in the satyagraha struggle. Still from first to
last the activities of the two communities were not allowed to be
mixed up. Each worked through its own independent organization. This
arrangement produced the beneficent result that so long as both the
communities stood to their guns, each would be a source of strength
to the other. But if one of the two gave way, that could leave the
morale of the other unaffected or at least the other would steer
clear of the danger of a total collapse. Many of the Chinese
eventually fell away as their leader played them false. He did not
indeed submit to the obnoxious law, but one morning someone came and
told me that the Chinese leader had fled away without handing over
charge of the books and moneys of the Chinese Association in his
possession. It is always difficult for followers to sustain a
conflict in the absenceof their leader, and the shock is all the
greater when the leader has disgraced himself. But when the arrests
commenced, the Chinese were in high spirits. Hardly any of them had
taken out a permit, and therefore their leader Mr. Quinn was warned
to appear along with the Indians. For some time at any rate Mr. Quinn
put in very useful work.  I would like to introduce to the reader one
out of the several leading Indians who constituted the first batch of
prisoners, Shri Thambi Naidoo. Thambi Naidoo was a Tamilian born in
Mauritius where his parents had migrated from Madras State. He was an
ordinary trader. He had received practically no school education
whatever. But a wide experience had been his schoolmaster. He spoke
and wrote English very well, although his grammar was not perhaps
free from faults. In the same way he had acquired a knowledge of
Tamil. He understood and spoke Hindustani fairly well and he had some
knowledge of Telugu too, though he did not know the alphabets of
these languages.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Again, he had a very good knowledge of the Creole dialect current in
Mauritius which is a sort of corrupt French, and he knew of course
the language of the Negroes. A working knowledge of  so  many
languages was not a rare accomplishment among the Indians of South
Africa, hundreds of whom could claim a general acquaintance with all
these languages. These men become such good  linguists almost without
effort. And that is because their brains are not fatigued by
education received through the medium of a foreign tongue, their
memory is sharp, and they acquire these different languages simply by
talking with people who speak them and by observation. This does not
involve any considerable strain on their brains but on the other hand
the easy mental exercise leads to a natural development of their
intellect. Such was the case with Thambi Naidoo. He had a very keen
intelligence and could grasp new subjects very quickly. His everyday
wit was astonishing. He had never seen India. Yet his love for the
homeland knew no bounds. Patriotism ran through his very veins. His
firmness was pictured on his face. He was very strongly built and
possessed tireless energy. He shone equally whether he had to take
the chair at meetings and lead them, or whether he had to do porter’s
work. He was not ashamed of carrying a load on the public roads.
Night and day were the same to him when he set to work. And none was
more ready than he to sacrifice his all for the sake of the
community. If Thambi Naidoo had not been rash and if he had been free
from anger, this brave man could easily have assumed theleadership of
the community in the Transvaal in the absence of Kachhalia. His
irritability had not still worked for evil while the Transvaal
struggle lasted, and his invaluable qualities had shone forth like
jewels. But, later on I heard that his anger and his rashness had
proved to be his worst enemies, and eclipsed his good  qualities.
However that may be, the name of Thambi Naidoo must ever remain as
one of the front rank in the history of satyagraha in South Africa.</p>

I asked leave to make a short statement, and on its  being granted, I
said I thought there should be a distinction made between my case and
those that were to follow. I had just heard from Pretoria that my
compatriots there had been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment
with hard labour, and had been fined a heavy amount, in lieu of
payment of which they would receive a further period of three months’
hard labour. If these men had committed an offence, I had committed a
greater offence and I therefore asked the Magistrate to impose upon
me the heaviest penalty. The Magistrate, however, did not agree to my
request and sentenced me to two months’ simple imprisonment. I had
some slight feeling of awkwardness due to the fact that I was
standing as an accused in the very Court where I had often appeared
as counsel. But I well remember that I considered the former role as
far more honourable than the latter, and did not feel the slightest
hesitation in entering the prisoner’s box.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
In the Court there were hundreds of Indians as well as brother
members of the Bar in front of me. On the sentence being pronounced I
was at once removed in custody and was then quite alone. The
policeman asked me to sit on a bench kept there for prisoners, shut
the door on me and went away. I was  somewhat  agitated and fell into
deep thought. Home, the  courts  where  I practised, the public
meeting,—all these passed away like a dream, and   I was now a
prisoner. What would happen in two months? Would I have to serve the
full term? If the people courted imprisonment in large numbers, as
they had promised, there would be no question of serving the full
sentence. But if they failed to fill the prisons, two months would be
as tedious as an age. These thoughts passed through my mind in less
than one hundredth of the time that it has taken me to dictate them.
And they filled me with shame. How vain I was! I, who had asked the
people to consider the prisons as His Majesty’s hotels, the
suffering consequent upon disobeying the Black Act as perfect bliss,
and the sacrifice of one’s all and of life itself in resisting it
as supreme enjoyment! Where had all this knowledge vanished today?
This second train of thought acted upon me as a bracing tonic, and I
began to laugh at my own folly. I began to think what kind of
imprisonment would be awarded to the others and whether they would be
kept with me in the prison. But I was disturbed by the police</p>

officer who opened the gate and asked me to follow him, which I did.
He then made me go before him, following me himself, took me to the
prisoners’ closed van and asked me to take my seat in it. I was
driven to Johannesburg jail.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

In jail I was asked to put off my own private clothing. I knew that
convicts were made naked in jail. We had all decided  as satyagrahis
voluntarily to obey all jail regulations so long as they were not
inconsistent with our self-respect or with our religious convictions.
The clothes which were given to me to wear were very dirty. I did not
like putting them on at all. It was not without pain that I
reconciled myself to them from an idea that I must put up with some
dirt. After the officers had recorded my name and address, I was
taken to a large cell, and in a short time was joined by my
compatriots who came laughing and told me how they had received the
same sentence as myself, and what took place after I had been
removed. I understood from them that when my case was over, the
Indians, some of whom were excited, took out a procession with black
flags in their hands. The police disturbed the procession and flogged
some of its members. We were all happy at the thought that we were
kept in the same jail and in the same cell.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
The cell door was locked at 6 o’clock. The door was not made of
bars but was quite solid, there being high up in the wall asmall
aperture for ventilation, so that we felt as if we had been locked up
in a safe. No wonder the jail authorities did not accord us the good
treatment which they had meted out to Rama Sundara. As Rama Sundara
was the first satyagrahi prisoner, the authorities had no idea how he
should be treated. Our batch was fairly large and further arrests
were in contemplation. We were therefore kept in the Negro ward. In
South Africa only two classes of convicts are recognized, namely,
Whites and Blacks, i.e., the Negroes, and the Indians were classed
with Negroes.</p>

we informed the authorities accordingly. We were therefore given the
clothes assigned to Negro convicts not punished with hard labour. But
Negro prisoners sentenced to simple imprisonment are never numerous,
and hence there was a shortage of simple imprisonment prisoners’
clothing as soon as other Indians sentenced to simple imprisonment
began to arrive! As the Indians did not wish to stand upon ceremony
in this matter, they readily accepted clothing assigned to hard
labour prisoners. Some of those who came in later preferred to keep
on their own clothing rather than put on the uniform of the hard
labour convicts. I thought this improper, but did not care to insist
upon their following the correct procedure in the matter.</p>

From the second or third day satyagrahi prisoners began to arrive in
large numbers. They had all courted arrest and were most of them
hawkers. In South Africa every hawker, Black or White, has to take
out a licence, always to carry it with him and show it to the police
when asked to do so. Nearly every day some policeman would ask to see
the licences and arrest those who had none to show.  The community
had resolved to fill up the jail after our arrests. In this the
hawkers took the lead. It was easy for them to get arrested. They had
only to refuse to show their licences and that was enough to ensure
their arrest. In this way the number of satyagrahi prisoners swelled
to more than a hundred in one week. And as a few were sure to arrive
every day, we received the daily budget of news without a newspaper.
When satyagrahis began to be arrested in large numbers, they were
sentenced to imprisonment with hard labour, either because the
magistrates lost patience, or because, as we thought, they had
received some such instructions from the Government. Even today, I
think we were right in our conjecture, as, if we leave out the first
few cases in which simple imprisonment was awarded, never afterwards
throughout the long-drawn-out struggle was there pronounced a
sentence of simple imprisonment, even women having been punished with
hard labour. If all the magistrates had not received the same orders
or instructions, and if yet by mere coincidence they sentenced all
men and women at all times to hard labour, that must be held to be
almost  a miracle.</p>

In Johannesburg jail prisoners not condemned to hard labour got
‘mealie pap’ in the morning. There was no salt in it, but each
prisoner was given some salt separately. At noon the prisoners were
given four ounces of rice, four ounces of bread, one ounce of ghee
and a little salt, and in the evening ‘mealie pap’ and some
vegetable,</p>

chiefly potatoes of which two were given if they were small and only
one if they were big in size. None of us were satisfied with this
diet. The rice was cooked soft. We asked the prison medical officer
for some condiments, and told him that condiments were allowed in
jails in India. “This is not India,” was the stern answer. “There
is no question of taste about prison diet<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
condiments therefore cannot be allowed.” We asked for pulses on the
ground that the regulation diet was lacking in muscle-building
properties. “Prisoners must not indulge in arguments on medical
grounds,” replied the doctor. “You do get muscle-building food,
as twice a week you are served boiled beans instead of maize.” The
doctor’s argument was sound if the human stomach was capable of
extracting the various elements out of various foods taken at various
times in a week or fortnight. As a matter of fact he had no intention
whatever of looking to our convenience. The Superintendent permitted
us to cook our food ourselves. We elected Thambi Naidoo as our <i>chef,
</i>and as such he had to fight many a battle on our behalf. If the
vegetable ration issued was short in weight, he would insist on
getting full weight.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>On vegetable days which were two in a week we cooked
twice and on other days only once, as we were allowed to cook other
things for ourselves only for the noon-day meal. We were somewhat
better off after we began to cook our own food.</p>

But whether or not we succeeded in obtaining these conveniences,
every one of us was firm in his resolution of passing his term in
jail in perfect happiness and peace. The number of satyagrahi
prisoners gradually rose to over 150.  As we were all simple
imprisonment convicts, we had no work to do except keeping the cells,
etc., clean. We asked the Superintendent for work, and he replied: “I
am sorry I cannot give you work, as, if I did, I should be held to
have committed an offence. But you can devote as much time as you
please to keeping the place clean.” We asked for some such exercise
as drill, as we had observed even the Negro prisoners with hard
labour being drilled in addition to their usual work. The
Superintendent replied, “If your warder has time and if he gives
you drill, I will not object to it; but I will not require him to do
it, as he is hard worked as it is, and your arrival in unexpectedly
large numbers has made his work harder still.” The warder was a
good man and this qualified permission was quite enough for him. He
began to drill us every morning with great interest. This drill must

We had thus been in jail for a fortnight, when fresh arrivals brought
the news that there were going on some negotiations about a
compromise with the Government. After two or three days<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>Mr. Albert Cartwright, editor of <i>The Transvaal

All the daily papers then conducted in Johannesburg were the property
of one or another of the European owners of the gold mines, but
except in cases where the interests of these magnates were at stake,
the editors were unfettered in the expression of their own views on
all public questions. Only very able and well-known men were selected
as editors. For instance, the editor of <i>The </i><i>Daily </i><i>Star
</i>had formerly been Private Secretary to Lord Milner, and later
went to England to take Mr.Buckle’s place as editor of <i>The
</i><i>Times</i>. Mr. Albert Cartwright of <i>The </i><i>Transvaal
Leader </i>was as broad-minded as he was able. He had almost always
supported the Indian cause in his columns. He and I had become good
friends. He saw General Smuts after I was sent to jail. General Smuts
welcomed his mediation.  Mr. Cartwright thereupon met the Indian
leaders, who said, “We know nothing about legal technicalities, and
cannot possibly talk about compromise so long as Gandhi is in prison.
We desire settlement, but if Government wants it while our men are in
jail, you should see Gandhi. We will ratify any arrangement which he
accepts.”</p>

Mr. Cartwright thus came to see me and brought with him terms of
settlement drafted or approved of by General Smuts. I did not like
the vague language of the document, but was all the same prepared
myself to put my signature to it with one alteration. However, I
informed Mr. Cartwright that I could not sign it without consulting
my fellow-prisoners, even if I took the consent of the Indians
outside prison for granted.</p>

The substance of the proposed settlement was that the Indians should
register voluntarily and not under any law, that the details to be
entered in the new certificates of registration should be settled by
Government in consultation with the Indian community, and that if the
majority of the Indians underwent voluntary registration, Government
should repeal the Black Act and take steps with a view to legalizing
the voluntary registration. The draft did not make quite clear the
condition which required Government to repeal the Black Act. I
therefore suggested a change calculated to place this beyond all
doubt from my own standpoint.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Mr. Cartwright did not like even this little addition and said,
“General Smuts considers this draft to be final. I have approved of
it myself, and I can assure you that if you all undergo
re-registration, the Black Act is bound to be repealed.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I replied, “Whether or not there is a settlement, we shall always
be grateful to you for your kindness and help. I should not like to
suggest a single unnecessary alteration in the draft. I do not object
to such language as would uphold the prestige of Government. But 
where I myself am doubtful about the meaning, I must certainly
suggest a change of language, and if there is to be a settlement
after all, both the parties must have the right to alter the draft.
General Smuts need not confront us with an ultimatum, saying that
these terms are final. He has already aimed one pistol in the shape
of the Black Act at the Indians. What can he hope to gain by aiming a
second?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Mr. Cartwright had nothing to say against this argument, and he

I consulted my fellow-prisoners. They too did not like the language,
but agreed to the settlement if General Smuts would accept the draft
with my amendment. New-comers to jail had brought a message from the
leaders outside that I should accept any suitable compromise without
waiting for their consent. I got Messrs Leung Quinn and Thambi Naidoo
to sign the draft along with myself and handed it to Mr. Cartwright.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup></p>

Superintendent of Police, Johannesburg, took me to Pretoria to meet
General Smuts, with whom I had a good deal of talk. He told me what
had passed between him and Mr. Cartwright. He congratulated me on the
Indian community having remained firm even after my imprisonment, and
said, “I could never entertain a dislike for your people. You know
I too am a barrister. I had some Indian fellow-students in my time.
But I must do my duty. The Europeans want this law, and you will
agree with me that these are mostly not Boers but Englishmen. I
accept the alteration you have suggested in the draft. I have
consulted General Botha also, and I assure you that I will repeal the
Asiatic Act as soon as most of you have undergone voluntary
registration. When the bill legalizing such registration is drafted,
I will send you a copy for your criticism. I do not wish there should
be any recurrence of the trouble, and I wish to respect the feelings
of your people.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.01cm">So
saying General Smuts rose. I asked him, “Where am I to go?</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.01cm">And what about the
other prisoners?”</p>

The General laughed and said, “You are free this very moment.  I am
’phoning to the prison officials to release the other prisoners
tomorrow morning. But I must advise you not to go in for many
meetings or demonstrations, as in that case Government will find
itself in an awkward position.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I replied, “You may rest assured that there will not be a single
meeting simply for the sake of it. But I will certainly have to hold
meetings in order to explain to the community how the settlement was
effected, what is its nature and scope, and how it has added to our
responsibilities.” “Of such meetings,” said General  Smuts, 
“you may have as many as you please. It is sufficient that you have
understood what I desire in the matter.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

It was then about seven o’clock in the evening. I had not a single
farthing in my pocket. The secretary to General Smuts gave me the
railway fare to Johannesburg. There was no need to  stop  at Pretoria
and announce the settlement to the Indians there. The leaders were
all in Johannesburg, which was our headquarters. There was now only
one more train for Johannesburg, and I was able to catch it.</p>

meetings were usually held on the grounds of the mosque. There was
hence not much to be done by way of arrangement for the meeting. It
was enough to have one light on the platform. The meeting was held

Before the meeting was held, I had explained the terms of the
settlement to the leaders present. A few opposed the settlement. But
all of them understood the situation after they had heard me. Every
one of them, however, was troubled by one doubt, ‘What if General
Smuts broke faith with us? The Black Act might not be enforced but it
would always hang over our heads like the sword of Damocles. If in
the meanwhile we registered voluntarily, we would have
knowinglyplayed in the adversary’s hands and surrendered the most
powerful weapon in our possession for resisting the Act. The right
order for the  settlement was that the Act should be repealed first
and then we should be called upon to register voluntarily.’</p>

I liked this argument. I felt proud of the keen common sense and high
courage of those who advanced it and saw that such was the stuff of
which satyagrahis were made. In answer to that argument I observed:
“It is an excellent argument and deserves serious consideration.

voluntarily only after the Act was repealed. But then it would not be
in the nature of a compromise. Compromise means that both the parties
make large concessions on all points except where a principle is
involved. Our principle is that we would not submit to the Black Act,
and therefore, would not, in virtue of it, do even such things as
were otherwise unobjectionable; and to this principle we must adhere
at all costs. The principle with the Government is that in order to
prevent the illegal entry of Indians into the Transvaal, it must get 
many  Indians to take out non-transferable permits with marks of
identification and thus set the suspicions of the Europeans at rest
and allay all their fears; and the Government can never give it up on
its part. We have admitted this principle of the Government by our
conduct up to date, and therefore even if we feel like resisting it
we may not do so until we find fresh grounds for such a departure.
Our struggle aimed not at the abrogation of this principle but at
removing the stigma which the Black Act sought to attach to the
community. If, therefore, we now utilize the new and powerful force
which has sprung up in the community for gaining a fresh point, it
would ill become us, who claim to be satyagrahis. Consequently, we
cannot justly object to the present settlement. As for the argument
that we must not surrender our weapons before the Act is repealed, it
is easily answered. A satyagrahi bids goodbye to fear. He is
therefore never afraid  of trusting the opponent. Even if the
opponent plays him false twenty times, the satyagrahi is ready to
trust him for the twenty-first time, for an implicit trust in human
nature is the very essence of his creed. Again, to say that in
trusting the Government we play into its hands is to betray an
ignorance of the principles of satyagraha. Suppose we register
voluntarily, but the Government commits a breach of faith and fails
to redeem its promise to repeal the Act. Could we not then resort to
satyagraha? If we refused to show at the-proper time thecertificates
of registration we take out, our registration would count for
nothing, and Government could not distinguish between ourselves and
the Indians who might enter the Transvaal surreptitiously. Therefore,
whether there is or there is not any law in force, the Government
cannot exercise control over us without our co-operation. The
existence of a law means that if we refuse to accept the restriction
sought to be imposed through it by the Government, we are liable to
punishment, and generally it so happens that the fear of punishment
leads men to submit to the restriction. But a satyagrahi differs from
the generality of men in this, that if he submits to a restriction,
he</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
submits voluntarily, not because he is afraid of punishment but
because he thinks that such submission is essential to the common
weal. And such is precisely our position regarding registration,
which cannot be affected by any breach of faith, however flagrant, on
the part of the Government. We are the creators of this position of
ours, and we alone can change it. We are fearless and free, so long
as we have the weapon of satyagraha in our hands. And if anyone
thinks that the community may not be as strong afterwards as it is
today, I should say that he is not a satyagrahi nor has he any
understanding of satyagraha. That would mean that the present
strength of the community is not real strength but is in the nature
of a momentary effervescence or intoxication, and if that is so, we
do not deserve to win, and the fruits of victory will slip out of our
hands even if we win. Suppose the Government first abrogates the Act
and we then register voluntarily. Suppose further that the Government
afterwards enacts the same obnoxious law and compels the Indians to
register. What can then prevent the Government from pursuing such a
course of action? And if we are doubtful about our strength today,
then too shall we be in an equally bad case. From whatever
standpoint, therefore, we examine the settlement, it may be said that
the community not only will not lose but will on the other hand gain
by the compromise. And   I am also of opinion that when our opponents
recognize our humility and sense of justice, they would give up or at
least mitigate their opposition.”</p>

I was thus able fully to satisfy the one or two of the small company
who struck a discordant note, but I did not then even dream of the
storm which was to break out at the midnight meeting. I explained all
the terms of the settlement to the meeting and said:  “The
responsibility of the community is greatly enhanced by this
settlement.  We  must  register  voluntarily   in   order   to   show
  that we do not intend to bring a single Indian into the Transvaal
surreptitiously or by fraud. If any one of us fails to register, he
will not be punished at present; but that can only  mean  that  the
community does not accept the settlement. It is necessary, indeed,
that you must here raise your hands as a mark of your agreeing to the
settlement, but that is not enough. As soon as the arrangements for
fresh registration are completed, every one of us who raises his hand
should take out a certificate of registration at once, and just as
many</p>

of you had volunteered before in order to explain to our compatriots
why they should not register, even so should you now come forward to
explain to the community why they must register. And it is only when
we have thus worthily fulfilled our part that we shall reap the real
fruit of our victory.”</p>

As soon as I finished my speech a Pathan friend stood up and greeted
me with a volley of questions:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.1cm">“Shall we have to give
ten finger-prints under the settlement?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 102%">
“Yes and no. My own view of the matter is that all of us should
give digit impressions without the least hesitation. But those who
have any conscientious objection to giving them or think it to be
derogatory to their self-respect will not be obliged to give those
impressions.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.1cm">“What
will you do yourself?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 102%">
“I have decided to give ten finger-prints. It may not be for me not
to give them myself while advising others to do so.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
“You were writing a deal about the ten finger-prints. It was you
who told us that they were required only from criminals. It was you
who said that the struggle centred round the finger-prints. How does
all that fit in with your attitude today?”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
“Even now I fully adhere to everything that I have written  before
about finger-prints. Even now I say that in India fingerprints are
required from criminal tribes. I have said before and say even now
that it would be a sin in virtue of the Black Act to give even our
signatures, not to talk of finger-prints. It is true that I have,—and
I believe wisely,—laid great stress on this requisition of
finger-prints. It was easier to rouse the community to a sense of the
gravity of the situation by a reference to such a new and startling
feature of the Act as the finger-prints than to minor items in which
we had already yielded submission. And I saw from experience that the
community grasped the situation at once. But circumstances have now
changed. I say with all the force at my command, that what would have
been a crime against the people yesterday is in the altered
circumstances of today the hallmark of a gentleman. If you require me
to salute you by force and if I submit to you, I will have demeaned
myself in the eyes of the public and in your eyes as well as in my
own. But if I of my own accord salute you as a brother or fellow-man,
that evinces my humility and gentlemanliness, and it will be counted
to me as righteousness before the Great White Throne. That is how I
advise the</p>

“We have heard that you have betrayed the community and sold it to
General Smuts for £15,000. We will never give the finger-prints nor
allow others to do so. I swear with Allah as my witness that I will
kill the man who takes the lead in applying for registration.”</p>

“I can understand the feelings of Pathan friends. I am sure that no
one else<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>believes
me to be capable of selling the community. I have already said that
finger-prints will not be demanded from those who have sworn not to
give them. I will render all possible help to any Pathan or any other
person who wishes to register without giving finger-prints, and I
assure him that he will get the certificate all right without
violence being done to his conscience. I must confess, however, that
I do not like the threat of death which the friend has held out. I
also believe that one may not swear to kill another in the name of
the Most High. I therefore take it that it is only in  a momentary
fit of passion that this friend has taken the oath. However that may
be, whether or not he carries out his threat, as the principal party
responsible for this settlement and as a servant  of  the community,
it is my clear duty to take the lead in giving finger-prints, and I
pray to God that He graciously permit me to do so. Death is the
appointed end of all life. To die by the hand of a brother, rather
than by disease or in some such way, cannot be for me a matter for
sorrow. And if even in such a case I am free from the thoughts of
anger or hatred against my assailant, I know that that will redound 
to  my eternal welfare, and even the assailant will later on realize
my perfect innocence.”</p>

It is perhaps necessary to explain why these questions were asked.
Although there were not entertained any feelings of hatred against
those who had submitted to the Black Act, their action had been
condemned in plain and strong terms on the public platform as well as
in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>. Life with them therefore was
anything but pleasant. They never imagined that the bulk of the
community would stand to their guns and make such a display of
strength as to bring’ the Government to terms of compromise. But

There were only a few Pathans living in the Transvaal, their total
number hardly exceeding fifty. Some of them had come over as soldiers
during the Boer War and they had settled in the country like many
other Indian as well as European soldiers. Some of them were even my
clients, and I was familiar with them otherwise too. The Pathans are
an unsophisticated and credulous race. Brave they are as a matter of
course. To kill and get killed is an ordinary thing in their eyes,
and if they are angry with anyone, they will thrash him and sometimes
even kill him. And in this matter they are no respecters of persons.
They will behave even to a blood-brother in an identical manner. Even
though there were so few of them in the Transvaal, there would be a
free fight whenever they quarrelled among themselves, and in such
cases I had often to play the part of a peacemaker. A Pathan’s
anger becomes particularly uncontrollable when he has to deal with
anyone whom he takes to be a traitor. When he seeks justice he seeks
it only through personal violence. These Pathans fully participated
in the satyagraha struggle; none of them had submitted to the Black
Act. It was an easy thing to mislead them. It was quite possible to
create a misunderstanding in their minds about the finger-prints and
thus to inflame them. This single suggestion,— viz., why should I
ask them to give finger-prints if I was not corrupt?—was enough to
poison the Pathan’s ears.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Again, there was another party in the Transvaal which comprised such
Indians as had entered the Transvaal surreptitiously without a permit
or were interested in bringing others there secretly  either without
a permit at all or with a false permit. This party too knew that the
settlement would be detrimental to their interest. None had to
produce his permit so long as the struggle lasted, and therefore this
group could carry on their trade without fear and easily avoid going
to jail during the struggle. The longer the struggle was protracted,
the better for them. Thus this clique also could have instigated  the
 Pathans. The reader will now see how the Pathans got excited thus
all of a sudden.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
The Pathan’s questions, however, did not make any impression on the
meeting. I had asked the meeting to vote on the settlement. The
president and other leaders were firm. After this passage-at-arms
with the Pathan, the president made a speech explainingthe nature of
the settlement and dwelling upon the necessity for endorsing it, and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
then proceeded to ascertain the sense of the meeting, which
unanimously ratified the settlement with the exception of a couple of
Pathans present.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I reached home at 2 or 3 a.m. Sleep was out of the question, as I had
to rise early and go to the jail to get the others released. I
reached the jail at 7 a.m. The Superintendent had  received  the 
necessary orders on the ’phone, and he was waiting for me. All the
satyagrahi prisoners were released in the course of one hour. The
chairman and other Indians were present to welcome them, and from
jail all of us proceeded to the place of meeting where a second
meeting was now held. That day and a couple of subsequent days were
passed  in feasting and educating the community on the settlement.
With the lapse of time, if on the one hand the implications of the
settlement became clearer, misunderstandings on the other hand also
began to thicken. We have already discussed the chief causes of
misunderstanding. Then again the letter we had written to General
Smuts was open to misrepresentation. The difficulty I experienced in
meeting the various objections which were thus raised was infinitely
greater than what I had felt while the struggle was actually in
progress. In the days of struggle, the only difficulties felt to crop
up are in our relations with the adversary, and these are always
easily overcome, for then all internecine strife and internal discord
are either suspended altogether or, at least, they lose their
prominence in face of the common danger. But when the fight is over,
internal jealousies are again fully in play, and if the differences
with the adversary have been amicably settled, many take to the easy
and grateful task of picking holes in the settlement. And in a
democratic body it is only in the fitness of things that one has to
provide satisfactory answers for the questions of everyone, big and
small. Even in offering battle to the adversary one does not learn
the valuable lessons which come home to oneself while thus dealing
with misunderstandings and strivings between friends. There is a sort
of intoxication and exultation in fighting the adversary. But
misunderstandings and differences  between friends are rare phenomena
and are therefore all the more painful. Yet it is only on such
occasions that one’s mettle is put to a real test. Such without any
exception has been my experience and I believe that it is only when
passing through such ordeals that I have made the largest gains in
things of the spirit. Many who had not understood the real nature of
the struggle while it was still going on understood it fully in the
course of and after the settlement. Serious</p>

The Registrar of Asiatics was soon ready to issue registration
certificates under the new voluntary arrangement. The form of the
certificates was altogether changed, and had been settled in
consultation with the satyagrahis.</p>

On the morning of February 10, 1908, some of us got ready to go and
take out certificates of registration. The supreme necessity of
getting through the registration business with all possible
expedition had been fully impressed on the community, and it had been
agreed that the leaders should be the first to take out certificates
on the first day, so as to break down shyness, to see if the officers
concerned discharged their duties with courtesy and generally to have
an eye over all the arrangements.</p>

When I reached my office, which was also the office of the Satyagraha
Association, I found Mir Alam and his companions standing outside the
premises. Mir Alam was an old client of mine, and used to seek my
advice in all his affairs. Many Pathans in the Transvaal employed
labourers to manufacture straw or coir mattresses, which they sold at
a good profit, and Mir Alam did the same. He was fully six feet in
height and of a large and powerful build. Today for the first time I
saw Mir Alam outside my office instead of inside it, and although his
eyes met mine, he for the first time refrained from saluting me. But
I saluted him and he saluted me in return. As usual I asked him, “How
do you do?” and my impression is that he said he was all right. But
he did not today wear his usual smile on the face. I noticed his
angry eyes and made a mental note of the fact. I thought that
something was going to happen. I entered the office. The Chairman Mr.
Yusuf Mian and other friends arrived, and we set out for the Asiatic
Office. Mir Alam and his companions followed us.</p>

The Registration Office was at Von Brandis Square, less than a mile
away from my office. On our way to it we had to pass through high
roads. As we were going along Von Brandis Street, outside the
premises of Messrs Arnot and Gibson, not more than three minutes’
walk from the Registration Office, Mir Alam accosted me and asked me,
“Where are you going?”</p>

I had scarcely finished the last sentence when a heavy cudgel blow
descended on my head from behind. I at once fainted with the words <i>He
</i><i>Rama </i>(O God!) on my lips, lay prostrate on the ground and
had no notion of what followed. But Mir Alam and his companions gave
me-more blows and kicks, some of which were warded off by Yusuf Mian
and Thambi Naidoo with the result that they too became a target for
attack in their turn. The noise attracted some European passers-by to
the scene. Mir Alam and his companions fled but were caught by the
Europeans. The police arrived in the meanwhile and took them in
custody. I was picked up and carried into Mr. J. C. Gibson’s
private office. When I regained consciousness, I saw Mr. Doke bending
over me. “How do you feel?” he asked me.</p>

Mr. Chamney, the Registrar of Asiatics, too now arrived on the scene.
 I was taken in a carriage to this good clergyman’s residence in
Smit Street and a doctor was called in. Meanwhile I said to Mr.
Chamney: “I wished to come to your office, give ten finger-prints
and take out the first certificate of registration, but God willed it
otherwise. However I have now to request you to bring the papers and
allow me to register at once. I hope that you will not let anyone
else register before me.”</p>

will issue certificates to others but keep your name at the head of
the list.”</p>

“Not so,” I replied. “I am pledged to take out the  first
certificate if I am alive and if it is acceptable to God. It is
therefore that I insist upon the papers being brought here and now.”</p>

The next thing for me to do was to wire to the Attorney-General that
I did not hold Mir Alam and others guilty for the assault committed
upon me, that in any case I did not wish them to be prosecuted and
that I hoped they would be discharged formy sake.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
</font></sup>But the Europeans of Johannesburg addressed a strong
letter to the Attorney-General saying that whatever views Gandhi
might hold as regards the punishment of criminals, they could not be
given effect to in South Africa. Gandhi himself might not take any
steps, but the assault was committed not in a private place but on
the high roads and was therefore a public offence. Several Englishmen
too were in a position to tender evidence and the offenders must be
prosecuted. Upon this the Attorney-General re-arrested Mir Alam and
one of his companions who were sentenced to three months’ hard
labour. Only I was not summoned as a witness.</p>

But let us return to the sick room. Dr. Thwaites came in while Mr.
Chamney was still away. He examined me and stitched up the wounds in
the cheek and on the upper lip. He prescribed some medicine to be
applied to the ribs and enjoined silence upon me so long as the
stitches were not removed. He restricted my diet to liquids only. He
said that none of the injuries was serious, that I should be able to
leave my bed and take up my ordinary activities in a week, but that I
should be careful not to undertake much physical strain for two
months more. So saying he left.</p>

react in a manner prejudicial to my health. They, therefore, by
making signs and similar devices, removed all persons from near my

Mr. Joseph Doke was a Baptist minister then 46 years old and had been
in New Zealand before he came to South Africa. Some six months before
this assault, he came to my office and sent in his card. On seeing
the word ‘Reverend’ before his name, I wrongly imagined that he
had come, as some other clergymen did, to convert me to Christianity
or to advise me to give up the struggle or perhaps to express
patronizing sympathy with the movement. Mr. Doke entered, and we had
not talked many minutes before I saw how sadly I had misjudged him
and mentally apologized to him. I found him familiar with all the
facts of the struggle which were published in newspapers. He said,
“Please consider me as your friend in this struggle.  I  consider
it my religious duty to render you such help as I can. If I have
learnt any lesson from the life of Jesus, it is this that one should
share and lighten the load of those who are heavily laden.” We thus
got acquainted with each other, and every day marked an advance in
our mutual affection and intimacy. The name of Mr. Doke will often
recur in the course of the present volume, but it was necessary to
say a few words by way of introducing him to the reader before I
describe the delicate attention I received at the hands of the Dokes.</p>

there. All classes of Indians flocked to the place to inquire after
my health, and, when later permitted by the doctor, to see me— from
the humble hawker basket in hand, with dirty clothes and dusty boots,
right up to the Chairman of the Transvaal British Indian Association.
Mr. Doke would receive all of them in his drawing-room</p>

with uniform courtesy and consideration, and so long as I lived with
the Dokes, all their time was occupied either with nursing me or with
receiving the hundreds of people who looked in to see me. Even at
night Mr. Doke would quietly peep twice or thrice into my room. While

And it must not be supposed that Mr. Doke had not to suffer for
according public support to the Indians in their struggle and for
harbouring me under his roof. Mr. Doke was in charge of a Baptist
church, and depended for his livelihood upon a congregation of
Europeans, not all of whom entertained liberal views  and  among whom
dislike of the Indians was perhaps as general as among other
Europeans. But Mr. Doke was unmoved by it. I had discussed this
delicate subject with him in the very beginning of our acquaintance.
And he said, “My dear friend, what do you think of the religion of
Jesus? I claim to be a humble follower of Him  who  cheerfully 
mounted the Cross for the faith that was in Him, and whose love was
as wide as the world. I must take a public part in your struggle if I
am at all desirous of representing Christ to the Europeans who, you
are afraid, will give me up as punishment for it. And I must not
complain if they do thus give me up. My livelihood is indeed derived
from them, but you certainly do not think that I am associated with
them for living’s sake, or that they are my cherishers. My
cherisher is God; they are but the instruments of His almighty will.
It is one of the unwritten conditions of my connection with them that
none of them may interfere with my religious liberty. Please
therefore stop worrying on my account. I am taking my place beside
you in this struggle not to oblige the Indians but as a matter of
duty. The fact, however, is that  I have fully discussed this
question with my dean. I gently informed him that if he did not
approve of my relations with the Indians, he might permit me to
retire and engage another minister instead. But he not only asked me
not to trouble myself about it but even spoke some words of
encouragement. Again, you must not imagine that all Euro- peans alike
entertain hatred against your people. You can have no idea of the
silent sympathy of many with your tribulations, and you will agree
with me that I must know about it situated as I am.”</p>

And later on when Mr. Doke died in the pursuit of his holy calling in</p>

As the number of Europeans of position who actively sided with the
Indians in their struggle was fairly large, it will not perhaps be
out of place to introduce them here to the reader all at once, so
that when their names occur later on in this narrative, they will not
be strangers to him, and I shall not have to stop in the midst of the
narrative in order to introduce them. The order in which the names
have been arranged is not the order of the merit of service rendered,
nor that of the public estimation in which the bearers of the names
were held. I mention the friends in order of the time when I got
acquainted with them and in connection with the various branches of
the struggle where they helped the Indians.</p>

The first name is that of Mr. Albert West, whose association with the
community dated from before the struggle and whose association with
me commenced earlier still. When I opened my office in Johannesburg
my wife was not with me. The reader will remember that in 1903 I
received a cable from South Africa and suddenly left India, expecting
to return home within a year. Mr. West used to frequent the
vegetarian restaurant in Johannesburg where I regularly had my meals
both morning and evening, and we thus became acquainted with each
other. He was then conducting a printing press in partnership with
another European. In 1904  a  virulent  plague broke out among the
Indians in Johannesburg. I was fully engaged in nursing the patients,
and my visits to the restaurant became irregular. Even when I did go,
I went there before the other guests in order to avoid any possible
danger to them from their coming in contact with me. Mr. West became
anxious when he did not find me there for two</p>

days in succession as he had read in the papers that I was attending
to the plague patients. The third day, at 6 o’clock in the morning
when I was scarcely ready to go out I heard a knock at my door. When
I opened it, I saw Mr. West with his beaming face.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 110%">
“I am so glad to see you,” he exclaimed. “I had been worrying
about you, not finding you at the restaurant. Do tell me if I can do
anything for you.” “Will you nurse the patients?” I asked
jocularly.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">“Why
not? I am quite ready.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
Meanwhile I had thought out my plans and said, “No other answer
could be expected of you, but there are already many helping with the
nursing, and besides I propose to put you to still harder work.
Madanjit is here on plague duty and there is no one to look after the
<i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>press. If you go to Durban and take
charge of the press it will be really a great help. I cannot of
course offer you any tempting terms. Ten pounds a month and half the
profits if any is all that I can afford.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
“That is rather a tough job. I must have my partner’s permission,
and then there are some dues to be collected. But never mind. Will
you wait till evening for my final answer?”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">“Yes,
we meet in the park at 6 o’clock.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 110%">
So we met. Mr. West had obtained his partner’s permission. He
entrusted me with the recovery of his dues, and left for Durban by
the evening train the next day. In a month I had his report that not
only was the press not profitable at all but it was actually a losing
concern. There were large arrears to be collected but the books had
been badly kept. Even the list of the names and addresses of
subscribers was incomplete. There was also mismanagement in other
respects. Mr. West did not write all this as a matter of complaint.
As he did not care for profit he assured me that he would not give up
what he had undertaken, but gave me clearly to understand that the
paper would not be paying its way for a long time to come.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
Shri Madanjit had come to Johannesburg to canvass subscribers for the
paper as well as to confer with me as regards the management of the
press. Every month I had to meet a small or large deficit, and I was
therefore desirous of having a more definite idea of my possible
liabilities. Madanjit had no experience of printing press business
and I</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
had been thinking since the beginning that it would be well  to 
associate a trained hand with him. The plague broke out in the
meantime, and as Madanjit was just the man for such a crisis, I put
him on to nursing. And I closed with West’s unexpected offer and
told him that he was to go not temporarily while the epidemic lasted
but for good. Hence his report on the prospects of the paper just
referred to.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
The reader knows how at last both the paper and the press were
removed to Phoenix, where West drew a monthly allowance of £3
instead of £10 as previously arranged. West was himself  fully
agreeable to all these changes. I never observed in him the
leastanxiety as to how he would be able to maintain himself. I
recognized in him a deeply religious spirit, although he was not a
student of religion. He was a man of perfectly independent
temperament. He would say what he thought of all things, and would
not hesitate to call a spade a spade. He was quite simple in habits.
He was unmarried when we first met, and I know that he lived a life
of spotless purity. Some years later he went to England to see his
parents and returned a married man. On my advice he brought with him
his wife, mother-in-law and unmarried sister, who all lived in
extreme simplicity and in every way fraternized with the Indians in
Phoenix. Miss Ada West (or Devi Behn as we used to call her) is now
35 years old, is still unmarried and leads a most pious life. She too
rendered to the pioneers at Phoenix services of no mean order. At one
time or another she looked after the little children, taught them 
English, cooked in the common kitchen, swept the houses, kept
accounts and did composing and other work in the press. Whatever task
came to her she never hesitated to do it. She is not now in Phoenix,
but that is because since my return to India the press has been
unable to meet even her small personal expenditure. West’s
mother-in-law is now over eighty years old. She is a fine hand at
sewing, and used to help the settlement with her skill in sewing.
Everyone in Phoenix called her Granny and felt that she was really
related so to them. I need scarcely say anything about Mrs. West.
When many members of the Phoenix settlement were in jail, the Wests,
along with Maganlal Gandhi, took over the whole management of the
institution. West would see to the press and the paper, and in the
absence of others and myself, dispatch</p>

to Gokhale the cables which were to be sent from Durban. When even
West was arrested (though he was soon released), Gokhale got nervous
and sent over Andrews and Pearson.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
Then there was Mr. Ritch, I have already written about him. He had
joined my office before the struggle and proceeded to England to
study for the bar with a view to filling my place when I was not
available. He was the moving spirit of the South Africa British
Indian Committee in London.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
The third was Mr. Polak, whose acquaintance like that of West I
casually made in the restaurant. He likewise left at once the
sub-editorship of <i>The </i><i>Transvaal </i><i>Critic </i>to join
the staff of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>. Everyone knows how he went
to India and to England in connection with the struggle. When Ritch
went to England, I called Polak from Phoenix to Johannesburg, where
he became myarticled clerk and then a full-fledged attorney. Later on
he married. People in India are familiar with Mrs. Polak, who not
only never came in her husband’s way but was a perfect helpmate to
him during the struggle. The Polaks did not see eye to eye with us in
the Non-co-operation movement, but they are still serving India to
the best of their ability.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 110%">
The next was Mr. Hermann Kallenbach, whom too I came to know before
the struggle. He is a German, and had it not been for the Great War,
he would be in India today. He is a man of strong feelings, wide
sympathies and childlike simplicity. He is an architect by
profession, but there is no work, however lowly, which he would
consider to be beneath his dignity. When I  broke  up  my
Johannesburg establishment, I lived with him but he would be hurt if
I offered to pay him my share of the household expenses, and would
plead that I was responsible for considerable savings in his domestic
economy. This was indeed true. But this is not the place to describe
my personal relations with European friends. When we thought of
accommodating the families of satyagrahi prisoners in Johannesburg in
one place, Kallenbach lent the use of his big farm<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>without
any rent. But more of that later. When Gokhale came to Johannesburg,
the community put him up at Kallenbach’s cottage which the
illustrious guest liked very much. Kallenbach went with me as far as
Zanzibar to</p>

see Gokhale off. He was arrested along with Polak and suffered
imprisonment. Finally, when I left South Africa to see Gokhale in
England, Kallenbach was with me. But when I returned to India, he was
not permitted to go with me to India on account of the War. He was,
like all other Germans, interned in England. When the War was over
Kallenbach returned to Johannesburg and recommenced the practice of
his profession.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
Let me now introduce the reader to a noble girl—I mean Miss Sonja
Schlesin. I cannot resist the temptation of placing  here  on record
Gokhale’s estimate of her character. He had  a  wonderful power of
judging men. I went with him from Delagoa Bay to Zanzibar, and the
voyage gave us a fine opportunity of quiet talks. Gokhale had come in
contact with the Indian and European leaders in South Africa. And
while minutely analysing for me the characters of the principal
persons of the drama, I perfectly remember that he gave the pride of
place among them all, Europeans as well as Indians, to Miss Schlesin:
“I have rarely come across such purity, single-minded devotion to
work and great determination as I have seen in Miss Schlesin. I was
simply astonished how she had sacrificed her all for the Indian cause
without expecting any reward whatever. And when you add to all this
her great ability and energy, these  qualities  combine to make her a
priceless asset to your movement. I need hardly say it and yet I say
that you must cherish her.” I had a Scottish girl, Miss Dick,
working with me as steno-typist, who was the very picture of loyalty
and purity.. Many a bitter experience has been my lot in life, but I
have also had the good fortune to claim a large number of Europeans
and Indians of high character as my associates. Miss Dick left me
when she married, and then Mr. Kallenbach introduced Miss Schlesin to
me and said, “This girl  has  been entrusted to me by her mother.
She is clever and honest, but she is very mischievous and impetuous.
Perhaps she is even insolent. You keep her if you can manage her. I
do not place her with you for the mere pay.” I was ready to allow
£20 a month to a good steno-typist, but I had no idea of Miss
Schlesin’s ability. Mr. Kallenbach proposed that I should pay her
£6 a month to begin with, and I readily agreed. Miss Schlesin soon
made me familiar with the mischievous part of herself. But in a
month’s time she had achieved the conquest of my</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
heart. She was ready to work at all times whether by day or by night.
There was nothing difficult or impossible for her. She was then only
sixteen years of age, but she captivated my clients as well as the
fellow-satyagrahis by her frankness and readiness to  serve.  This 
young girl soon constituted herself the watchman and warder of the
morality not only of my office but of the whole movement. Whenever
she was in doubt as to the ethical propriety of any proposed step,
she would freely discuss it with me and not rest till she was
convinced of it. When all the leaders except Sheth Kachhalia were in
jail, Miss Schlesin had control of large funds and was in charge of
the accounts. She handled workers of various temperaments. Even Sheth
Kachhalia would have recourse to her and seek her advice. Mr. Doke
was then in charge of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>. But even he,
hoary-headed veteran as he was, would get the articles he wrote for
<i>Indian Opinion </i>passed by her! And he once told me, “If Miss
Schlesin had not been there, I do not know how I could have satisfied
even my own self with my work.” I cannot sufficiently appreciate
the value of her assistance, and very often I have accepted the
corrections or additions she suggested knowing them to be
appropriate. Pathans, Patels, ex-indentured men, Indians of all
classes and ages surrounded her, sought her adviceand followed it.
Europeans in South Africa would generally never travel in the same
railway compartment as Indians, and in the Transvaal they are   even 
 prohibited   from   doing   so.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
     </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>Yet
  Miss   Schlesin    would deliberately sit in the third class
compartment for Indians like other satyagrahis and even resist the
guards who interfered with her. I feared and Miss Schlesin hoped that
she might be arrested some day. But although the Transvaal Government
were aware of her ability, her mastery over the ‘strategy’ of the
movement, and the hold she had acquired over the satyagrahis, they
adhered to the policy and the chivalry of not arresting her. Miss
Schlesin never asked for or desired an increase in her monthly
allowance of £6. I began giving her £10 when I came to know of some
of her wants. This too she accepted with reluctance, and flatly
declined to have anything more. “I do not need more, and if. I take
anything in excess of my necessities, I will have betrayed the
principle which has attracted me to you,” she would say,</p>

and silence me. The reader will perhaps ask what was Miss Schlesin’s
education. She had passed the Intermediate examination of the Cape
University, and obtained first class diploma in shorthand, etc. She
graduated after the struggle was over, and is now head mistress in a
Government Girls’ School in the Transvaal.</p>

The persons I have thus far mentioned were such as came in close
contact with me. They could not be classed among the leading
Europeans of the Transvaal. However, this latter class too was very
largely helpful, and the most influential of such helpers was Mr.
Hosken, ex-President of the Association of Chambers of Commerce of
South Africa and a member of the Legislative Assembly of the
Transvaal, whose acquaintance the reader has already made and who was
Chairman of the Committee of European sympathizers with the
satyagraha movement. When the movement was in full swing, direct
communications between satyagrahis and the local Government were
obviously out of the question,  not  because  of  any  objection on 
principle  on  the  part   of   the   satyagrahis   to   deal  
directly with the Government but because the latter  would  naturally
 not  confer with the breakers of its laws. And this Committee
actedas mediator between the Indians and the Government.</p>

I have already introduced Mr. Albert Cartwright to the reader. Then
there was the Rev. Charles Phillips who joined and assisted us even
as Mr. Doke did. Mr. Phillips had long been congregational minister
in the Transvaal. His good wife too did us much service. A third
clergyman who had given up orders to take up the editorship of the
Bloemfontein daily, <i>The Friend</i>, and who supported the Indian
cause in his paper in the teeth of European opposition was the Rev.
Dewdney Drew, one of the best speakers in South Africa. A similarly
spontaneous helper was Mr. Vere Stent, editor of <i>The Pretoria
News</i>. A mass meeting of Europeans was once held in the Town Hall
of Pretoria under the presidentship of the Mayor to condemn the
Indian movement and to support the Black Act. Mr. Vere Stent alone
stood up in opposition to the overwhelming majority of anti-Indians
and</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%; page-break-before: always">
refused to sit down in spite of the president’s orders. The
Europeans threatened to lay hands on him, yet he stood unmoved and
defiant like a lion, and the meeting dispersed at last without
passing its resolution.</p>

There were other Europeans whose names I could mention and who never
missed an opportunity of doing us a good turn, although they did not
formally join any association. But I propose to close this chapter
with a few words about three ladies. One of these was Miss Hobhouse,
the daughter of Lord Hobhouse, who at the time of the Boer War
reached the Transvaal against the wishes of Lord Milner, and who
single-handed moved among the Boer women, encouraged them and bade
them stand firm when Lord Kitchner had set up his famous or rather
infamous ‘concentration camps’ in the Transvaal and the Free
State. She believed the English policy in respect of the Boer War to
be totally unrighteous, and therefore like the late Mr. Stead she
wished and prayed to God for England’s defeat in the war. Having
thus served the Boers, she was shocked to learn that the same Boers,
who had only recently resisted injustice with all their might, were
now led into doing injustice to the Indians through ignorant
prejudice. The Boers looked up to her with great  respect  and
affection. She was very intimate with General Botha, and did her best
to commend to the Boers the policy of repealing the Black Act.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.01cm; line-height: 102%">
The second lady was Miss Olive Schreiner, to whom I have already
referred in a previous chapter. The name Schreiner is one to conjure
with in South Africa, so much so that when Miss Schreiner married,
her husband adopted her name so that (I was  told) her relation with
the Schreiners might not be forgotten among the Europeans of South
Africa. This was not due to any false pride, as Miss Schreiner was as
simple in habits and humble in spirit as she was learned. I had the

The reader may ask what fruit all this sympathy  of  the Europeans
bore. Well, this chapter has not been written to describe the
practical consequences of their sympathy. The work detailed above of
some of these friends bears witness to a portion of the result. The
very nature of satyagraha is such that fruit of the movement is
contained in the movement itself. Satyagraha is based on self-help,
self-sacrifice and faith in God. One of my objects in enumerating the
names of European helpers is to mark the satyagrahis’ gratefulness
to them. This history would be justly considered incomplete without
such mention. I have not tried to make the list exhaustive, but  have
 tendered the Indians’ thanks to all in selecting a few for
especial mention. Secondly, as a satyagrahi I hold to the faith that
all activity pursued with a pure heart is bound to bear fruit,
whether or not such fruit is visible to us. And last but not the
least, I have tried to show that all truthful movements spontaneously
attract to themselves all manner of pure and disinterested help. If
it is not clear already, I should like to make it clear that no other
effort whatever was made during the struggle to enlist European
sympathy beyond the effort, if effort it can be called, involved in
adherence to Truth and Truth alone. The European friends were
attracted by the inherent power of the movement itself.</p>

Phoenix and were naturally anxious about me. But it was not possible

with my work. From the letters of Natal friends I was</p>

aware that in Natal too the settlement had been grossly
misunderstood. And I had received a sheaf of correspondence addressed
to <i>Indian Opinion </i>in which adverse criticism was passed on the
settlement. Although the satyagraha struggle was still confined to
the Transvaal Indians, we had to seek the support and enlist the
sympathies of the Natal Indians also. The Transvaal struggle was not
a mere local affair and the Indians in the Transvaal were really
fighting the battle on behalf of all the Indians in South Africa. And
therefore also I had to go to Durban and remove the misunderstandings
prevalent there. So I took the first opportunity to run up to Durban.</p>

A public meeting of the Indians was called in Durban. Some friends
had warned me beforehand that I would be attacked at this meeting and
that I should therefore not attend it at all or at least take steps
for defending myself. But neither of the two courses was open to me.
If a servant when called by his master fails to respond through fear,
he forfeits his title to the name of servant. Nor does he deserve the
name if he is afraid of the master’s punishment. Service of the
public for service’s sake is like walking on the sword’s edge. If
a servant is ready enough for praise he may nots flee in the face of
blame. I therefore presented myself at the meeting at the appointed
time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1      </font></sup>I

I left Durban for Phoenix the same day. The friends who had guarded
me the previous night would not let me alone, and informed me that
they intended to accompany me to Phoenix. I said, “I cannot prevent
you if you will come in spite of me. But Phoenix is a jungle. And
what will you do if we the only dwellers in it do not give you even
food?” One of the friends replied, “That won’t frighten us. We
are well able to look after ourselves. And so long as we are
a-soldiering, who is there to prevent us from robbing your pantry?”
We thus made a merry party for Phoenix.</p>

remember occasions in my life when I have not rejoiced at  the
thought of approaching death as one might rejoice at the prospect of
meeting a long-lost friend. Thus man often remains weak not-
withstanding all his efforts to be strong, and knowledge which stops
at the head and does not penetrate into the heart is of but little
use in the critical times of living experience. Then again the
strength of the spirit within mostly evaporates when a person gets
and accepts support from outside. A satyagrahi must be always on his
guard against such temptations.</p>

While in Phoenix I did just one thing. I wrote a great deal with a
view to removing misunderstandings about the compromise, including an
imaginary dialogue<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>for  <i>India</i><i>n</i><i> </i><i>Opinio</i><i>n </i><i>
</i>in which I disposed of in ample detail the objections advanced
and criticisms passed against the settlement. I believe that this
dialogue produced a good effect. It was found that the Transvaal
Indians, whose misunderstanding of the settlement, if persistent,
would have led to really disastrous results, did not long
misunderstand it. It was only for the Transvaal Indians to accept or
to reject the settlement. They were on their trial as I was on mine
as their leader and servant. In the end there were hardly any Indians
who had not registered themselves voluntarily. There was such a rush
of the applicants for registration that the officers concerned were
hard pressed with work, and in a very short time the Indians had
fulfilled their part of the settlement. Even the Government had to
admit this,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>and
I could see that the misunderstanding, though of an acute nature, was
quite limited in its extent. There was no doubt a great deal of stir
when some Pathans violently took the law into their own hands. But
such violent stir, when analysed, often turns out to have no bottom
at all and is equally often only temporary. And yet it is a power in
the world today as we are apt to be unnerved in the face of violence.
If, however, we calmly think about it we shall find that there is no
reason for nervousness. Just suppose that Mir Alam and his friends,
instead of only wounding, had actually destroyed my body.</p>

And suppose also that the community had deliberately remained calm
and unperturbed, and forgiven the offenders perceiving  that 
according to their lights they could not have behaved otherwise than
they did. Far from injuring the community, such a noble attitude
would have greatly benefited them. All misunderstanding would have
disappeared, and Mir Alam and party would have had their eyes opened
to the error of their ways. As for me, nothing better can happen to a
satyagrahi than his meeting death all unsought in the very act of
satyagraha, i.e., pursuing Truth. All these propositions are true
only of a struggle like the satyagraha movement, where there is no
room for hatred, where self-reliance is the order of the day, where
no one has to look expectantly at another, where there are no leaders
and hence no followers, or where all are leaders and all are
followers, so that the death of a fighter, however eminent, makes not
for slackness but on the other hand intensifies the struggle.</p>

Such is the pure and essential nature of satyagraha, not realized in
practice, because not every one of us has shed hatred. In actual
practice the secret of satyagraha is not understood by all, and the
many are apt unintelligently to follow the few. Again as Tolstoy
observed, the Transvaal struggle was the first attempt at applying
the principle of satyagraha to masses or bodies of men. I do not know
any historical example of pure mass satyagraha. I cannot however
formulate any definite opinion on the point, as my knowledge of
history is limited. But as a matter of fact we have nothing to do
with historical precedents. Granted the fundamental principles of
satyagraha, it will be seen that the consequences I have described
are bound to follow as the night the day. It will not do to dismiss
such a valuable force with the remark that it is difficult or
impossible of application. Brute force has been the ruling factor in
the world for thousands of years, and mankind has been reaping its
bitter harvest all along, as he who runs may read. There is little
hope of anything good coming out of it in the future. If light can
come out of darkness, then alone can love emerge from hatred.</p>

I am ashamed of writing the caption of this chapter as well as the
chapter itself, for it deals with the obliquity of human nature.
Already in 1908 General Smuts ranked as the ablest leader in South
Africa, and today he takes a high place among the politicians of the
British Empire, and even of the world. I have no doubt about his
great abilities. General Smuts is as able a general and administrator
as he is  a lawyer. Many other politicians have come and gone in
South Africa, but from 1907 up to date the reins of Government have
practically been held throughout by this gentleman, and even today he
holds a unique position in the country. It is now nine years since I
left South Africa. I do not know what epithet the people of South
Africa now bestow upon General Smuts. His Christian name is Jan, and
South Africa used to call him ‘slim Janny’.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Many English friends had  asked me to beware of General
Smuts,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>as he
was a very clever man and a trimmer, whose words were intelligible
only to himself and often of a kind that either party could interpret
them in a sense favourable to himself. Indeed on a suitable occasion
he would lay aside the interpretations of both the parties, put a
fresh interpretation upon them, carry it out and support it by such
clever arguments that the parties for the time being would be led to
imagine that they were wrong themselves and General Smuts was right
in constructing the words as he did! As regards the events I am now
going to describe, we believed and said, when they happened, that
General Smuts  had  played us false. Even today I look upon the
incident as a breach of faith from the Indian community’s
standpoint. However I have placed a mark of interrogation after the
phrase, as in point of fact the General’s action did not perhaps
amount to an intentional breach of faith. It could not be described
as breach of faith if the intention was absent. My experience of
General Smuts in 1913-14 did not then seem bitter and does not seem
so to me today, when I can think of the past events with a greater
sense of detachment. It is quite possible that in behaving towards
the Indians as he did in 1908 General Smuts was not guilty of a
deliberate breach of faith.</p>

We have seen in the last chapter how the Indians registered
voluntarily to the satisfaction of the Transvaal Government. The
Government must now repeal the Black Act, and if they did, the
satyagraha struggle would come to an end. This did not mean the end
of the entire mass of anti-Indian legislation in the country or the
redress of all the Indian grievances, for which the Indians must
still continue their constitutional agitation. Satyagraha was
directed solely to the scattering of the new and ominous cloud on the
horizon in the shape of the Black Act which, if accepted by the
Indians, would have humiliated them and prepared the way for their
final extinction first in the Transvaal and then throughout South
Africa. But instead of repealing the Black Act, General Smuts took a
fresh step forward. He maintained the Black Act in the statute-book
and introduced into the legislature a measure<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>validating the voluntary registrations effected and the
certificates issued subsequent to the date fixed by the Government in
terms of that Act, taking the holders of the voluntary registration
certificates out of its operation, and making further provision for
the registration of Asiatics. Thus there came into force two
concurrent pieces of legislation with one and the same object, and
freshly arriving Indians as well as even later applicants for
registration were still subject to the Black Act.</p>

I was astounded when I read the Bill. I did not know how I would face
the community. Here was excellent food for the Pathan friend who had
severely criticized me at the midnight meeting. But I must say that
far from shaking it, this blow made my faith in satyagraha stronger
than ever. I called a meeting of our Committee and explained the new
situation to them. Some of the members tauntingly said, “There you
are. We have often been telling you that you are very credulous, and
believe in everything that anyone says. It would not matter much if
you were so simple in your private affairs, but the community has to
suffer for your credulity in public matters. It is very difficult now
to rouse the same spirit as actuated our people before. You know what
stuff we Indians are made of, men whose momentary enthusiasm must be
taken at the flood. If you neglect the</p>

There was no bitterness in these taunting words. Such things had been
addressed to me on other occasions. I replied with a  smile: “Well,
what you call my credulity is part and parcel of myself. It is not
credulity but trust, and it is the duty of everyone of us, yours as
well as mine, to trust our fellow men. And even granting that it is
really a defect with me, you must take me as you find me with my
defects no less than with my qualities. But I cannot concede that the
enthusiasm of the community is a mere temporary effervescence. You
must remember that you, as well as I, are members of the community. 
I should consider it an insult if you thus characterized my
enthusiasm.  I take it that you too regard yourselves as exceptions
to the general rule you seek to formulate. But if you don’t, you do
the community the injustice of imagining that others are as
weak-kneed as yourselves. In great struggles like ours there is
always an ebb and a flow. However clear may be your understanding
with the adversary, what is there to prevent him from breaking faith?
There are many among us who pass promissory notes to others. What can
be clearer and more free from doubt than a man’s putting his
signature to a document? Yet suits must be filed against them; they
will oppose the suits and offer all kinds of defence. At last there
are decrees and writs of attachment which take a long time and cost
great trouble to execute. Who can guarantee against the repetition of
such flagrant behaviour? I would therefore advise you patiently to
deal with the problem before us. We have to consider what we can do
in case the struggle  has  to  be resumed, that is to say, what each
satyagrahi can do absolutely regardless of the conduct of others.
Personally I am inclined to think that if only we are true to
ourselves, others will not be found wanting, and even if they are
inclined to weakness, they will be strengthened by our example.”</p>

I believe this was enough to conciliate the well-intentioned sceptics
who were doubtful about the resumption of the struggle. About this
time Mr. Kachhalia began to show his mettle and come to the front. On
every point he would announce his considered opinion in the fewest
words possible and then stick to it through thick and thin. I do not
remember a single occasion on which he betrayed weakness or doubt
about the final result. A time came when Yusuf Mian was not ready to
continue at the helm in troubled waters. We all with one voice
acclaimed Kachhalia as our captain and from that time</p>

forward to the end he held unflinchingly to his responsible post. He
fearlessly put up with hardships which would have daunted almost any
other man in his place. As the struggle advanced, there came a
stagewhen going to jail was a perfectly easy task for some and a
means of getting well-earned rest, whereas it was infinitely more
difficult to remain outside, minutely to look into all things, to
make various arrangements and to deal with all sorts and conditions
of men.</p>

Later on the European creditors of Kachhalia caught him as in a
noose. Many Indian traders are entirely dependent in their trade on
European firms, which sell them lakhs of rupees worth of goods on
credit on mere personal security. That Europeans should repose such
trust in Indian traders is an excellent proof of the general honesty
of Indian trade. Kachhalia likewise owed large sums to many European
firms, which asked him at once to meet their dues, being instigated
thereto directly or indirectly by the Government. The firms gave
Kachhalia to understand that they would not press for immediate
payment if he left the satyagraha movement. But if he did not, they
were afraid of losing their money as he might be arrested any time by
the Government, and therefore demanded immediate satisfaction in
cash. Kachhalia bravely replied that his participation in the Indian
struggle was his personal affair which had nothing to do with his
trade. He considered that his religion, the honour of his community
and his own self-respect were bound up with the struggle. He thanked
his creditors for the support they had extended to him, but refused
to attach any undue importance to that support or indeed to his
trade. Their money was perfectly safe with him, and as long as he was
alive he would repay them in full at any cost. But if anything
happened to him, his stock as well as the book debts owing to him
were at their disposal. He therefore wished that his creditors would
continue to trust him, as before. This was a perfectly fair argument,
and Kachhalia’s firmness was an additional reason for his creditors
to trust him but on this occasion it failed to impress them. We can
rouse from his  slumbers a man who is really asleep, but not him who
only makes a pretence of sleep all the while that he is awake, and so
it was with these European traders, whose sole object was to bring
undue pressure to bear upon Kachhalia. Otherwise their money was
perfectly safe. A meeting of the creditors was held in my office
onJanuary 22, 1909.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>I

Kachhalia was purely political and unworthy of merchants, and they
were incensed at my remark. I showed them Kachhalia Sheth’s
balance-sheet and proved that they could have their 20s. in the
pound. Again if the creditors wanted to sell the business to someone
else, Kachhalia was ready to hand over the goods and the book debts
to the purchaser. If this did not suit them, the creditors could take
over the stock in Kachhalia’s shop at cost price, and if any part
of their dues still remained unsatisfied, they were free to take over
book debts due to him sufficient to cover the deficit. The reader can
see that in agreeing to this arrangement the European merchants had
nothing to lose. I had on many previous occasions effected such
arrangements with the creditors of some of my clients who were hard
pressed. But the merchants at this juncture did not seek justice.
They were out to bend Kachhalia. Kachhalia would not bend, bankruptcy
proceedings were instituted against him, and he was declared an
insolvent, though his estate showed a large excess of assets over
liabilities.</p>

Far from being a blot upon his escutcheon this insolvency was
perfectly honourable to him. It enhanced his prestige among the
community and all congratulated him upon his firmness and courage.
But such heroism is rarely found. The man in the street cannot
understand how insolvency can cease to be insolvency, cease to be a
disgrace and become an honour and an ornament, but Kachhalia realized
it at once. Many traders had submitted to the Black Act merely from a
fear of insolvency. Kachhalia could have warded off the insolvency if
he had wished, not by leaving the struggle,—that was out of the
question,—but by borrowing from his many Indian friends who would
have gladly helped him over the crisis. But it would not have been
becoming in him to have saved his trade by such means. The danger of
being any day clapped into jail he shared in common with all
satyagrahis. It would therefore be hardly proper for him to borrow
from a fellow-satyagrahi to pay his European creditors. But among his
friends there were ‘blacklegs’ also whose help was available.
Indeed one or two of them actually offered assistance. But to accept
their offer would have been tantamount to an admission that there was
wisdom in submitting to the obnoxious Act. We therefore decided to
decline their proffered aid.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Again we thought that if Kachhalia allowed himself to be declared an
insolvent, his insolvency would serve as a shield for others, for if
not in all, at least in an overwhelmingly large majority of cases</p>

of insolvency, the creditor stands to lose something. He is quite
pleased if he realizes 10s. in the pound, and considers 15s. quite as
good  as   20s.   in   the   pound.  For   big   traders    in   
South Africa generally reap a profit not of 6_ but of 25 per
cent.They therefore consider 15s. as good as full payment. But as
20s. in the pound is hardly ever realized from a bankrupt’s estate,
creditors are not anxious to reduce their debtor to a state of
insolvency. As soon, therefore, as Kachhalia was declared an
insolvent, there was every likelihood that the European traders would
cease to threaten other satyagrahi traders who were their debtors.
And that was exactly what happened. The Europeans wanted to compel
Kachhalia either to give up the struggle or else to pay them in full
in cash. They failed to achieve either of these two objects, and the
actual result was the very reverse of what they had expected. They
were dumbfounded by this first case of a respectable Indian trader
welcoming insolvency and were quiet ever afterwards. In a year’s
time the creditors realized 20s. in the pound from Kachhalia Sheth’s
stock-in-trade, and this was the first case in South Africa to my
knowledge in which creditors were paid in full from the insolvent
debtor’s estate. Thus even while the struggle was in progress,
Kachhalia commanded great respect among the European merchants, who
showed their readiness to advance to him any amount of goods in spite
of his leading the movement.. But Kachhalia was every day gaining in
strength and in an intelligent appreciation of the struggle. No one
could now tell how long the struggle would last. We had therefore
resolved after the insolvency proceedings that the Sheth should not
make any large commitments in trade during the continuance of the
movement, but confine his operations within such moderate limits as
would suffice to provide him with his daily bread. He therefore did
not avail himself of the European merchants’ offer.</p>

I need scarcely say that all these incidents in the life  of 
Kachhalia Sheth did not happen soon after the Committee meeting
referred to above, but I have found place for them here in the shape
of a connected narrative. Chronologically, Kachhalia  became Chairman
some time after the resumption of the struggle (September 10, 1908)

Smuts was a past master of this art. You may write to him as often as

is unwilling to reply, nothing that you do can draw him out. The law
of courtesy, which requires a gentleman to reply to letters received,

I met Albert Cartwright who had been our mediator. He was deeply
shocked and exclaimed, “Really I cannot understand this man at all.
I perfectly remember that he promised to repeal the Asiatic Act. I
will do my best, but you know that nothing can move General Smuts
when he has once taken up a stand. Newspaper articles are as nothing

met Mr. Hosken who wrote to General Smuts but who received only a
very unsatisfactory reply. I wrote articles in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion

which of these two appellations would fit General Smuts. I must admit
that there is a sort of philosophy about his  attitude. When I was
corresponding with him and writing in the paper-against him, I
remember I had taken General Smuts to be a heartless man. But this
was only the beginning of the struggle, only its second year, while

If on the one hand we were trying to induce General Smuts to fulfil
his part of the settlement, we were on the other hand
enthusiastically engaged in ‘educating’ the community. We found
the people everywhere ready to resume the struggle and go to  jail.
Meetings were held in every place, where we explained the
correspondence which was being carried on with the Government. The
weekly diary<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>in
<i>Indian Opinion </i>kept the Indians fully abreast of current
events, and they were warned of the impending failure of the
voluntary registration, and asked to hold themselves in readiness to
burn the certificates if the Black Act was not repealed after all,
and thus let the Government note that the community was fearless and
firm and ready to go to prison. Certificates were collected from
every place with a view to making a bonfire of them.</p>

Government by the satyagrahis. The word was not the satyagrahis’

The so-called ultimatum may be thus summarized: ‘The point of the
agreement between the Indians and General Smuts clearly was that if
the Indians registered voluntarily, he on his part should bring
forward in the Legislature a bill to validate such registration and
to repeal the Asiatic Act. It is well known that the Indians have
registered voluntarily to the satisfaction of the Government, and
therefore the Asiatic Act must be repealed. The community has sent
many communications to General Smuts and taken allpossible legal
steps to obtain redress but thus far to no purpose. At a time when
the bill is passing through the Legislature, it is up to the leaders
to apprise the Government of the discontent and strong feeling
prevalent in the community. We regret to state that, if the Asiatic
Act is not repealed in terms of the settlement and if Government’s
decision to that effect is not communicated to the Indians before a
specific date, the certificates collected by the Indians would be
burnt, and they would humbly but firmly take the consequences.’</p>

One reason why this letter was held to be an ultimatum was that it
prescribed a time-limit for reply. Another reason was that the
Europeans looked upon the Indians as savages. If the Europeans had
considered the Indians to be their equals, they would have found this
letter perfectly courteous and would have given it most serious
consideration. But the fact that the Europeans thought Indians to be
barbarians was a sufficient reason for the Indians to write such a
letter. The Indians must either confess to their being barbarians and
consent to be suppressed as such, or else they must take active steps
in repudiation of the charge of barbarism. This letter was the first
of such steps. If there had not been behind the letter an iron
determination to act up to it; it would have been held an
impertinence, and the Indians would have proved themselves to be a
thoughtless and foolish race.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
The reader will perhaps point out that the charge of barbarism was
repudiated in 1906 when the satyagraha pledge was taken. And, if so,
there was nothing new about this letter which might warrant my giving
it so much importance and dating the denial of the charge from it.
This is true so far as it goes; but on thinking a little more deeply,
it will appear that the repudiation really began with this letter. It
should be remembered that the satyagraha pledge came in almost by
accident, and the subsequent imprisonments followed as an inevitable
corollary. The community then gained largely in stature,</p>

but unconsciously. But when this letter was written, there was a
deliberate intention of claiming full knowledge and high prestige.
Now as well as before the object aimed at was the repeal of the Black
Act. But there was change in the style of language used,  in  the
methods of work selected and in other things besides. When a slave
salutes a master and a friend salutes a friend, the form is the same
in either case, but there is a world of difference between the two,
which enables the detached observer to recognize the slave and the
friend at once.</p>

There was much discussion among ourselves when  the ultimatum was
forwarded. Would not the demand for reply within a stated period be
considered impudent? Might it not be that it would stiffen the
Government and lead them to reject our terms which otherwise they
might have accepted? Would it not be sufficient indirectly to
announce the community’s decision to the Government? After giving
due weight to all these considerations we unanimously came to the
conclusion that we must do what we thought to be right and proper for
us to do. We must run the risk of being charged with discourtesy, as
well as the risk of Government refusing in a huff what otherwise they
might have granted. If we do not admit our inferiority as human
beings in any sense whatever and if we believe that we possess the
capacity for unlimited suffering for any length of time, we must
adopt a straightforward course without hesitation.</p>

The reader will perhaps see that there was some novelty and
distinction about the step now taken, which had its reverberations in
the Legislature and in European circles outside. Some congratulated
the Indians on their courage while others got very angry, and asked
for condign punishment to be awarded to the Indians for their
insolence. Either section acknowledged the novelty of the Indians’
fresh move by its conduct. This letter created greater stir than even
the commencement of the satyagraha movement, which too was a novelty
when it was started. The reason is obvious. When satyagraha was
started, no one knew what the Indians were capable of, and therefore
neither such a letter nor the language in which it was couched would
have been fitting for that initial stage. But now the community had
had its baptism of fire. Everyone had seen that the Indians had the
capacity of suffering the hardships incidental to an attempt to get
their wrongs righted, and therefore the language of the ‘ultimatum’
appeared in the light of a natural growth and not at all
inappropriate</p>

	The ultimatum was to expire on the same day that the new Asiatic
	Bill was to be carried  through  the  Legislature.  A  meeting had
	been called some two hours after the expiry of the time-limit to
	perform the public ceremony of burning the certificates. The

	As the business of the meeting was about to commence, a volunteer
	arrived on a cycle with a telegram from the Government in which they
	regretted the determination of the Indian community and announced
	their inability to change their line of action. The telegram was

	were glad that the auspicious opportunity of burning the

	have if the Government had complied with the demands formulated in

resolutions were adopted. I clearly detailed the various stages of
the protracted negotiations and said, “If there is any Indian who
has handed in his certificate to be burnt but wants it to be returned
to him, let him step forward and have it. Merely burning the
certificates is no crime, and will not enable those who court
imprisonment to win it. By burning the certificates we only declare
our solemn resolution never to submit to the Black Act and divest
ourselves of the power of even showing the certificates. But it is
open to anyone to take out a copy tomorrow of the certificate that
may be burnt to ashes today, and if there are any persons here who
contemplate such a cowardly act ordoubt their own ability to stand
the ordeal, there is still time for them to have their certificates
back, and these can be given back to them. No one need be ashamed of
getting his certificate back just now, as in doing so he will be
exhibiting a certain kind of courage. But it would be not only
shameful but also detrimental to the best interests of the community
to get a copy of the certificate afterwards. Again let us take note
that this is going to be a protracted struggle. We know that some of
us have fallen out of the marching army, and the burden of those who
remain has been made heavier to that extent. I would advise you to
ponder over all these considerations and only then to take the plunge
proposed today.”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

Even during my speech there were voices saying, “We do not want the
certificates back, burn them.” Finally I suggested that if anyone
wanted to oppose the resolution, he should come forward, but no one
stood up. Mir Alam too was present at this meeting. He announced that
he had done wrong in assaulting me as he did and, to the great joy of
the audience, handed his original certificate to be burnt, as he had
not taken out a voluntary certificate. I took hold of his hand,
pressed it with joy, and assured him once more that I had never

echoes of their continuous cheers during the burning process. Some of
those who had still withheld their certificates brought them in
numbers to the platform, and these too were consigned to the flames.
When asked why he handed his certificate only at the last moment, one
of these friends said that he did so as it was more appropriate and
would create a greater impression on the onlookers. Another frankly
admitted his want of courage and a feeling that the certificates
might not be burnt after all. But he could not possibly withhold  the
 certificate after he had seen the bonfire and gave it up, from an
idea that the fate of all might well be his own fate too. Such
frankness was  a matter of frequent experience during the struggle.</p>

The reporters of English newspapers present at the meeting were
profoundly impressed with the whole scene and gave graphic
descriptions of the meeting in their papers. A description of the
meeting was sent to <i>The </i><i>Daily Mail </i>(London) by its
Johannesburg correspondent, in course of which he compared the act of
the Indians in burning their certificates with that of the Boston Tea
Party. I do not think this comparison did more than justice to the
Indians, seeing that if the whole might of the British Empire was
ranged against the hundreds of thousands of able Europeans in
America, herein South Africa a helpless body of 13,000 Indians had
challenged the powerful Government of the Transvaal. The Indians’
only weapon was faith in the righteousness of their own cause and in
God. There is no doubt that this weapon is all-sufficient and
all-powerful for the devout, but so long as that is not the view of
the man in the street, 13,000 unarmed Indians might appear
insignificant before the well-armed Europeans of America. As God is
the strength of the weak, it is as well that the world despises them.</p>

During the same year in which the Black Act was passed General Smuts
carried through the Legislature another bill called the Transvaal
Immigrants Restriction Bill (Act 15 of 1907)<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
which was ostensibly of general application but was chiefly aimed at
the Indians. This Act generally followed the lines of similar

It was absolutely essential for the Indians to resist this fresh
inroad  on  their  rights,  but  the   question   was  whether   it  
should be made a plank in the satyagraha struggle. The community was
not bound as to when and regarding what subjects they should offer
satyagraha, in deciding which question they must only not transgress
the limits prescribed by wisdom and appreciation of their  own
capacity. Satyagraha offered on every occasion seasonable or 
otherwise would  be  corrupted  into <i>duragraha</i>.  And  if 
anyone takes to satyagraha without having measured his own strength
and afterwards sustains a defeat, he not only disgraces himself but
also brings the matchless weapon of satyagraha into disrepute by his
folly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The Satyagraha Committee saw that the Indians’ satyagraha was being
offered only against the Black Act, and that if the Black Act was
once repealed, the Immigration Restriction Act would lose the sting
to which I have referred. Still if the Indians did not take any steps
regarding the Immigration Act from an idea that a separate movement
against it was unnecessary, their silence might be misconstrued as
implying their consent to the total prohibition of Indian immigration
in the future. The Immigration Act too must therefore be opposed, and
the only question was: Should this also be included in the satyagraha
struggle? The community’s view was that it was their duty to
include in the satyagraha any fresh attacks on their rights made
while the struggle was in progress. If they did not feel strong
enough to do so, that was altogether a different matter. The leaders
came to the conclusion that their lack or deficiency of strength
should not be made a pretext for letting the Immigration Act alone,
and  that  therefore this Act too must be covered by the satyagraha
struggle.</p>

Correspondence was therefore carried on with the Government<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

Smuts to agree to a change in the law, but it provided him with a
fresh handle for vilifying the community and, really speaking,
myself. General Smuts knew that many more Europeans, besides those
who were publicly helping us, were privately sympathetic to our
movement, and he naturally wished that their sympathy should be
alienated if possible.</p>

He therefore charged me with raising a fresh point, and he told as
well as wrote to our supporters that they did not know me as he did.
If he yielded an inch, I would ask for an ell and therefore it was
that he was not repealing the Asiatic Act. When satyagraha was
started, there was no question whatever about fresh immigrants. Now
when he was legislating to prevent the fresh entry of any more
Indians in the interest of the Transvaal, there too I had threatened
satyagraha. He could not any more put up with this ‘cunning’. I
might do my worst, and every Indian might be ruined, but he would not
repeal the Asiatic Act, nor would the Transvaal Government give up
the policy they had adopted regarding the Indians, and in this just
attitude they were entitled to the support of all Europeans.</p>

A little reflection will show how totally unjust and immoral this
argument was. When there was nothing like the Immigrants Restriction
Act at all in existence, how were the Indians or myself to oppose it?
General Smuts talked glibly about his experience of what he called my
‘cunning’ and yet he could not cite a single case in point in
support of his statement. And I do not remember to have ever resorted
to cunning during all those years that I lived in South Africa. I may
now go even farther and say without the least hesitation that I have
never had recourse to cunning in all my life. I believe that cunning
is not only morally wrong but also politically inexpedient, and have
therefore always discountenanced its use even from the practical
standpoint. It is hardly necessary for me to defend myself. I would
even be ashamed of defending myself before the class of readers for
whom this is written. If even now they have not seen that I am free
from cunning, nothing that I could write in self-defence could
convince them of that fact. I have penned these few sentences only
with a view to giving the reader an idea of the difficulties which
were encountered during the satyagraha struggle and of the imminent
danger to the movement if the Indians even by a hair’s breadth
swerved from the strait and narrow path. The rope-dancer, balancing
himself upon a rope suspended at a height of twenty feet, must
concentrate his attention upon the rope, and the least little error
in so doing means death for him, no matter on which side he falls. My
eight years’ experience of satyagraha in South Africa has taught me
that a satyagrahi has to be if possible even more single-minded than
the rope-dancer. The friends before whom General Smuts levelled this
charge at me knew me well, and therefore the charge had an effect
over them just the opposite of what General Smuts had desired. They</p>

not only did not give me up or the movement but grew even more
zealous in supporting us, and the Indians saw later on that they
would have been in for no end of trouble if their satyagraha had not
been extended to the Immigration Act also.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
My experience has taught  me  that  a  law  of progression applies to
every righteous struggle. But in the case of satyagraha the law
amounts to an axiom. As the  Ganga  advances,  other  streams  flow
into it, and hence at the mouth it grows so wide that neither bank is
to be seen and a person sailingupon the river cannot make out where
the river ends and the sea begins. So also as a satyagraha struggle
progresses onward, many another element helps toswell its current,
and there is a constant growth in the results to which it leads. This
is really inevitable, and is bound up with the first principles of
satyagraha. For in satyagraha the minimum is also the maximum, and as
it is the irreducible minimum, there is no question of retreat, and
the only movement possible is an advance. In other struggles, even
when they are righteous, the demand is first pitched a little higher
so as to admit of future reduction, and hence the law of progression
does not apply to all of them without exception. But I must explain
how the law of progression comes into play when the minimum is also
the maximum as in satyagraha. The Ganga does not leave its course in
search of tributaries. Even so does the satyagrahi not leave his path
which is sharp as the sword’s edge. But as  the  tributaries
spontaneously join the Ganga as it advances, so it is with the river
that is satyagraha. Seeing that the Immigration Act was included in
the satyagraha, some Indians ignorant of the principles of satyagraha
insisted upon the whole mass of the anti-Indian legislation in the
Transvaal being similarly treated. Others again suggested a
mobilization of Indians all over South Africa and the offering of
satyagraha against all anti-Indian legislation in Natal, the Cape
Colony, the Orange Free State, etc., while the Transvaal struggle was
on. Both the suggestions involved a breach of principle. I distinctly
said that it would be dishonest now, having seen the opportunity, to
take up a position which was not in view when satyagraha was started.
No matter how strong we were, the present struggle must close when
the demands for which it was commenced were accepted. I am confident
that if we had not adhered to this principle, instead of winning, we
would not only have lost all along the line, but also forfeited the
sympathy which had been enlisted in our favour. On the other hand if
the adversary himself creates new difficulties for us</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
while the struggle is in progress, they become automatically included
in it. A satyagrahi, without being false to his faith, cannot
disregard new difficulties which confront him while he is pursuing
his own course. The adversary is not a satyagrahi,—satyagraha
against satyagraha is impossible,—and is not bound by any limit of
maximum or minimum. He can therefore try if he wishes to frighten the
satyagrahi by raising novel issues. But the satyagrahi has renounced
all fear, tackles by satyagraha the later difficulties as well as the
former and trusts that it will help him to hold his own against all
odds. Therefore as a satyagraha struggle is prolonged, that is to say
by the adversary, it is the adversary who stands to lose from his own
standpoint, and it is the satyagrahi who stands to gain. We shall
come across other illustrations of the working of this law in the
later stages of this struggle.</p>

Now as satyagraha was made to embrace the Immigration Act as well,
satyagrahis had to test the right of educated Indians to enter the
Transvaal. The Committee decided that the test should not be made
through any ordinary Indian. The idea was that some Indian, who did
not come within the four corners of the definition of a prohibited
immigrant in the new Act in so far as the definition was acceptable
to the community, should enter the Transvaal and go to jail. We had
thus to show that satyagraha is a force containing within itself
seeds of progressive self-restraint. There was a section in the Act
to the effect that any person who was not conversant with a European
language should be treated as a prohibited immigrant. The Committee
therefore proposed that some Indian who knew English but who had not
been to the Transvaal before should enter the country. Several young
Indians volunteered for the purpose, out of whom Sorabji Shapurji
Adajania was selected.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Sorabji was a Parsi. There were not perhaps more than a  hundred
Parsis in the whole of South Africa. I held in South Africa the same
views about the Parsis as I have expressed in India. There are not
more than a hundred thousand Parsis in the world, and this alone
speaks volumes for their high character that such a small community
has long preserved its prestige, clung to its religion and proved
itself second to none  in  the  world  in  point  of  charity. But 
Sorabji turned out to be pure gold. I was but slightly acquainted
with him</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
when he joined the struggle. His letters as regards participation in
satyagraha left a good impression on me. As I am a lover of the great
qualities of the Parsis, I was not and I am not unaware of some of
their defects as a community. I was therefore doubtful whether
Sorabji would be able to stand to his guns in critical times. But it
was a rule with  me  not to  attach   any   weight   to   my   own  
doubts   where the party concerned himself asserted the contrary. I
therefore recommended to the Committee that they should take Sorabji
at his word, and eventually Sorabji proved himself to be a

not only was one of the satyagrahis who suffered the longest terms of
imprisonment, but also made such deep study of the struggle that his
views commanded respectful hearing from all. His advice always showed
firmness, wisdom, charity and deliberation.He was slow to form an
opinion as well as to change an opinion once formed. He was as much
of an Indian as of a Parsi, and was quite free from the bane of
narrow communalism. After the struggle was over Dr. Mehta<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>offered a scholarship in order to enable some good
satyagrahi to proceed to England to study for the bar. I was
charged-with the selection. There were two or three deserving
candidates, but all the friends felt that there was none who could
approach Sorabji in maturity of judgment and ripeness of wisdom, and
he was selected accordingly. The idea was that on his return to South
Africa he should take my place and serve the community. Sorabji went
to England with the blessings of the community and was duly called to
the bar. He had already come in contact with Gokhale in South Africa,
and his relations with him became closer in England. Sorabji
captivated Gokhale who asked him to join the Servants of India
Society when he returned to India. Sorabji became extremely
popular-among the students. He would share the sorrows of all, and
his soul was not tarnished by the luxury and the artificiality in 
England. When he went to England, he was above thirty, and he had
only a working knowledge of English. But difficulties vanish at the
touch of man’s perseverance. Sorabji lived the pure life of a
student and passed his examinations. The bar examinations in my time
were easy. Barristers nowadays have to study very much harder. But
Sorabji knew not what it was to be defeated. When the ambulance corps
was organized in England, he was one of the pioneers as also one of
those</p>

satyagraha,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>in

After being called to the bar in England Sorabji returned to
Johannesburg where he began to practise law as well as to serve the
community. Every letter I received from South Africa was full of
praise for Sorabji: ‘He is as simple in habits as ever, and free
from the slightest trace of vanity. He mixes with all, rich as well
as poor.’ But God seems to be as cruel as He is merciful. Sorabji
caught a galloping phthisis and died in a few months, leaving the
Indians whose love he had freshly acquired to mourn his loss. Thus
within a very short period God bereft the community of two
outstanding personalities, Kachhalia and Sorabji. If I were asked to
choose between the two, Iwould be at a loss to decide. In fact, each
was supreme in his own field. And Sorabji was as good an Indian as he
was a good Parsi, even as Kachhalia was as good an Indian as he was a
good Mussalman.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus, Sorabji entered the Transvaal, having previously informed the
Government of his intention to test his right to remain in the
country under the Immigrants Restriction Act. The Government were not
at all prepared for this and could not at once decide what to do with
Sorabji, who publicly crossed the border and  entered  the country.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>The Immigration Restriction Officer knew him. Sorabji
told him that he was deliberately entering the Transvaal for a test
case, and asked him to examine him in English or to arrest him just
as he pleased. The officer replied that there was no question of
examining him as he was aware of his knowledge of English. He had no
orders to arrest him. Sorabji might enter the country and the
Government, if they wished, would arrest him where he went.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus contrary to our expectation Sorabji reached Johannesburg and we
welcomed him in our midst. No one had hoped that the Government would
permit him to proceed even an inch beyond the frontier station of
Volksrust. Very often it so happens that when we take prompt steps
deliberately and fearlessly, the government is not ready to oppose
us. The reason for this lies in the very nature of</p>

Government. A Government officer does not ordinarily make his
department so much his own as to arrange his ideas on every subject
beforehand and make preparations accordingly. Again, the officer has
not one but many things to attend to, and his mind is divided between
them. Thirdly, the official suffers from the intoxication of power,
is thus apt to be careless and believes that it is child’s play for
the authorities to deal with any movement whatever. On the other
hand, the public worker knows his ideal as well as the means to
achieve his end, and if he has definite plans, he is perfectly ready
to carry them out, and his work is the only subject of his thoughts
day and night. If, therefore, he takes the right steps with decision,
he is always  in  advance of the government. Many movements fail, not
because governments are endowed with extraordinary power but because
the leaders are lacking in the qualities just referred to.</p>

In short,  whether   through  the   negligence   or   the   set
design of the Government Sorabji reached as far as Johannesburg, and
the local officer had neither any idea of his duty in a case likethis
nor any instructions from his superiors on the point. Sorabji’s
arrival increased our enthusiasm, and some young men thought that the
Government were defeated and would soon come to terms. They saw their
mistake very soon, however. They even realized that a settlement
could perhaps be purchased only by the self-sacrifice of many young
men.</p>

Sorabji informed the Police Superintendent,  Johannesburg, about his
arrival and let him know that he believed himself entitled to remain
in the Transvaal in terms of the new Immigration Act, as he had
ordinary knowledge of English, in respect of which he was ready to
submit to an examination by the officer if he so desired. No reply to
this letter was received, or rather the reply came after some days in
the form of a summons.</p>

Before the case began, we held a meeting of the Indians present on

victory and to brave all dangers and risks. In the meanwhile, I had

The Magistrate took up the case in due course. I defended Sorabji,
and at once asked for his discharge on the ground of the summons
being defective.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>The
Public Prosecutor also made an argument, but on the 9th the Court
upheld my contention and discharged Sorabji who, however, immediately
received warning to appear before the Court the next day, Friday,

On the 10th, the Magistrate ordered Sorabji to leave  the  Transvaal
within seven days.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3 </font></sup>After
the Court’s order was served upon him, Sorabji informed
Superintendent J.A.G. Vernon that it was not his desire to leave. He
was accordingly brought to theCourt once more, on the 20th, charged
with failing to obey the Magistrate’s order, and sentenced to a
month’s imprisonment with hard labour.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">4
</font></sup>The Government, however, did not arrest the localIndians
as they saw that the more arrests there were the higher did the
Indians’ spirit rise. Again, Indians were sometimes discharged
thanks to legal technicalities in the cases instituted against them
and this also served to redouble the ardour of the community.
Government had carried through the Legislature all the laws they
wanted. Many Indians had indeed burnt the certificates but they had
proved their right to remain in the country by their registration.
Government therefore saw no sense in prosecuting them simply to send
them to jail, and thought that the workers would cool down finding no
outlet for their energies in view of the masterly inactivity of the
Government. But they were reckoning without their host. The Indians
took fresh steps to test the Government’s patience, which was soon
exhausted.</p>

There were several Indians in Natal who possessed ancient rights of
domicile in the Transvaal. They had no need to enter the Transvaal
for trade, but the community held that they had the right of entry.
They also had some knowledge of English. Again there was no breach of
the principles of satyagraha in educated Indians like Sorabji
entering the Transvaal. We therefore decided that two classes  of
Indians should enter the Transvaal: first, those who had previously
been domiciled in the country and, secondly, those who had received
English education.</p>

Of these Sheth Daud Mahomed and Parsi Rustomji were big traders, and
Surendra Medh, Pragji Khandubhai Desai, Ratansi Mulji Sodha, Harilal

of his wife being dangerously ill.</p>

Let me introduce Sheth Daud Mahomed to the reader. He was president
of the Natal Indian Congress, and one of the oldestIndian traders
that came to South Africa. He was a Sunni Vora from Surat. I have
seen but few Indians in South Africa who equalled him in tact. He had
excellent powers of understanding. He had not had much literary
education but he spoke English and Dutch well. He was skilful in his
business intercourse with Europeantraders. His liberality-was widely
known. About fifty guests would dine with him everyday. He was one of
the chief contributors to Indian collections. He had the priceless
jewel of a son who far surpassed him in character. The boy’s heart
was pure as crystal. Daud Sheth never came in the way of his son’s
aspirations. Indeed it would be no exaggeration to say that the
father almost worshipped the son. He wished that none of his own
defects should reappear in the boy and had sent him to England for
education. But Daud Sheth lost this treasure, of a son in his prime.
Phthisis claimed Husen for its victim. This was a sore wound that
never healed. With Husen died the high hopes which the Indians had
cherished about him. He was a most truthful lad, and Hindu and
Mussalman were to him as the left and the right eye. Even Daud Sheth
is now no more with us. Who is there upon whom Death does not lay his
hands?</p>

papers, and I hope they will excuse me for it. I am not writing these

path and how they were removed. Even where I have mentioned names I
have done so in order to point out to the reader how men who might be
considered illiterate distinguished themselves in South Africa; how
Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis and Christians there worked harmoniously 
together and how traders, ‘educated’ men and others fulfilled
their duty. Where a man of high merit has been mentioned, praise has

When Daud Sheth thus arrived on the frontiers of the Transvaal with
his satyagrahi ‘army’, the Government was ready to meet him. The
Government would become an object of ridicule if it allowed such a
large troop to enter the Transvaal, and was therefore bound to arrest
them. So they were arrested, and on August 18, 1908, brought before
the Magistrate who ordered them to leave the Transvaal within seven
days. They disobeyed the order of course, were rearrested at Pretoria
on the 28th and deported without trial. They re-entered the Transvaal
on the 31st and finally on September 8 were sentenced at Volksrust to
a fine of fifty pounds or three months’ imprisonment with hard
labour. Needless to say, they cheerfully elected to go to jail.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

The Transvaal Indians were now in high spirits. If they could not
compel the release of their Natal compatriots, they must certainly
share their imprisonment. They therefore cast about for means which
would land them in jail. There were several ways in which they could
have their heart’s desire. If a domiciled Indian did not show his
registration certificate, he would not be given a trading licence and
it would be an offence on his part if he traded without a licence.
Again one must show the certificate if one wanted to enter the
Transvaal from Natal, and would be arrested if one had none to show.
The certificates had already been burnt and the line was therefore
clear. The Indians employed both these methods. Some began to hawk
without a licence while others were arrested for not  showing 
certificates upon entering the Transvaal.</p>

Among those who thus courted arrest was our ‘Imam Saheb’, Imam
Abdul Kadar Bavazir, who was arrested for hawking without a licence
and sentenced on July 21, 1908, to imprisonment for four days with
hard labour. Imam Saheb’s health was so delicate that  people
laughed when they heard of his courting arrest. Some people came to
me and asked me not to take Imam Saheb for fear he might bring
discredit upon the community. I disregarded this warning. It was none
of my business to gauge the strength or weakness of Imam Saheb. Imam
Saheb never walked barefooted, was fond of the good things of the
earth, had a Malay wife, kept a well-furnished house and went about
in a horse carriage. Very true, but who could read the depths of his
mind? After he was released, Imam Saheb went to jail again, lived
there as an ideal prisoner and took his meals after a spell of hard
labour. At home he would have new dishes and delicacies every day; in
jail he took mealie pap and thanked God for it. Not only was he not
defeated, but he became simple in habits. As a prisoner he broke
stones, worked as a sweeper and stood in a line with other prisoners.
At Phoenix he fetched water and even set types in the press. Everyone
at the Phoenix Ashram was bound to acquire the art of type-setting.

I too was arrested again. At one time there were as many as
seventy-five Indian prisoners in Volksrust jail. We cooked our own
food. I became the cook as only I could adjudicate on the conflicting
claims to the ration supplied. Thanks to their love for me, my
companions took without a murmur the half-cooked porridge I prepared
without sugar.</p>

And yet the Indians would not take a defeat. Government were in a
quandary. How many Indians could be sent to jail after all? And then
it meant additional expenditure. The Government began to cast about
for other means of dealing with the situation.</p>

deportation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>meant
taking the ‘culprit’ into the limits of Natal, the Orange Free
State or Portuguese East Africa beyond the Transvaal frontier and
leaving him there. As for instance, the Indians who crossed over from
Natal were taken beyond the limits of Volksrust station and there
left to their own devices. Deportation of this kind was a farce pure
and simple, as it involved only a little inconvenience, and instead
of disheartening them it only encouraged the Indians still further.</p>

The local Government therefore had to find out fresh means of
harassing the Indians. The jails were already overcrowded. The
Government thought that the Indians would be thoroughly demoralized
and would surrender at discretion if they could be deported to India.
There was some ground for this belief of the Government, who
accordingly sent a large batch of Indians to India. These deportees
suffered great hardships. They had nothing to eat except what
Government chose to provide for them on the steamers, and all of them
were sent as deck passengers. Again some of them had their landed as
well as other property and their business in South Africa, many had
their families there, while others were also in debt. Not many men
would be ready to lose their all and turn into perfect bankrupts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 110%">
All this notwithstanding, many Indians remained perfectly firm. Many
more however weakened and ceased to court arrest, although they did
not weaken to the extent of getting duplicates of the burnt
certificates. Some few were even terrorized into registering afresh.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
Still there was a considerable number of stalwarts who were so brave
that some of them, I believe, would have mounted the gallows with a
smile on their face. And if they cared little for life, they cared
still less for property.</p>

But many of those who were deported to India were poor and simple
folk who had joined the movement from mere faith. That these should
be oppressed so heavily was almost too much to bear. However, it was
difficult to see our way to assisting them. Our funds were meagre,
and then there was the danger of losing the fight altogether if we
proceeded to give monetary help. Not a single person was permitted to

I have seen from experience that money cannot go as far as
fellow-feeling, kind words and kind looks can. If a man who is eager
to get riches gets riches from another but without sympathy, he will
give him up in the long run. On the other hand, one who has been
conquered by love is ready to encounter no end of difficulties with
him who has given him his love.</p>

We therefore resolved to do for the deportees all that kindness could
do. We comforted them with the promise that proper arrangements would
be made for them in India. The reader must remember that many of them
were ex-indentured labourers, and had no relations in India. Some
were even born in South Africa, and to all India was something like a
strange land. It would be sheer cruelty if these helpless people upon
being landed in India were left to shift for themselves. We therefore
assured them that all suitable arrangements would be made for them in
India.</p>

But this was not enough. The deportees could not be comforted so long
as someone was not sent with them to be their companion and guide.
This was the first batch of deportees, and their steamer was to start
in a few hours. There was not much time for making a selection.  I
thought of P. K. Naidoo, one of my co-workers, and asked him:</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 3.2cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 118%">
“Will you escort these poor brothers to India?” “Why not?”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 4.58cm; line-height: 118%">
“But the steamer is starting just now.” “Let it.”</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; line-height: 0.44cm">“What

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">

the food from the steamer all right.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
This was a most agreeable surprise for me. The conversation took
place at Parsi Rustomji’s. There and then I procured  some clothes
and blankets for Naidoo and sent him on.</p>

never been to India before. I gave him a letter of recommendation to
Shri Natesan and also sent a cablegram.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 101%">
In those days Shri Natesan perhaps stood alone in India as a student
of the grievances of Indians abroad, their valued helper, and a
systematic and well-informed exponent of their case. I had regular
correspondence with him.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>When the deportees reached Madras, Shri Natesan rendered
them full assistance. He found his task easier for the presence of an
able man like Naidoo among the deportees. He made local collections
and did not allow the deportees to feel for a moment that they had
been deported.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 101%">
These deportations by the Transvaal Government were as illegal as
they were cruel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>People
are generally unaware that governments often deliberately violate
their own laws. In face of emergency there is no time for undertaking
fresh legislation. Governments therefore  break the laws and do what
they please. Afterwards they either enact new laws or else make the
people forget their breach of the law.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 102%">
The Indians started a powerful agitation against this lawlessness of
the local Government, which was adversely commented upon in India too
so that the Government every day found it more and more difficult to
deport poor Indians. The Indians took all possible legal steps and
successfully appealed against the deportations,  with  the result
that Government had to stop the practice of deporting to India.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
But the policy of deportations was not without its effect upon the
satyagrahi ‘army’. Not all could overcome the fear of being
deported to India. Many more fell away, and only the real fighters
remained.</p>

This was not the only step taken by the Government to break the
spirit of the community. As I have stated in the last chapter,
Government had done their utmost to harass the satyagrahi prisoners,
who were put to all manner of tasks, including breaking stones. But
that was not all. At first all prisoners were kept together. Now the
Government adopted the policy of separating them, and accorded harsh
treatment to them in every jail. Winter in the Transvaal is very
severe; the cold is so bitter that one’s hands are almost frozen
while working in the morning. Winter therefore was a hard time for

prisoners, some of whom were kept in a road camp where no one could
even go and see them. One of these prisoners was a young satyagrahi,
eighteen years old, of the name of Swami Nagappan, who observed the
jail rules and did the task entrusted to him. Early in the mornings
he was taken to work on the roads where he contracted double
pneumonia of which he died after he was released (July 7, 1909).<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Nagappan’s companions say that he thought of the
struggle and the struggle alone till he breathed his last. He never
repented having gone to jail and embraced death for his country’s
sake as he would embrace a friend. Nagappan was ‘illiterate’
according to our standards. He spoke English and Zulu from
experience. Perhaps he also wrote broken English, but he was by no
means an educated man. Still if we consider his fortitude, his
patience, his patriotism, his  firmness unto death, there is nothing
left which we might desire him to possess. The satyagraha movement
went on successfully though it was not joined by any highly educated
men, but where would it have been without soldiers like Nagappan?</p>

As Nagappan died of ill-treatment in jail, the hardships of
deportation proved to be the death of Narayanaswami (October 16,
1910).<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>Still
the community stood unmoved; only weaklings slipped away. But even
the weaklings had done their best. Let us not despise them. Those who
march forward are generally apt to look down upon those who fall back
and to consider themselves very brave fellows, whereas often the
facts are just the reverse. If a man who can afford to contribute
fifty rupees subscribes only twenty-five and if he who can afford to
pay only five rupees contributes that amount in full, he who gives
five must be held to be a more generous donor than the other who
gives five times as much. Yet very often he who contributes
twenty-five is needlessly elated at the false notion of his
superiority over the contributor of five rupees. In the same way, if
a man who falls back through weakness has done his utmost, he is
really superiorto another who leaves him behind but has not put his
whole soul into the march. Therefore even those who slipped away when
they found things too hot for them did render service to the
community. A time now came when greater calls were made on our
patience and courage. But the Transvaal Indians were not found</p>

Thus day by day the trial grew more and more severe for the Indians.
Government became more and more violent in proportion to the strength
put forth by the community. There are always special prisons where
dangerous prisoners or prisoners whom Government wants to bend are
kept, and so there were in the Transvaal. One of these was the
Diepkloof Convict Prison, where there was a harsh jailer, and where
the labour exacted from prisoners was also hard. And yet there were
Indians who successfully performed their allotted task. But though
they were prepared to work, they would not put up with the insult
offered to them by the jailer and therefore went  on hunger-strike.
They solemnly declared that they would take no food until either the
jailer was removed from the prison, or else they themselves were
transferred to another prison. This was a perfectly legitimate
strike. The strikers were quite honest and not likely to take food
secretly. The reader must remember that there was not much room in
the Transvaal for such public agitation as a case of this nature
would evoke in India. Again, jail regulations in the Transvaal were
particularly drastic. Outsiders did not seek interviews with
prisoners even on occasions of this nature. A satyagrahi, when once
he found himself in jail, had generally to shift for himself. The
struggle was on behalf of the poor and was conducted as a poor men’s
movement. And therefore the vow which these strikers took was fraught
with great risk. However, they were firm and succeeded in getting
themselves transferred to another prison after a seven days’ fast. 
As  hunger-strikes were a rarity in those days,  these  satyagrahis 
are entitled to special credit as pioneers (November, 1910).</p>

Thus the satyagrahis were being imprisoned or deported. There was
sometimes a lull and then a storm, but both the partieshad somewhat
weakened. The Government saw that they could not hope to subdue the
satyagrahi stalwarts by sending them to jail, and the policy of
deportations had only put themselves in a false position. The
Government also lost some cases which were taken to the courts. The
Indians on their part were not in a position to put up a strong
fight. There was not even a sufficient number of satyagrahis for  the
 purpose. Some Indians were warweary, while others had become</p>

entirely defeatist and therefore looked upon the staunch satyagrahis
as so many fools. The ‘fools’ however knew themselves to be wise
and had full faith in God, in their cause and in the righteousness of
the means they had selected to promote it. They were confident that
great is Truth and it shall prevail in the end.</p>

Meanwhile, there was continuous movement in South African politics.
The Boers and the British were anxious to secure a higher status by
effecting a union of the various Colonies in the sub-continent.
General Hertzog stood for a total breach of the British connection
while others preferred to keep up a nominal association with the
British Empire. Englishmen would never agree to a total secession,
and any higher status in view could only be  attained  through the
British Parliament. The Boers and the British in South Africa
therefore decided that a deputation should visit England on their
behalf and present their case before the British Cabinet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
The Indians observed that in case of a union of the Colonies their
last state would be worse than their first. All the Colonies were
ever desirous of suppressing the Indians, and it was clear in view of
their anti-Indian tendency that it would go very hard with the
community when they came closer together. In order that not a single
avenue might remain unexplored, the Indians resolved to send once
again a deputation to England, although there was every likelihood of
their small voice being drowned in the loud roar of British and Boer
lions. On this occasion Sheth Haji Habib, a Memon gentleman from
Porbandar, was appointed as my colleague on the deputation. The Sheth
carried on a long established trade in the Transvaal andwas a man of
wide experience. He had not received English education, yet he easily
understood English, Dutch, Zulu and other languages. His sympathies
were with the satyagrahis but he could not be described as a full
satyagrahi himself. Mr. Merriman, the veteran statesman  of South
Africa, was our fellow passenger on board s.s.  <i>Kenilworth Castle</i>,
which took us to England, leaving Cape Townon June 23, 1909. He was
going with a view to the unificationof the Colonies. General Smuts
and others were already in England. A separate deputation of the
Indians in Natal also visited England about this time in connection
with their special grievances.</p>

At this time Lord Crewe was Secretary of State for the Colonies and
Lord Morley Secretary of State for India. There were many
discussions, and we interviewed a large number of people. There was</p>

hardly a journalist or member of either House whom it was possible to
meet but whom we did not meet. Lord Ampthill rendered  us invaluable
help. He used to meet Mr. Merriman, General Botha and others and at
last he brought a message from the General. Said he: “General Botha
appreciates your feelings in the matter, and is willing to grant your
minor demands. But he is not ready to repeal the Asiatic Act or to
amend the Immigrants Restriction Act. He also refuses to remove the
colour bar which has been set up in the law of the land. To maintain
the racial bar is a matter of principle with the General and even if
he felt like doing away with it the South African Europeans would
never listen to him. General Smuts is of the same mind as General
Botha, and this is their final decision and final offer. If you ask
for more you will only be inviting trouble for yourself as well as
for your people. Therefore whatever you do, do it after giving due
consideration to this attitude of the Boer leaders. General Botha has
asked me to tell you this and give you an  idea  of your
responsibility.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
And after delivering the message Lord Ampthill said, “You see that
General Botha concedes all your practical demands, and in this
work-a-day world we must always give and take. We cannot have
everything that we desire. I would therefore strongly advise you to
close with this offer. If you wish to fight for principle’s sake,
you may do so later on. You and the Sheth think over this, and let me
have your reply at your convenience.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; line-height: 102%">
Upon hearing this I looked to Sheth Haji Habib, who said, “Tell him
from me that I accept General Botha’s offer on behalf of the
conciliation party. If he makes these concessions, we will be
satisfied for the present and later on struggle for principle. I do
not like the community to suffer any more. The party I represent
constitutes the majority of the community, and it also holds the
major portion of the community’s wealth.”</p>

I translated the Sheth’s sentences word by word, and then on behalf
of the satyagrahis I said: “We are both highly obliged  to youfor
the trouble you have taken. My colleague is right when he says that
he represents a numerically and financially stronger section. The
Indians for whom I speak are comparatively poor and inferior in
numbers, but they are resolute unto death. They are fighting not only
for practical relief but for principle as well. If they must give up
either of the two, they will jettison the former and fight for the
latter. We</p>

“You must not suppose that I will give you up. I too must play the

you can realize my delicate position. The suffering, if any, must be
borne by you alone, and therefore it is my duty to advise you to
accept any settlement possible in the circumstances. But if you, who
have to suffer, are prepared to undergo any amount of suffering for
principle’s sake, I must not only not come in your way but even
congratulate you. I will therefore continue as President of your
Committee and help you to the best of my ability. But you must

I will close this chapter with a not quite relevant paragraph. During
my stay in England I had occasion to talk with many Indian
anarchists. My booklet <i>Indian </i><i>Home Rule</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

s.s. <i>Kildonan </i><i>Castle </i>(November, 1909) and published
soon afterwards in <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion</i>, had its birth from
the necessity of having to meet their arguments as well as to solve
the difficulties of Indians in South Africa who held similar  views.
I had also discussed the main points of the book with Lord Ampthill
in order that he might not feel for one moment that I had misused his
name and his help for my work in South Africa by suppressing my
views.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>This
discussion with Lord Ampthill has always remained imprinted on my
memory. He found time to meet me in spite of illness in his family
and, although he did not agree with my views as expressed in <i>Hind

last, and my relations with him were always cordial.</p>

draw from our conversations with Lort Ampthill. I knew who would
stand by us till the end. My ideas about satyagraha had now matured
and I had realized its universality as well as its excellence. I was
therefore perfectly at ease. Hind Swaraj was written in order to
demonstrate the sublimity of satyagraha and that book is a true

But this or even the largest possible gift of money could not by
itself help forward a satyagraha struggle, a fight on behalf of Truth
consisting chiefly in self-purification and self-reliance. A
satyagraha struggle is impossible without capital in the shape of
character. As a splendid palace deserted by its inmates looks like a
ruin, so does a man without character, all his material belongings
notwithstanding. The satyagrahis now saw that no one could tell how
long the struggle would last. On the one hand there were the Boer
Generals determined not to yield even an inch of ground and on the
other there was a handful of satyagrahis pledged to fight unto death
or victory. It was like a war between ants and the elephant who could
crush thousands of them under each of his feet. The satyagrahis could
not impose a time limit upon their satyagraha. Whether it lasted one
year or many, it was all the same to them. For them the struggle
itself was victory. Fighting meant imprisonment or deportation for
them. But what about their families in the meanwhile? No one would
engage as an employee  a man who was constantly going to jail and,
when he was released, how was he to maintain himself as well as those
dependent on him? Where was he to lodge and where was his house rent
to come from? Even a satyagrahi may be excused if he feels troubled
at heart from want of his daily bread. There cannot be many in the
world who would fight the good fight in spite of being compelled to
condemn their nearest and dearest to the same starvation which they
suffered in their own person.</p>

without any family responsibilities. Nor was it possible to recruit
only <i>brahmacharis </i>for our ‘army’. The principle generally
observed was, that each family was asked to name the minimum amount
adequate to its needs and was paid accordingly on trust. There was
considerable room here for fraud, of which some rogues did not fail
to take advantage. Others who were honest but who were accustomed to
live in a particular style naturally expected such help as would
enable them to keep it up. I saw that at this rate the movement could
not be conducted for any length of time. There was always the risk of
injustice being done to the deserving, and undue advantage being
taken by the unscrupulous. There was only one solution for this
difficulty, namely, that all the families should be kept at one place
and should become members of a sort of co-operative commonwealth.
Thus there would be no scope for fraud, nor would there be injustice
to any. Public funds would be largely saved and the families of
satyagrahis would be trained to live a  new  and  simple  life  in
harmony with one another. Indians belonging to various provinces and
professing divers faiths would have an opportunity of living
together.</p>

But where was the place suitable for a settlement of this nature? To
live in a city would have been like straining at a gnat and
swallowing a camel. The house rent alone would perhaps amount to the
same sum as the food bill, and it would not be easy to live a simple
life amidst the varied distractions of a city. Again in a city it
would be impossible to find a place where many families could
prosecute some useful industry in their own homes. It was therefore
clear that the place selected should be neither too far from nor too
near a city. There was of course Phoenix, where <i>Indian Opinion </i>was
being printed and where there was also some cultivation being carried
on. Phoenix was also convenient in many other ways, but it was three
hundred miles away from Johannesburg and to be reached by a journey
of thirty hours. It was therefore difficult and expensive to take 
the families such a distance and bring them back again. Besides, the
families would not be ready to leave their homes for such a far of
place, and even if they were ready it seemed impossible to send them
as well as the satyagrahi prisoners on their release.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

Johannesburg. Mr. Kallenbach, whose acquaintance the reader has

Here we insisted that we should not have any servants either for the
household work or, as far as might be, even for the farming and
building operations. Everything therefore from cooking to scavenging
was done with our own hands. As regards accommodation for families,
we resolved from the first that the  men  and  women should be housed
separately. The houses therefore were to be built in two separate
blocks, each at some distance from the other. For the time it was
considered sufficient to provide accommodation for ten women and
sixty men. Then again we had to erect a house for Mr. Kallenbach and
by its side a school house, as well as a workshop for carpentry,
shoemaking, etc.</p>

coming over here in their days of adversity, to give up meat even
temporarily? But if they were given meat, would not that swell our
cost of living? Again, should those who were accustomedto taking beef
be given that too? How many separate kitchens must be run in that
case? What was my duty on this point? Having been instrumental in
giving monetary help to these families, I had already given my
support to meat-eating as well as beef-eating. If I made a rule that
meat-eaters should not be helped, I would have to prosecute the 
satyagraha struggle through vegetarians only, which was absurd as the
movement had been organized on behalf of all classes of Indians. I

But where love is, there God is also. The Mussalman friends had
already granted me permission to have a purely vegetarian kitchen. I
had now to approach Christian sisters whose husbands or sons were in
jail. I had often come in such intimate contact with the Christian
friends who were now in jail and who had on similar occasions
consented to having a vegetarian dietary. But this was the first time
that I had to deal at close quarters with their families in their
absence.  I represented to the sisters the difficulty of housing
accommodation as well as of finance and my own deep-rooted sentiment
in the matter. At the same time I assured them that even beef would
be provied for them if they wanted it. The sisters kindly consented
to have no meat, and the cooking department was placed in their
charge. I with or without another man was detailed to assist them. My
presence acted as a check upon petty bickerings. The food was to be
the simplest possible. The time as well as the number of meals was
fixed. There was to be one single kitchen, and all were to dine in a
single row. Everyone was to see to the cleaning of his own dish and
other things. The common pots were to be cleaned by different parties
in turn. I must state that satyagrahis lived on Tolstoy Farm for a
long time, but neither the women nor the men ever asked for meat.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

lived in tents for about two months while the buildings, were under
construction. The structures were all of corrugated iron and
therefore did not take long to raise. The timber too could be had
ready made in all sizes required. All we had to do was to cut it to
measure. There were not many doors or windows to be prepared. Hence
it was that quite a number of buildings could be erected within such
a short space of time. But all this labour was a heavy tax on
Pragji’s physical constitution. The work on the Farm was certainly
harder than that in jail. One day Pragji actually fainted, thanks to
fatigue and heat. But he was not the man to give in. He fully trained

liked to go there just for the fun of it. I also had to go there on

travel third class. Anyone who wanted to go on a pleasure trip must
go on foot, and carry home-made provisions with him. No one might
spend anything on his food in the city. Had it not been for these

the Farm. We scarcely used cow’s milk on the Farm and generally
managed with condensed milk.</p>

But to return to the trips. Anyone who wished to go to Johannesburg
went there on foot once or twice a week and returned the same day. As
I have already stated, it was a journey of 21 miles and back. We
saved hundreds of rupees by this one rule of going on foot, and those
who thus went walking were much benefited. Some newly acquired the
habit of walking. The general practice was that the sojourner should
rise at two o’clock and start at half past two. He would reach
Johannesburg in six to seven hours. The record for the minimum time
taken on the journey was 4 hours 18 minutes.</p>

The reader must not imagine that this discipline operated upon the
settlers at all as a hardship. On the other hand it was accepted
cheerfully. It would have been impossible to have a single settler if
force had been employed. The youngsters thoroughly enjoyed the work
on the Farm and the errands to the city. It was difficult to prevent
them from playing their pranks while engaged in work. No more work
was given to them than what they willingly and cheerfully rendered,
and I never found that the work thus done was unsatisfactory either
in quantity or in quality.</p>

A paragraph may be devoted to our sanitary arrangements. In spite  of
 the  large  number  of settlers,  one  could  not  find  refuse or
dirt anywhere on the Farm. All rubbish was buried in trenches dug for
the purpose. No water was permitted to be thrown on the roads. All
waste water was collected in buckets and used to water the trees.
Leavings of food and vegetable refuse were utilized as manure. A
square pit one foot and a half deep was sunk near the house to
receive the night-soil, which was fully covered with the excavated
earth and which therefore did not give out any smell. There were no
flies, and no one would imagine that night-soil had been buried
there. We were thus not only spared a nuisance, but the source of
possible nuisance was converted into invaluable manure for the Farm.
If night-soil was properly utilized, we would get manure worth lakhs
of rupees and also secure immunity from a number of diseases. By our
bad habits we</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
spoil our sacred river banks and furnish excellent breeding grounds
for flies with the result that the very flies which through our
criminal negligence settle upon uncovered night-soil defile our
bodies after we have bathed. A small spadeis the means of salvation
from a great nuisance. Leaving night-soil, cleaning the nose or
spitting on the road is a sin against God aswell as humanity, and
betrays a sad want of consideration for others. The man who does not
cover his waste deserves a heavy penalty even if he lives in a
forest.</p>

The work before us was to make the Farm a busy hive of industry, thus
to save money and in the end to make the families self-supporting. If
we achieved this goal, we could battle with the Transvaal Government
for an indefinite period. We had to spend some money on shoes. The
use of shoes in a hot climate is harmful, as all the perspiration is
absorbed by the feet which thus grow tender. No socks were needed in
the Transvaal as in India, but we thought that the feet must be
protected against thorns, stones and the like. We therefore
determined to learn to make sandals. There is at Mariann Hill near
Pinetown a monastery of German Catholic monks called the Trappists,
where industries of this nature are carried on. Mr. Kallenbach went
there and acquired the art of making sandals. After he returned, he
taught it to me and I in my turn to other workers. Thus several young
men learnt how to manufacture sandals, and we commenced selling them
to friends. I need scarcely say that many of my pupils easily
surpassed me in the art. Another handicraft introduced was that of
carpentry. Having founded a sort of village we needed all manner of
things large and small from benches to boxes, and we made them all
ourselves. The selfless carpenters already referred to helped us for
several months. Mr. Kallenbach was the head of the carpentry
department, and as such every moment gave us the evidence of his
mastery and exactitude.</p>

thoroughly exhausted by our morning labour, and so were our pupils.
The teachers therefore would often be dozing as well as the taught.
We would sprinkle water on the eyes, and by playing with the children
try to pull them up and to pull up ourselves, but sometimes in vain.
The body peremptorily demanded rest and would not take a denial. But
this was only one and the leastof our many difficulties. For the
classes were conducted inspite of these dozings. What were we to
teach pupils who spoke one of the languages, Gujarati, Tamil or
Telugu, and how?  I was anxious to make these languages the medium of
instruction. I knew a little Tamil but no Telugu. What could one
teacher do in these circumstances? I tried to use some of the young
men as teachers, but the experiment was not altogether a success.
Pragji’s services were of course requisitioned. Some of the
youngsters were very mischievous and lazy and were always on bad
terms with their books. A teacher could not expect to make much
headway with such pupils. Again we could not be regular in our
teaching. Business sometimes took Mr. Kallenbach as well as me to
Johannesburg.</p>

Religious teaching presented another tough problem.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

the Avesta. There was one Khoja child, whose father had laid upon me
the responsibility of teaching him a small <i>pothi</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

Zoroastrianism. I wrote out the fundamental doctrines of Hinduism
according to my lights,—I forget now whether it was for my own
children or for the Tolstoy Farmers. If this document were now in my
possession, I should have inserted it here as a landmark in my
spiritual progress. But I have thrown away or burnt many such things
in my life. I destroyed such papers, as I felt it was not necessary
to preserve them or as the scope of my activities was extended. I am
not sorry for this, as to have presented all of them would have been
burdensome and expensive. I should have been compelled to keep
cabinets and boxes, which would have been an eyesore to one who has
taken the vow of poverty.</p>

But this teaching experiment was not fruitless. The children were
saved from the infection of intolerance, and learnt to view one
another’s religions and customs with a large-hearted charity. They
learnt how to live together like blood-brothers. They imbibed the

A teacher hardly ever had to teach the kind of heterogeneous class
that fell to my lot, containing as it did pupils of all ages and both
the sexes, from boys and girls of about seven years of age to young
men of twenty and young girls 12 or 13 years old. Some of the boys
were wild and mischievous.</p>

What was I to teach this ill-assorted group? How was I to be all
things to all pupils? Again in what language should I talk to all of
them? The Tamil and Telugu children knew their own mother tongue or
English and a little Dutch. I could speak to them only in English. I
divided the class into two sections, the Gujarati section to be
talked to in Gujarati and the rest in English. As the principal part
of the teaching, I arranged to tell or read to them some interesting
stories. I also proposed to bring them into close mutual contact and
to lead them to cultivate a spirit of friendship and service. Then
there was to be imparted some general knowledge of history and
geography and in some cases of arithmetic. Writing was also taught,
and so were some <i>bhajans </i>which formed part of our prayers, and
to which therefore I tried to attract the Tamil children as well.</p>

The boys and girls met freely. My experiment of co-education on
Tolstoy Farm was the most fearless of its type. I dare not today
allow, or train children to enjoy, the liberty which I had granted
the Tolstoy Farm class. I have often felt that my mind then used to
be more innocent than it is now, and that was due perhaps to my
ignorance. Since then I have had bitter experiences, and  have
sometimes burnt my fingers badly. Persons whom I took to be
thoroughly innocent have turned out corrupt. I have observed the</p>

I do not repent having made the experiment. My conscience bears
witness that it did not do any harm. But as a child who has burnt
himself with hot milk blows even into whey, my present attitude is
one of extra caution.</p>

A man cannot borrow faith or courage from others. The doubter is
marked out for destruction, as the <i>Gita </i>puts it. My faith and
courage were at their highest in Tolstoy Farm. I have been praying to
God to permit me to re-attain that height, but theprayer has not yet
been heard, for the number of such suppliants before the Great White
Throne is legion. The only consolation is that God has as many ears
as there are suppliants. I therefore repose full faith in Him and
know that my prayer will be accepted when I have fitted myself for
such grace.</p>

This was my experiment. I sent the boys reputed to be mischievous and
the innocent young girls to bathe in the same spot at the same time.
I had fully explained the duty of self-restraint to the children, who
were all familiar with my satyagraha doctrine. I knew, and so did the
children, that I loved them with a mother’s love. The reader will
remember the spring at some distance from the kitchen. Was it folly
to let the children meet there for bath and yet to expect them to be
innocent? My eye always followed the girls as a mother’s eye would
follow a daughter. The time was fixed when all the boys and all the
girls went together for a bath. There was an element of safety in the
fact that they went in a body. Solitude was  always  avoided.
Generally I also would be at the spring at the same time.</p>

All of us slept in an open verandah. The boys and the girls would
spread themselves around me. There was hardly a distance of three
feet between any two beds. Some care was exercised  in arranging the
order of the beds, but any amount of such care would have been futile
in the case of a wicked mind. I now see that God alone safeguarded
the honour of these boys and girls. I made the experiment from a
belief that boys and girls could thus live together without harm, and
the parents with their boundless faith in me allowed me to make it.</p>

One day one of the young men made fun of two girls, and the girls
themselves or some child brought me the information. The news made me
tremble. I made inquiries and found that the report was true.</p>

I remonstrated with the young men, but that was not enough. I wished
the two girls to have some sign on their person as a warning to every
young man that no evil eye might be cast upon them, and as a lesson
to every girl that no one dare assail their purity. The passionate 
Ravana could not so much as touch Sita with evil intent while Rama
was thousands of miles away. What mark should the girls bear so as to
give them a sense of security and at the same time to sterilize the
sinner’s eye? This question kept me awake for the night. In the
morning I gently suggested to the girls that they might let me cut
offtheir fine long hair. On the Farm we shaved and cut the hair of
one another, and we therefore kept scissors and clipping machinesAt
first the girls would not listen to me. I had already explained the
situation to the elderly women who could not bear to think of my
suggestion but yet quite understood my motive, and they to had
finally accorded their support to me. They were both of them noble
girls. One of them is—alas!—now no more. She was very bright and
intelligent.  The other is living and the mistress of a household of
her own. They came round after all, and at once the very hand that is
narrating this incident set to cut off their hair. And afterwards I
analysed and explained my procedure before my class, with excellent
results. I never heard of a joke again. The girls in question did not
lose in any case, goodness knows how much they gained. I hoped the
young men still remember this incident and keep their eyes from sin.</p>

Experiments such as I have placed on record are not meant for
imitation. Any teacher who imitated them would be incurring grave
risk. I have here taken note of them only to show how far a man can
go in certain circumstances and to stress the purity of the
satyagraha struggle. This very purity was a guarantee of its victory.
Before launching on such experiments a teacher has to be both father
and mother to his pupils and to be prepared for all eventualities
whatever, and only the hardest penance can fit him to conduct them.</p>

This act of mine was not without its effect on the entire life of the
settlers on the Farm. As we had intended to cut down expenses to the
barest minimum, we changed our dress also. In the cities  the Indian
men including the satyagrahis put on European dress. Such elaborate
clothing was not needed on the Farm. We had all become labourers and
therefore put on labourers’ dress but in the European style, <i>viz.</i>,
working men’s trousers and shirts, which were imitated from
prisoners’ uniform. We all used cheap trousers and shirts which
could</p>

As for food we generally had rice, dal, vegetable and <i>rotlis</i>,
with porridge occasionally added. All this was served in a singledish
which was not really a dish, but a kind of bowl such as is supplied
to  prisoners in jail. We had made wooden spoons on the Farm
ourselves. There were three meals in the day. We had bread and
home-made wheaten “coffee”<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

at eleven, and wheat pap and milk, or breadand “coffee” at half
past five in the evening. After the eveningmeal we had prayers at
seven or half past seven. At prayerswe sang <i>bhajans </i>and
sometimes had readings from the <i>Ramayana </i>or books on Islam.
The <i>bhajans </i>were in English, Hindi and Gujarati. Sometimes we
had one <i>bhajan </i>from each of the three languages, and sometimes
only one. Everyone retired at 9 o’clock.</p>

Many observed the <i>Ekadashi </i>fast on the Farm. We were joined
there by Shri P. K. Kotval who had much experience of fasting, and
some of us followed him to keep the <i>chaturmas</i>. Ramzan also
arrived in the meanwhile. There were Mussalman youngsters among us,
and we felt we must encourage them to keep the fasts. We arranged for
them to have meals in the evening as well as in the early morning.
Porridge, etc., were prepared for them in the evening. There was no
meat of course, nor did anyone ask for it. To keep the Mussalman
friends company the rest of us had only one meal a day  in  the
evening. As a rule we finished our evening meal before sunset; so the
only difference was that the others finished their supper about when
the Mussalman boys commenced theirs. These boys were so courteous
that they did not put anyone to extra trouble although they were
observing fasts, and the fact that the non-Muslim children supported
them in the matter of fasting left a good impression on all. I do not
remember that there ever was a quarrel, much less a split, between
the Hindu and the Mussalman boys on the score of religion. On the
other hand I know that although staunch in their own beliefs, they
all treated one another with respect and assisted one another in
their respective religious observances.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup></p>

Although we were living far from the amenities of city life, we did
not keep even the commonest appliances against the possible attacks
of illness. I had in those days as much faith in the nature-cure of
disease as I had in the innocence of children. I felt that there
should not be disease as we lived a simple life, but if there was, I
was confident of dealing with it. My booklet on health<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

out of the question. I held that all kinds of diseases could be cured
by earth and water treatment, fasting or changes in diet. There was
not a single case of illness on the Farm in which we used drugs or
called in a doctor. There was an oldman from North India 70 years of
age who suffered from asthma and cough, but who was cured simply by
changes in diet and water treatment. But I have now lost the courage,
and in view of my two serious illnesses I feel that I have forfeited

South Africa while we were still living on the Farm. His tour must be

half-sweet, half-bitter reminiscence. The reader has now some idea of
the sort of life we were leading. There was no cot on the Farm, but
we borrowed one for Gokhale. There was no room where he could enjoy
full privacy. For sitting accommodation we had nothing beyond the
benches in our school. Even so, how could we resist the temptation of
bringing Gokhale, in spite of his delicate health, to the Farm? And
how could he help seeing it, either? I was foolish enough to imagine
that Gokhale would be able to put up with a night’s discomfort and
to walk about a mile and a half from the station to the Farm. I had
asked him beforehand, and he had agreed to everything without
bestowing any thought upon it, thanks to his simplicity and
overwhelming confidence in me. It rained that day, as fate would have
it, and I was not in a position suddenly to make any special
arrangement. I have never forgotten the trouble to which I put
Gokhale that day in my ignorant affection. The hardship was too much
for him to bear and he caught a chill. We could not take him to the
kitchen and dining-hall. He had been put up in Mr. Kallenbach’s</p>

room. His dinner would get cold while we brought it from the kitchen
to his room. I prepared special soup, and Kotval special bread for
him, but these could not be taken to him hot. We managed as best we
could. Gokhale uttered not a syllable, but I understood from his face
what a folly I had committed. When Gokhale came to know that all of
us slept on the floor, he removed the cot which had been brought for
him and had his own bed too spread on the floor. This whole night was
a night of repentance for me. Gokhale had a rule in life which seemed
to me a bad rule. He would not permit anyone except a  servant to
wait upon him. He had no servant with him during this tour. Mr.
Kallenbach and I entreated him to let us massage his feet. But he
would not let us even touch him, and half jocularly, half angrily
said: “You all seem to think that you have been born to suffer
hardships and discomforts, and people like myself have been born to
be  pampered by you. You must suffer today the punishment for
thisextremism of yours. I will not let you even touch me. Do you
think that you will go out to attend to nature’s needs and at the
same time keep a commode for me? I will bear any amount of hardship
but  I will humble your pride.” These words were to us like a
thunderbolt, and deeply grieved Mr. Kallenbach and me. The only
consolation was that Gokhale wore a smile on his face all the while.
Krishna no doubt was often deeply offended by Arjuna, “unknowing of
His majesty and careless in the fondness of his love,” but he soon
forgot such incidents. Gokhale remembered only our will to serve,
though he did not accord us the high privilege of serving him. The
deeply affectionate letter he wrote me from Mombasa is still
imprinted upon my heart. Gokhale bore everything cheerfully, but till
the last never accepted the service which it was in our power to
render. He had to take the food, etc., from our hands, but that he
could not help.</p>

The next morning he allowed no rest either to himself or to us. He
corrected all his speeches which we proposed to publish in book-form.
When he had to write anything, he was in the habit of walking to and
fro and thinking it out. He had to write a small letter and I thought
that he would soon have done with it. But no. As I twitted him upon
it, he read me a little homily: “You do not know my ways of life. I
will not do even the least little thing in a hurry. I will think
about it and consider the central idea. I will next deliberate as to
the language suited to the subject and then set to write. If everyone
did as I do, what a huge saving of time would there be? And the
nation would be saved from the avalanche of half-baked ideas which</p>

As the reminiscences of Tolstoy Farm would be incomplete without an
account of Gokhale’s visit thereto, so would they be if I omitted
to say something about the character and conduct of Mr. Kallenbach.
It was really a wonder how he lived on Tolstoy Farm among our people
as if he were one of us. Gokhale was not the man to be attracted by
ordinary things. But even he felt strongly drawn to the revolutionary
change in Kallenbach’s life. Kallenbach had been brought up in the
lap of luxury and had never known what privation was. In fact,
indulgence had been his religion. He had had his fill of all the
pleasures of life, and he had never hesitated to secure for his
comfort everything that money could buy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
It was no ordinary thing for such a man to live, move and have his
being on Tolstoy Farm, and to become one with the Indian settlers.
This was an agreeable surprise for the Indians. Some Europeans
classed Kallenbach either as a fool or a lunatic, while others
honoured him for his spirit of renunciation. Kallenbach never felt
his renunciation to be painful. In fact he enjoyed it even more than
he had enjoyed the pleasures of life before. He would be transported
with rapture while describing the bliss of a simple life, and for a
moment his hearers would be tempted to go in for it. He mixed so
lovingly with the young as well as the old, that separation from him
even for a short time left a clearly felt void in their lives. Mr.
Kallenbach was very fond of fruit trees and therefore he reserved
gardening as his own portfolio. Every morning he would engage
children as well as grown-up people in tending the fruit trees. He
would make them work hard, but he had such a cheerful temper and
smiling face,  that  everyone loved to work with him. Whenever a
party of tourists left the Farm for Johannesburg at 2 a.m., Mr.
Kallenbach would always be one of them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; line-height: 95%">
Mr. Kallenbach and I had frequent talks on religion, which usually
centred on fundamentals like non-violence or love, truth and the
like. When I said that it was a sin to kill snakes and such other
animals, Mr. Kallenbach was shocked to hear it as my numerous other
European friends had been. But in the end he admitted the truth of
that principle in the abstract. At the very beginning of my
intercourse with him, Mr. Kallenbach had seen the propriety and the
duty of carrying out in practice every principle of which he was
convinced intellectually, and therefore he had been able to effect
momentous changes in his life without a moment’s sitation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.17cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Now if it was improper to kill serpents and the like, we must
cultivate their friendship, thought Mr. Kallenbach. He therefore
first collected books on snakes in order to identify different
species of reptiles. He there read that not all snakes are poisonous
and some of them actually serve as protectors of field-crops. He
taught us all to recognize different kinds of snakes and at last
tamed a huge cobra which was found on the Farm. Mr. Kallenbach fed it
every day with his own hands. I gently argued with him: “Although
you do all this in a friendly spirit, your friendliness may not be
quite clear to the cobra, especially as your kindness is not
unalloyed with fear. Neitheryou nor  I have the courage to play with
it if it was free, and what we should really cultivate is courage of
that stamp. Thereforethough there is friendliness, there is not love
in this act of taming the cobra. Our behaviour   should   be   such  
that   the   cobra   can    see    through  it. We see every day that
all animals grasp at once whetherthe other party loves or fears them.
Again you do not think the cobra to be venomous, and have imprisoned
it in order to study its ways and habits. This is a kind of
self-indulgence for which there should be no room in the case of real
friendship.”</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
My argument appealed to Mr. Kallenbach, but he could not bring
himself all at once to release the cobra. I did not exercise any
pressure upon him. I too was taking interest in the life of the
cobra, and the children, of course, enjoyed it immensely. No one was
allowed to harass the cobra, which however was casting about for some
means of escape. Whether the door of the cage was inadvertently left
open, or whether the cobra managed to open it, in a couple of days
Mr. Kallenbach found the cage empty as he one morning proceeded to
call upon his friend. Mr. Kallenbach was glad of it and so was I. But
thanks to this taming experiment, snakes became a frequent subject of
our talk. Mr. Kallenbach brought to the Farm a poor and disabled
German named Albrecht who was so hump-backed that he could not walk
without supporting himself on a stick. Albrecht had boundless
courage, and being an educated man, took deep interest in recondite
problems. He too had become one with the Indian settlers and mixed
freely with all. He began fearlessly to play with snakes. He would
bring young snakes in his hand and let them play on his palm. If our
stay on Tolstoy Farm had been further prolonged, goodness knows what
would have been the upshot of Albrecht’s adventures.</p>

As a result of these experiments we did not fear snakes as much as we
otherwise might have, but it must not be supposed that no one on the
Farm feared serpents or that there was a total prohibition  against
killing them. To have a conviction that there is violence or sin in a
certain course of conduct is one thing; to have the power of acting
up to that conviction is quite another. A person who fears snakes and
who is not ready to resign his own life cannot avoid killing snakes
in case of emergency. I remember one such incident, which occurred on
the Farm. The reader must already have seen that the Farm was pretty
well infested with snakes. There was no human population on the Farm
when we occupied it, and it had been in this deserted condition for
some time. One day a snake was found in Mr. Kallenbach’s own room
at such a place that it seemed impossible to drive it away or to
catch it. One of the students saw it, and calling me there, asked me
what was to be done. He wanted my permission to kill it. He could
have killed it without such permission, but the settlers, whether
students or others,would not generally take such a step without
consulting me. I saw that it was my duty to permit the student to
kill the snake, and I permitted him. Even as I am writing this, I do
not feel that I did anything wrong in granting the permission. I had
not the courage to seize the serpent with the hand or otherwise to
remove the danger to the settlers, and I have not cultivated  such
courage to this day.</p>

Needless to say, there was on the Farm an ebb and flow of
satyagrahis, some of whom would be expecting to go to prison while
others had been released from it. Once it so happened that there
arrived at the Farm two satyagrahis who had been released by the
magistrate on personal recognizance and who had to attend the court
the next day to receive the sentence. They were engrossed in talk,
while time was up for the last train they must catch, and it was a
question whether they would succeed in taking that train. They were
both young men and good athletes. They ran for all they were worth
along with some of us who wanted to see them off. While still on the
way, I heard the whistle of the train as it steamed into the station.
When there was a second whistle indicating its departure, we had,
reached the precincts of the station. The young men increased their
speed every moment, and I lagged behind them. The train started.
Fortunately the station-master saw them running up and stopped the
moving train, thus enabling them to take it after all. I tendered my
thanks to the station-master when I reached the station. Two points</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
emerge out of this incident: first, the eagerness of the satyagrahis
in seeking jail and in fulfilling their promises, and second, the
sweet relations cultivated by the satyagrahis with the local
officers. If the young men had missed that train, they could not have
attended the court the next day. No surety had been required of them,
nor had they been asked to deposit any money with the court. They had
been released only on the word of gentlemen. The satyagrahis had
acquired such prestige thatmagistrates did not think it necessary to
ask them for bail as they were courting jail. The young satyagrahis
therefore were deeply pained at the prospect of missing the train,
and ran swift as the wind At the commencement of the struggle
satyagrahis were somewhat harassed by officials, and the jail
authorities in some places were unduly severe. But as the movement
advanced, we found that the bitterness of the officials was softened
and in some cases  even  changed to sweetness. And where there was
long  continued intercourse with them, they even began to assist us
like the station-master</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
I have referred to. The reader must not imagine thatsatyagrahis
bribed these officials in any shape or form in order to secure
amenities from them. The satyagrahis never thought of purchasing such
irregular facilities. But where facilities were offered through
courtesy, they were freely accepted, and the satyagrahis had been
enjoying such facilities in many places. If a station-master is
ill-disposed, he can harass passengers in a variety of ways, keeping
himself all the while within the four corners of the rules and
regulations. No complaint can be preferred against such harassment.
On the other hand if the official is well disposed, he can grant many
facilities without violating the rules. All such facilities we had
been able to secure from the stationmaster, Lawley,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and that because of the courtesy, the patience and the
capacity for self-suffering of the satyagrahis.</p>

It will not perhaps be amiss here to take note of an irrelevant
incident. I have been fond for about the last thirty-five  years  of
making experiments in dietetics from the religious, economic and
hygienic standpoints. This predilection for food reform still
persists. People around me would naturally be influenced by my
experiments. Side by side with dietetics, I made experiments in
treating diseases</p>

with natural curative agents only such as earth and water and without
recourse to drugs. When I practised as a barrister, cordial relations
were established with my clients so that we looked upon one another
almost as members of the same family. The clients thereforemade me a
partner in their joys and sorrows. Some of them sought my advice
being familiar with my experiments in nature-cure. Stray patients of
this class would sometimes arrive at Tolstoy Farm. One of these was
Lutavan, an aged client who first came from North India as an
indentured labourer. He was over seventy years old and suffered from
chronic    asthma    and    cough.    He     had     given     long  
  trials to <i>vaidyas</i>’ powders and doctors’ mixtures. In
those days I had boundless faith in the efficacy of my methods of
curing disease, and therefore I agreed not indeed to treat him but to
try my experiments upon him if he lived on the Farm and observed all
my conditions. Lutavan complied with my conditions. One of these was
thathe should give up tobacco to which he was strongly addicted. I
made him fast for 24 hours. At noon everyday I commenced giving him a
Kuhne bath in the sun, as the weather then was not extra warm. For
food he had a little rice, some olive oil, honey, and along with
honey, porridge and sweet oranges sometimes and at other times grapes
and wheaten coffee. Salt and all condiments whatever were avoided.
Lutavan slept in the same building as myself but in the inner
apartment. For bed everyone was given two blankets, one for spreading
and the other for covering purposes, and a wooden pillow. A week
passed. There was an accession of energy in Lutavan’s body. His
asthma and cough gave less trouble, but he had more fits at night
than by day. I suspected he was smoking secretly, and I asked him if
he did. Lutavan said he did not. A couple of days passed and as still
there was no improvement, I determined to watch Lutavan secretly.
Everyone slept on the floor, and the place was full of snakes. Mr.
Kallenbach had therefore given me an electric torch and kept one
himself. I always slept with this torch by my side. One night I
resolved to lie in the bed awake. My bed was spread on the verandah
just near the door, and Lutavan slept inside but also near the door.
Lutavan coughed at midnight, lighted a cigarette and began to smoke.
I slowly went up to his bed  and switched on the torch. Lutavan
understood everything and became nervous. He ceased smoking, stood up
and touched my feet. “I have done a great wrong,” he said. “I
will never smoke again henceforth. I have deceived you. Please excuse
me.” So saying he almost began to sob. I consoled him and said that
it was in his interest not to smoke.</p>

His cough should have been cured according to my calculations, and
when I found that he was still suffering from it, I had suspected
that he was smoking secretly. Lutavan gave up smoking. His asthma and
cough grew less severe in two or  three  days,  and  in  a  month  he
was perfectly cured. He was now full of vigour and took his leave of
us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

The station-master’s son, a child of two years, had an attack of
typhoid. This gentleman too knew about my curative methods, and
sought my advice. On the first day I gave the child no food at all,
and from the second day onwards only half a banana well mashed with a
spoonful of olive oil and a few drops of sweet orange juice. At night
I applied a cold mud poultice to the child’s abdomen, and in this
case too my treatment was successful. It is possible that the
doctor’s diagnosis was wrong and it was not a case of typhoid.</p>

I made many such experiments on the Farm, and I do not remember to
have failed in even a single case. But today I would not venture to
employ the same treatment. I would now shudder to have to give a
banana and olive oil in a case of typhoid. In 1918 I had an attack of
dysentery myself and I failed to cure it. And I cannot say to this
very day, whether it is due to mywant of self-confidence or to the
difference in climate that the same treatment which was effective in
South Africa is not equally successful in India. But this I know that
the home treatment of diseases and the simplicity of our  life  on
Tolstoy Farm were responsible for a saving of at least two to three
lakhs of public money. The settlers learned to look upon one another
as members of the same family. The satyagrahis secured a pure place
of refuge, little scope was left for dishonesty or hypocrisy and the
wheat was separated from the tares. The dietetic experiments thus far
detailed were made from a hygienic standpoint, but I conducted a most
important experiment upon myself which was purely spiritual in its
nature.</p>

I had pondered deeply and read widely over the question whether as
vegetarians we had any right to take milk. But when I was living on
the Farm, some book or newspaper fell into my hands, in which I read
about the inhuman treatment accorded to cows in  Calcutta in order to
extract the last drop of milk from them, and came across a
description of the cruel and terrible process of <i>phuka</i>. I was</p>

once discussing with Mr. Kallenbach the necessity for taking milk,
and in course of the discussion, I told him about this horrible
practice, pointed out several other spiritual advantages flowing from
the rejection of milk, and observed that it was desirable to give up
milk if it was possible. Mr. Kallenbach with his usual spirit of a
knight-errant was ready at once to launch upon the experiment of
doing without milk, as he highly approved of my observations. The
same day both he and I gave up milk,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and in the end we came to restrict ourselves to  a diet
of fresh and dried fruit, having eschewed all cooked food as well. I
may not here go into the later history of this experiment or tell how
it ended, but I may say this, that during five years of a purely
fruitarian life I never felt weak, nor did I suffer from any disease.
Again during the same period I possessed the fullest capacity for
bodily labour, so much so that one day I walked 55 miles on foot, and
40 miles was an ordinary day’s journey for me. I am firmly  of
opinion that this experiment yielded excellent spiritual results. It
has always been a matter of regret for me that I was compelled
somewhat to modify my fruitarian diet, and if I were free from my
political preoccupations, even at this age of my life and at a risk
to my body I would revert to it today further to explore its
spiritual possibilities. The lack of spiritual insight in doctors and
<i>vaidyas </i>has also been an obstacle in my path.But I must now
close this chapter of pleasant and important reminiscences. Such
dangerous experiments could  have their place only in a struggle of
which self-purification was the very essence. Tolstoy Farm proved to
be a centre of spiritual purification and penance for the final
campaign. I have serious doubts as  to whether the struggle could
have been prosecuted for eight years, whether we could have secured
larger funds, and whether the thousands of men who participated in
the last phase of the struggle would have borne their share in it, if
there had been no Tolstoy Farm. Tolstoy Farm was never placed in the
limelight, yet an institution which deserved it attracted public
sympathy to itself. The Indians saw that the Tolstoy Farmers were
doing what they themselves were not prepared to do and what they
looked upon in the light of hardship. This public confidence was a
great asset to the movement when it was organized afresh on a large
scale in 1913. One can never tell whether such assets give an account
of themselves, and if yes, when. But I do not entertain, and would
ask the reader not to entertain, a shadow of a</p>

for them. They did not know, nor did they care, when the struggle
would end. They were only under one pledge, namely, to refuse
submission to the Black Act and to suffer whatever hardships were
involved in such disobedience. For a fighter the fight itself is
victory for he takes delight in it alone. And as it rests with him to
prosecute the fight, he believes that victory or defeat, pleasure or
pain, depends upon himself. There is no such word in his dictionary
as pain or defeat. In the words of the <i>Gita </i>pleasure and pain,
victory and defeat are the same to him.</p>

Stray satyagrahis now and then went to jail. But when there was no
occasion for going to jail, anyone who observed the external
activities of the Farm could hardly believe that satyagrahis
wereliving there or that they were preparing for a struggle. When a
sceptic happened to visit the Farm, if a friend he would pity us, and
if a critic he would censure us. ‘These fellows,’ he would
remark, ‘have grown lazy  and  are  therefore  eating  the  bread 
of  idleness  in   this secluded spot. They are sick of going to jail
and are therefore enjoying themselves in this fruit garden away from
thedin and roar of cities.’ How could it be explained to this
critic that a satyagrahi cannot go to jail by violating the moral
law, that his very peacefulness and self-restraint constitute his
preparation for ‘war’, and that the satyagrahi, bestowing no
thought on human help, relies upon God as his sole refuge? Finally
there happened, or God brought to  pass,  events which no one had
expected. Help also arrived  which  was equally unforeseen. The
ordeal came all unexpected and in the end there was achieved a
tangible victory which he who ran could read.</p>

</font></sup>He conferred with the Secretary of State for India and
informed him of his intention to proceed to South Africa and acquaint
himself with the facts of the case at first hand. The minister
approved of Gokhale’s mission. Gokhale wrote to me asking me to
arrange a programme for a six weeks’ tour and indicating the latest
date when he must leave South Africa. We were simply overjoyed. No
Indian leader had been to South Africa before or for that matter to
any other place outside India where Indians had emigrated, with a
view to  examining  their condition. We therefore realized the
importance of the visit of a great leader like Gokhale and determined
to accord him a reception which even princes might envy and to take
him to the principal cities of South Africa. Satyagrahis and other
Indians alike cheerfully set about making grand preparations of
welcome. Europeans were also invited to join and did generally
jointhe reception. We also resolved that public meetings should be
held in Town Halls wherever possible and the Mayor of the place
should generally occupy the chair if he consented to do so. We
undertook to decorate the principal stations on the railway line and
succeeded in securing the necessary permission in most cases. Such
permission is not usually granted. But our grand preparations
impressed the authorities, who evinced as  much  sympathy in the
matter as they could. For instance, in Johannesburg alone the
decorations at Park Station took us about a fortnight, including as
they did a large ornamental arch of welcome designed by Mr.
Kallenbach.</p>

But who would think of booking his passage or reserving a good cabin
for him? Gokhale had such delicate health that he needed a
comfortable cabin where he could enjoy some  privacy.  The
authorities of the Steamship Company roundly stated that there was no
such cabin!<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>I
do not quite remember whether it was Gokhale or some friend of his
who informed the India Office about this. A letter was addressed from
the India Office to the directors of the Company and the best cabin
was placed at Gokhale’s disposal while none was available before!
Good came out of this initial evil. The captain of the steamer
received instructions to treat Gokhale well, and consequently he had
a happy and peaceful voyage to South Africa. Gokhale was as jolly and
humorous as he was serious. He participated in the various games and
amusements on the steamer, and thus became very popular among his
fellow passengers. The Union Government  offered Gokhale their
hospitality during his stay at Pretoria and placed the State railway
saloon at his disposal. He consulted me on the point and then
accepted the offer.</p>

Gokhale landed at Cape Town on October 22, 1912. His health was very
much more delicate than I had expected. Herestricted  himself to a
particular diet, and he could not endure much fatigue. The programme
I had framed was much too heavy for him, and I therefore cut it down
as far as possible. Gokhale was ready to go through the whole
programme as it originally stood if no modification was possible. I
deeply repentedof my folly in drawing up an onerous programme without
consulting him. Some changes were made, but much had to be left as it
was. I had not grasped the necessity of securing absolute privacy for
Gokhale, and I had the greatest difficulty in securing it. Still I
must in all humility state in the interests of truth that as I was
fond of and proficient in waiting upon the sick and the elderly, I
revised all the arrangements as soon as I had realized my folly so as
to be able to give Gokhale great privacy and peace. I acted as his
secretary throughout the tour. The volunteers, one of whom was Mr.

I have already written about the Schreiners. I requested Senator W.
P. Schreiner, the head of that illustrious family, to take the chair
on the occasion and he was good enough to consent.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>There was a  big meeting attended by a large number of
Indians and Europeans. Mr. Schreiner welcomed Gokhale in well-chosen
words and expressed his sympathy with the Indians of South Africa.
Gokhale made a speech, concise, full of sound judgment, firm but
courteous, which pleased the Indians and fascinated the Europeans. In
fact Gokhale won the hearts of the variegated people of South Africa
on the very day that he set foot on South African soil.</p>

From Cape Town Gokhale was to go to Johannesburg by a railway journey
of two days. The Transvaal was the field of battle. As we went from
Cape Town, the first large frontier station of the Transvaal was
Klerksdorp. As each of these places had a considerable population of
Indians, Gokhale had to stop and attend a meeting at Klerksdorp, as
well as at the intermediate stations of Potchefstroom and
Krugersdorp, between Klerksdorp and Johanneburg. He therefore left
Klerksdorp by a special train. The Mayors  of  these  places presided
at the meetings, and at none of the stations did the train halt
longer than one or two hours. The train reached Johannesburg
punctually to the minute.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>On the platform there was a dais specially erected for
the occasion and covered with rich carpets. Along with other
Europeans there was present Mr. Ellis, the Mayor of Johannesburg, who
placedhis car at Gokhale’s disposal during his stay in the Golden
City. An address was presented to Gokhale on the station itself.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3

everywhere. The Johannesburg address was engraved on a solid

Gokhale was put up in a fine house belonging to Mr. Kallenbach,
perched on a hill-top five miles from Johannesburg. Gokhale liked the
place immensely as the scenery there was pleasant, the atmosphere
soothing, and the house, though simple, was full of art. A special
office was hired in the city for Gokhale to receive all visitors,
where there were three rooms, a private chamber for Gokhale, a
drawing room, and a waiting room for visitors. Gokhale was taken to
make private calls upon some of the distinguished men in the city. A
private meeting of leading Europeans was organized so as to give
Gokhale a thorough understanding of their standpoint. Besides this a
banquet was held in Gokhale’s honour to which were invited 400
persons including about 150 Europeans.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Indians were admittedby tickets, costing a guinea each,
an arrangement which enabledus to meet the expenses of the banquet.
The menu was purely vegetarian and there were no wines. The cooking
was attended to by volunteers. It is difficult to give an adequate
idea of this here. Hindus and Mussalmans in South Africa do not
observe restrictions as to interdining. But the vegetarians do not
take meat. Some of the Indians were Christians, with whom I was as
intimate as with the rest. These Christians are mostly the
descendants of indenturedlabourers  and many of them make their
living by serving in hotels as waiters. It was with the assistance of
these latter that culinary arrangements could be made on such a large
scale with about 15 Items on the bill of fare. It was a novel and
wonderful experience for the Europeans Of South Africa to fit at
dinner with so many Indians at the same table, to have a</p>

To this gathering Gokhale addressed his longest and most important
speech in South Africa. In preparing this speech he subjected us to a
very full examination. He declared that it had been his lifelong
practice not to disregard the standpoint of local men and even to try
to meet it as far as it was in his power, and therefore he asked me
what I would like him to say from my own point of view. I was to put
this on paper and undertake not to be offended even if he did not
utilize a single word or idea from my draft, which should be neither
too short nor too long, and yet which should not omit a single point
of any consequence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>I
may say at once that Gokhale did not make any use of my language at
all. Indeed, I would never expect such a master of English language
as Gokhale was to take up my phraseology. I cannot even say that
Gokhale adopted my ideas. But as he acknowledged the importance of my
views, I took it for granted that he must have somehow incorporated
my ideas into his utterances. Indeed Gokhale’s train of thought was
such that one could never tell whether or not any room had there been
allowed for one’s own ideas.  I listened to every speech made by
Gokhale, but I do not remember a single occasion when I could have
wished that he had not expressed a certain idea or had omitted a
certain adjective. The clearness, firmness and urbanity of Gokhale’s
utterances flowed from his indefatigable labour and unswerving
devotion to truth.</p>

In Johannesburg we also had to hold a mass meeting of Indians only. I
have always insisted on speaking either in the mother tongue or else
in Hindustani, the lingua franca of India, and thanks to this
insistence I have had much facility in establishingclose relations
with the Indians in South Africa. I was therefore anxious that
Gokhale too should speak to the Indians in Hindustani. I was aware of
Gokhale’s views on the subject. Broken Hindi would not do for him,
and therefore he would speak either in Marathi or in English.  It
seemed artificial to him to speak in Marathi in South Africa and even</p>

if he did speak in Marathi, his speech would have to be translated
into Hindustani for the benefit of Gujarati and North Indian members
of the audience. And that being so, where was the harm if he spoke in
English? Fortunately for me, I had one argument which Gokhale would
accept as conclusive in favour of his making a Marathi speech. There
were many Konkani Mussalmans as well as a few Maharashtra Hindus in
Johannesburg, all of whom were eager to hear Gokhale speak in
Marathi, and who had asked me to request Gokhale to speak in their
mother tongue. I told Gokhale that these friends would be highly
pleased if he spoke in Marathi and I would  translate  his Marathi
into Hindustani. Gokhale burst into laughter and said, “I have
quite fathomed your knowledge of Hindustani, an accompli- shment upon
which you cannot exactly be congratulated. But now you propose to
translate Marathi into Hindustani. May I know where you acquired such
profound knowledge of Marathi?”  I  replied, “What is true of my
Hindustani is equally true of my Marathi. I cannot speak a single
word of Marathi, but I am confident of gathering the purport of your
Marathi speech on a subject with which  I am familiar. In any case,
you will see that I do not misinterpret you to the people. There are
others well versed in Marathi, who could act as your interpreters.
But you will not perhaps approve of such arrangement. So please bear
with me and do speak in Marathi. I too am desirous of hearing your
Marathi speech in common with the Konkani friends.” “You will
always have your own way,” said Gokhale. “And there is no help
for me as I am here at your mercy.” So saying Gokhale fell in with
my suggestion, and from this point onwards right up to Zanzibar he
always spoke in Marathi at similar meetings and I served as
translator by special appointment to him. I do not know if I was able
to bring Gokhale round to the view, that rather than speak in perfect
idiomatic English it was more desirable to speak as far as may be in
the mother tongue and even in broken ungrammatical Hindi. But I do
know that if only to please me he spoke in Marathi in South Africa.
After he had made some speeches, I could see that he too was
gratified by the results of the experiment. Gokhale by his conduct on
many occasions in South Africa showed that there was merit in
pleasing one’s followers in cases not involving</p>

After Johannesburg Gokhale visited Natal<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
 </font></sup>and then proceeded to Pretoria, where he was put up by
the Union Government at the Transvaal Hotel. Here he was to meet the
ministers of the Government, including General Botha and General
Smuts. It was my usual practice to inform Gokhale of all engagements
fixed for the day, early in the morning or on the previous evening if
he so desired. The coming interview with the Union ministers was a
most important affair. We came to the conclusion that I should not go
with Gokhale, nor indeed even offer to go. My presence would raise a
sort of barrier between Gokhale and the ministers, who would be
handicapped in speaking out without any reserve about what they
considered to be the mistakes of the local Indians including my own.
Then again they could not with an easy mind make any statement of
future policy if they wished to make it. As for all these reasons
Gokhale must go alone, it added largely to his burden of
responsibility. What was to be done if Gokhale inadvertently
committed some mistake of fact, or if he had nothing to say as
regards some fact which had not been first brought to his notice, but
which was first put to him by the ministers, or if he was called upon
to accept some arrangement on behalf of the Indians in the absence of
anyone of their responsible leaders? But Gokhale resolved this
difficulty at once. He asked me to prepare a summary historical
statement of the condition of the Indians up to date, and also to put
down in writing how far they were prepared to go.  And  Gokhale said
that he would admit his ignorance if anything outside this ‘brief’
cropped up at the interview, and ceased to worry. It now only
remained for me to prepare the statement and for him to read it.
However it was impossible for me to narrate the vicissitudes of the
Indians’ history in four Colonies ranging over a period of 18 years
except bywriting ten or twenty pages at the least, and there was
hardly any time left for Gokhale to look over it. Again there would
be many questions he would like to put us after reading the paper.
But Gokhale had an infinite capacity for taking pains as he had an
exceptionally sharp memory. He kept himself and others<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

Gokhale’s interview<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>with
the ministers lasted for about two hours, and when he returned, he
said, “You must return to India in a year. Everything has been
settled. The Black Act will be repealed. The racial bar will be
removed from the emigration law. The £53 tax will be abolished.”
“I doubt it very much,” I replied. “You do not know the
ministers as I do. Being an optimist myself, I love your optimism,
but having suffered frequent disappointments, I am not as hopeful in
the matter as you are. But I have no fears either. It is enough for
me that you have obtained this undertaking from the ministers. It is
my duty to fight it out only where it is necessary and to demonstrate
that ours is a righteous struggle. The promise given to you will
serve as a proof of the justice of our demands and will redouble our
fighting spirit if it comes to fighting after all. But I do not think
I can return to India in a year and before many more Indians have
gone to jail.”</p>

General Botha promised me that the Black Act would be repealed and
the £3 tax abolished. You must return to India within twelve months,

During his visit to Natal, Gokhale came in contact with many
Europeans in Durban, Maritzburg and other places. He also saw the
diamond mines in Kimberley, where as well as at Durban public dinners
were arranged<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">4 </font></sup>by
the reception committees, and attended by many Europeans. Thus having
achieved a conquest of Indian as well as European hearts, Gokhale
left South Africa on November 17, 1912. At his wish Mr. Kallenbach
and I accompanied him as far as Zanzibar. On the steamer we had
arranged to have suitable food for him. On his way back to India he
was given an ovation at  Delagoa  Bay, Inhambane, Zanzibar and other
ports.</p>

On the steamer our talks were confined to India or to the duty we
owed to the motherland. Every word of Gokhale glowed with his tender
feeling, truthfulness and patriotism. I observed that even in the
games which he played on board the steamer Gokhale had a patriotic
motive rather than the mere desire to amuse himself, and excellence
was his aim there too.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
On the steamer we had ample time to talk to our heart’s content. In
these conversations Gokhale prepared me for India. He analysed for me
the characters of all the leaders in India and his analysis was so
accurate that I have hardly perceived any difference  between
Gokhale’s estimate and my own personal experience of them.</p>

There are many sacred reminiscences of mine relating to Gokhale’s
tour in South Africa which could be set down here. But I must
reluctantly check my pen as they are not relevant to a history of
satyagraha. The parting at Zanzibar was deeply painful to Kallenbach
and me, but remembering that the most intimate relations of mortal
men must come to an end at last, we somehow reconciled ourselves, and
hoped that Gokhale’s prophecy would come true and both of us would
be able to go to India in a year’s time. But that was not to be.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
However, Gokhale’s visit to South Africa stiffened our resolution,
and the implications and the importance of his tour were better
understood when the struggle was renewed in an active form. If
Gokhale had not come over to South Africa, if he had not seen the
Union ministers, the abolition of the £3 tax could not have been
made  a plank in our platform.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
If the satyagraha struggle had closed with the repeal of the  Black
Act, a fresh fight would have been necessary against the £3 tax, and
not only would the Indians have come in for endless trouble, but it
was doubtful whether they would have been ready so soon for a new and
arduous campaign. It was incumbent upon the free Indians to have the
tax abolished. All constitutional remedies to that end had been
applied but in vain. The tax was being paid ever since 1895. But when
a wrong, no matter how flagrant, has continued for  a  long period of
time, people get habituated to it, and it becomes difficult to rouse
them to a sense of their duty to resist it, and no less difficult to
convince the world that it is a wrong at all. The undertaking given
to Gokhale cleared the way for the satyagrahis. The Government must
repeal the tax in terms of their promise, and if they did not, their
breach of pledge would be a most cogent reason for continuing the</p>

struggle. And this was exactly what happened. Not only did the
Government not abolish the tax within a year, but they declared in so
many words that it could not be removed at all.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 101%">
Gokhale’s tour thus not only helped us to make the  £3  tax  one
of the targets of our satyagraha, but it led to his being recognized
as a special authority on the South African question. His views on
South Africa now carried greater weight, thanks to hispersonal
knowledge of the Indians in South Africa, and he understood himself
and could explain to India what steps the mother country ought to
adopt. When the struggle was resumed, India rendered munificent  help
to the satyagraha funds and Lord Hardinge heartened the satyagrahis
by expressing his ‘deep and burning’ sympathy for them (December
1913).<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>Messrs

In prosecuting the satyagraha struggle the Indians were very careful
not to take a single step not warranted by their principles, and they
always remembered that they should not take any illegitimate
advantage over the Government. For instance, as the Black Act was
restricted in its application to Indians in the Transvaal, only the
Transvaal Indians were admitted as recruits in the struggle. Not only
was there no attempt made to obtain recruits from Natal, the Cape
Colony, etc., but offers from outside the Transvaal were politely
refused. The struggle also was limited to a repeal of the Act in
question. This limitation was understood neither by the Europeans nor
by the Indians. In the early stages the Indians were every now and
then asking for other grievances besides the Black Act to be covered
by the struggle. I patiently explained to them that such extension
would be a violation of the truth which could not be so much as
thought of in a movement professing to abide by truth and truth</p>

alone. In a pure fight the fighters would never go  beyond  the 
objective fixed when the fight began even if they received  an
accession to their strength in course of the fighting, and on the
other hand they could not give up their objective if they  found 
their  strength dwindling away. This twofold principle was fully
observed in South Africa. The strength of the community, upon which
we counted in determining our goal at the commencement of the
struggle, did not answer our expectations as we have already seen,
and yet the handful of satyagrahis who remained stuck to their posts.
Fighting thus single-handed in the face of oddswas comparatively
easy, but it was more difficult, and called for the exercise of
greater self-restraint, riot to enlarge one’s objective when one
had  received  large reinforcements. Such temptations often faced us
in South Africa, but I can emphatically declare that we did not
succumb to them in any single case. And therefore I have often said
that a satyagrahi has a single objective from which he cannot recede
and beyond which he cannot advance, which can in fact be neither
augmented nor abridged. The world learns to apply to a man the
standards which he applies to himself. When the Government saw that
the satyagrahis claimed to follow these fine principles, they began
to judge the conduct of the satyagrahis in the light of those
principles, although they themselves were apparently not bound by any
principle whatever, and several times charged the satyagrahis with a
violation of their principles. Even a child can see that if fresh
anti-Indian legislation was enacted after the Black Act, it must be
included in the satyagraha programme. And yet when fresh restrictions
were imposed on Indian immigration and necessitated an extension of
our programme, the Government levelled against us the totally
undeserved charge of raising fresh issues. If new restraints were
placed on Indian newcomers, we must have the right to recruit them
for the movement, and hence Sorabji and others entered the Transvaal,
as we have already seen. Government could not tolerate this at all,
but I had no difficulty in persuading impartial people about the
propriety of the step. Another such occasion arose after Gokhale’s
departure. Gokhale supposed that the £3 tax would be taken off in a
year<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>and the
necessary legislation would be introduced in the next ensuing session
of the Union Parliament. Instead of this,  General Smuts from his
seat in the House of Assembly said that as the</p>

Europeans in Natal objected to the repeal of the tax, the Union
Government were unable to pass legislation directing its removal,
which however was not the case. The members from Natal by themselves
could do nothing in a body upon which the four Colonies were
represented. Again, General Smuts ought to have  brought forward the
necessary Bill in the Assembly on behalf of the Cabinet and then left
the measure to its fate. But he did nothing of the kind, and provided
us with the welcome opportunity of including the despicable impost as
a cause of ‘war’. There were two reasons for this. First, if in
course of the struggle the Government made a promise and then went
back upon it, the programme would naturally be extended so as to
embrace such repudiation as well, and second, the breach of promise,
made to such a representative of India as Gokhale was, was not only a
personal insult to him but also to the whole of India, and as such
could not be taken lying down. If there had been only one reason,
namely, the first by itself, the satyagrahis, in case they felt
themselves unequal to the task, could have been excused if they did
not offer satyagraha against the £3 tax. But it was impossible to
pocket an insult offered to the mother country, and therefore we felt
the satyagrahis were bound to include the £3 tax in their programme,
and when this tax thus fell within the scope of the struggle, the
indentured Indians had an opportunity of participating in it. The
reader must note that thus far this class had been kept out of the
fray. This new orientation of our policy increased our burden of
responsibility on the one hand, and on the other opened up a fresh
field of recruitment for our ‘army’.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus far, satyagraha had not been so much as mentioned among the
indentured labourers; still less had they been educated to take part
in it. Being illiterate, they could not read <i>Indian Opinion </i>or
other newspapers. Yet I found that these poor folk were keen
observers of the struggle and understood the movement, while some of
them regretted their inability to join it. But when the Union
ministers broke their pledged word, and repeal of the £3 tax was
also included in our programme, I was not at all aware as to which of
them would participate in the struggle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
I wrote to Gokhale about the breach of pledge, and he was deeply
pained to hear of it. I asked him not to be anxious and assured him
that we would fight unto death and wring a repeal of the tax out of
the unwilling hands of the Transvaal Government. The idea,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
however, of my returning to India in a year had to be abandoned, and
it was impossible to say when I would be able to go.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Gokhale was nothing if not a man of figures. He asked me
to let him know the maximum and the minimum strength of our army of
peace, along with the names of the fighters. As far as I can now
remember, I sent 65 or 66 names as the highest and 16 as the lowest
number, and also informed Gokhale that I would not expect monetary
assistance from India for such small numbers. I besought him to have
no fears and not to put an undue strain upon his physical resources.
I had learnt from newspapers and otherwise that after  Gokhale 
returned  to Bombay from South Africa, charges of weakness, etc., had
been laid at his door. I therefore wished that Gokhale should not try
to raise any funds for us in India.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>But this was his stern answer: “We in India have some
idea of our duty even as you understand your obligations in South
Africa. We will not permit you to tell us what is or is not proper
for us to do. I only desired to know the position in South Africa,
but did not seek your advice as to what we may do.” I grasped
Gokhale’s meaning, and never afterwards said or wrote a word on the
subject. In the same letter he gave me consolation and caution. He
was afraid in view of the breach of pledge that it would be a long
protracted  struggle, and he doubted how long a handful of men could
continue to give battle to the insolent brute force of the Union
Government. In South Africa we set about making our preparations.
There could be no sitting at ease in the ensuing campaign. It was
realized that we would be imprisoned for long terms. It was decided
to close down Tolstoy Farm. Some families returned to their homes
upon the release of the bread-winners. The rest mostly belonged to
Phoenix, which therefore was pitched upon as the future base of
operations for the satyagrahis. Another reason for preferring Phoenix
was that, if the indentured labourers joined the struggle against the
£3 tax, it would be more convenient to meet them from a place in
Natal.</p>

While preparations were still being made for resuming the struggle, a
fresh grievance came into being, which afforded an opportunity even
to women to do their bit in the struggle. Some brave women had
already offered to participate, and when satyagrahis went to jail for
hawking without a licence, their wives had expressed a desire to
follow suit. But we did not then think it proper to send women to</p>

sending them into the firing line, and I for my part could not summon
courage enough to take them to the front. Another argument was, that
it would be derogatory to our manhood if we sacrificed our women in
resisting a law which was directed only against men. But an event now
happened, which involved a special affront to women, and which
therefore left no doubt in our minds as to the propriety of
sacrificing them.</p>

As if, unseen by anyone, God was preparing the ingredients for the
Indians’ victory and demonstrating still more clearly the injustice
of the Europeans in South Africa, an event happened which none had
expected. Many married men came to South Africa from India, while
some Indians contracted marriages in South Africa itself. There is no
law for the registration of ordinary marriages in India, and the
religious ceremony suffices to confer validity upon them. The same
custom ought to apply to Indians in South Africa as well and although
Indians had settled in South Africa for the last forty years, the
validity of marriages solemnized according to the rites of the
various religions of India had never been called in question. But at
this time there was a case in which Mr. Justice Searle of the Cape
Supreme Court gave judgment on March 14, 1913, to the effect that all
marriages were outside the pale of legal marriages in South Africa
with the exception of such as were celebrated according to Christian
rites and registered by the Registrar of Marriages.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>This terrible judgment thus nullified in South Africa at
a stroke of the pen all marriages celebrated according to the Hindu,
Mussalman and Zoroastrian rites. The many married Indian women in
South Africa in terms of this judgment ceased to rank as the wives of
their husbands and were degraded to the rank of concubines, while
their progeny were deprived of their right to inherit the parents’
property. This was an insufferable situation for women no less than
men, and the Indians in South Africa were deeply agitated.</p>

According to my usual practice I wrote to the Government, asking them
whether they agreed to the Searle judgment and whether, if the judge
was right in interpreting it, they would amend the law so as to
recognize the validity of Indian marriages consecrated according to
the religious customs of the parties and recognized as legal  in
India. The Government were not then in a mood to listen and could not

The Satyagraha Association held a meeting to consider whether they
should appeal against the Searle judgment, and came to the conclusion
that no appeal was possible on a question of this nature. If there
was to be an appeal, it must be preferred by Government, or if they
so desired, by the Indians provided that the Government openly sided
with them through their Attorney-General. To appeal when these
conditions were not satisfied would be in a way tantamount to
tolerating the invalidation of Indian marriages. Satyagraha would
have to be resorted to even if such an appeal was made and if it was
rejected. In these circumstances therefore it seemed best not to
prefer any appeal against this unspeakable insult.</p>

A crisis now arrived when there could not be any waiting for an
auspicious day or hour. Patience was impossible in the face of this
insult offered to our womanhood. We decided to offer stubborn
satyagraha irrespective of the number of fighters. Not only could the
women now be not prevented from joining the struggle,  but we decided
even to invite them to come into line along with the men. We first
invited the sisters who had lived<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>on Tolstoy Farm. I found that they were only too glad to
enter the struggle. I gave them an idea of the risks incidental to
such participation I explained to them that they would have to put up
with restraints in the matter of food, dress, and personal movements.

It is easy to get into prison by committing a crime but it is
difficult to get in by being innocent. As the criminal seeks to
escape arrest the police pursue and arrest him. But they lay their
hands upon the innocent man who courts arrest of his own free will
only when they cannot help it. The first attempts of these sister
were not crowned with success. They entered the Transvaal at
Vereeniging without permits but they were not arrested.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

police ignored them. It now became a problem with the women how they
should get arrested. There were not many men ready to go to jail and
those who were ready could not easily have their wish.</p>

We  now  decided  to  take  a   step   which   we   had   reserved
till the last and which in the event fully answered our expectations.
I had contemplated sacrificing all the settlers in Phoenix at
acritical period. That was to be my final offering to the God of
Truth. The settlers at Phoenix were mostly my close co-workers and
relations. The idea was to send all of them to jail with the
exception of a few who would be required for the conduct of <i>Indian
Opinion </i>and of children below sixteen. This was the maximum of
sacrifice open to me in the circumstances. The sixteen stalwarts to
whom I had referred in writing to Gokhale were among the pioneers of
the Phoenix settlement. It was proposed that these friends should
cross over into the Transvaal and, as they crossed over, get arrested
for entering the country without permits. We were afraid that
Government would not arrest them if we made a previous announcement
of our intention, and therefore we guarded it as a secret except from
a couple of friends. When the pioneers entered the Transvaal, the
police officer would ask them their names and addresses, and it was
part of the programme not to supply this information as there was an
apprehension that if their identity was disclosed, the police would
come to know that they were my relations and therefore would not
arrest them. Refusal to give name and address to an officer was also
held to be a separate offence. While the Phoenix group entered the
Transvaal, the sisters who had courted arrest in the Transvaal in
vain were to enter Natal. As it was an</p>

offence to enter the Transvaal from Natal without a permit, it was
equally an offence to enter Natal from the Transvaal. If the sisters
were arrested upon entering Natal, well and good. But if they were
not arrested, it was arranged that they should proceed to and post
themselves at Newcastle, the great coal-mining centre in Natal, and
advise the indentured Indian labourers there to go on strike. The
mother tongue of the sisters was Tamil, and they could speak a little
Hindustani besides. The majority of labourers on the coalmines hailed
from Madras State and spoke Tamil or Telugu, though there were many
from North India as well. If the labourers struck in response to the
sisters’ appeal, Government was bound to arrest them along with the
labourers, who would thereby probably be fired with still greater
enthusiasm. This was the strategy I thought out and unfolded before
the Transvaal sisters.</p>

I went to Phoenix, and talked to the settlers about my plans First of
all I held a consultation with the sisters living there. I knew that
the step of sending women to jail was fraught with serious risk. Most
of the sisters in Phoenix spoke Gujarati. They had not had the
training or experience of the Transvaal sisters. Moreover, most  of
them were related to me, and might think of going to jail only on
account of my influence with them. If afterwards they flinched at the
time of actual trial or could not stand the jail, they might be led
to apologize, thus not only giving me a deep shock but also causing
serious damage to the movement. I decided not to broach the subject
to my wife as she could not say no to any proposal I made, and if she
said yes, I would not know what value to attach to her assent, and as
I knew that in a serious matter like this the husband should leave
the wife to take what step she liked on her own initiative, and
should not be offended at all even if she did not take any step
whatever. I talked to the other sister who readily fell in with my
proposal and expressed their readiness to go to jail. They assured me
that they would compete their term in jail come what might. My wife
overheard my conversation with the sisters, and addressing me, said,
“I am sorry that you are not telling me about this. What defect is
there in me which disqualifies me for jail? I also wish to take the
path to which you are inviting the others.” “You know I am the
last person to cause you pain,” I replied. There is no question of
my distrusting you. I would be only too glad if you went to jail but
it should not appear at all as if you went at my instance. In matters
like this everyone should act relying solely upon one’s own
strength and courage. If I asked you,</p>

you might be inclined to go just for the sake of complying with my
request. And then if you began to tremble in the law court or were
terrified by hardships in jail I could not find fault with you, but
how would it stand with me? How could I then harbour you or look the
world in the face? It is fears like these which have prevented me
from asking you too to court jail.” You may have nothing to do with
me she said, “if being unable to stand jail I secure my release by
an apology. If you can endure hardships and so can my boys, why 
cannot I? I am bound to join the struggle.” “Then I am bound to
admit you to it,” said I. “You know my conditions and you know my
temperament. Even now reconsider the matter if you like and if after
mature thought you deliberately come to the conclusion not to join
the movement, you are Free to withdraw. And you must understand that
there is nothing to be ashamed of in changing your decision even
now.”</p>

These ‘invaders’ were to go to jail for crossing the border and
entering the Transvaal without permits. The reader who has seen the
list of their names will have observed, that if some of them were
disclosed beforehand, the police might not perhaps arrest the persons
bearing them. Such in fact had been the case with me. I was arrested
twice or thrice but after this the police ceased to meddle with me at
the border. No one was informed of this party having started and the
news was of course withheld from the papers. Moreover the party had
been instructed not to give their names even to the police and to

The police were familiar with cases of this nature. After the Indians
got into the habit of courting arrest, they would often not give
their names just for the fun of the thing, and the police therefore
did not notice anything strange about the behaviour of the Phoenix
party, which was arrested accordingly. They were then tried and
sentenced to three months’ imprisonment with hard labour (September
23, 1913).</p>

These events stirred the heart of the Indians not only in South
Africa but also in the motherland to its very depths. Sir Pherozeshah
had been so far indifferent. In 1901 he had strongly advised me not
to go to South Africa. He held that nothing could be done for Indian
emigrants beyond the seas so long as India had not achieved her own
freedom, and he was little impressed with the satyagraha movement in
its initial stages. But women in jail pleaded with him as nothing
else could. As he himself put it in his Bombay Town Hall speech, his
blood boiled at the thought of these women lying in jails herded with
ordinary criminals and India could not sleep over the matter any
longer.</p>

The women’s bravery was beyond words. They were all kept in
Maritzburg jail, where they were considerably harassed. Their food
was of the worst quality and they were given laundry work as their
task. No food was permitted to be brought from outside till nearly
the end of their term. One sister was under a religious vow to
restrict herself to a particular diet. After great difficulty the
jail authorities allowed her that diet, but the food supplied was
unfit for human consumption. The sister badly needed olive oil. She
did not get it at first, and when she got it, it was old and rancid.
She offered to get it at her own expense but was told that jail was
no hotel, and she must takewhat food was given her. When this sister

It was an absolutely pure sacrifice that was offered by these
sisters, who were innocent of legal technicalities, and many of whom
had no idea of their country, their patriotism being based only upon
faith. Some of them were illiterate and could not read the papers.
But they knew that a mortal blow was being aimed at the Indians’
honour, and their going to jail was a cry of agony and prayer offered
from the-bottom of their heart, was in fact the purest of all
sacrifices. Such heart prayer is always acceptable to God. Sacrifice
is fruitful only to the extent that it is pure. God hungers after
devotion in man. He is glad to accept the widow’s mite offered with
devotion, that is to say, without a selfish motive, and rewards it a
hundred fold. The unsophisticated Sudama offered a handful of rice,
but the small offering put an end to many years’ want and
starvation. The imprisonment of many might have been fruitless but
the devoted sacrifice of a single pure soul could never go in vain.
None can tell whose sacrifice in South Africa was acceptable to God,
and hence bore fruit. But we do know that Valliamma’s sacrifice
bore fruit and so did the sacrifice of the other sisters.</p>

Souls without number spent themselves in the past, are spending
themselves in the present and will spend themselves in the future in
the service of country and humanity, and that is in the fitness of
things as no one knows who is pure. But satyagrahis may rest assured,
that even if there is only one among them who is pure as crystal, his
sacrifice suffices to achieve the end in view. The world rests upon
the bedrock of <i>satya </i>or truth. <i>Asatya </i>meaning untruth

which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of

complaint was justified, the strikers could not hold on in the
circumstances, and I must find a way out of the difficulty, or else
it was very much to be preferred that they should own themselves to
be defeated and return to work at once rather than that they should
resume work after a period of weary waiting. But defeatist counsel
was not in my line. I therefore suggested that the only possible
course was for the labourers to leave their masters’ quarters, to
fare forth in fact like pilgrims.</p>

The labourers were not to be counted by tens but by hundreds. And
their number might easily swell into thousands. How was I to house
and feed this ever-growing multitude? I would not appeal to India for
monetary help. The river of gold which later on flowed from the
motherland had not yet started on its course. Indian traders were
mortally afraid and not at all ready to help me publicly, as they had
trading relations with the coal-owners and other Europeans. Whenever 
I went to Newcastle, I used to stop with them. But this time, as I
would place them in an awkward position, I resolved to put up at
another place.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
As I have already stated, the Transvaal sisters were most of them
Tamilians. They had taken up their quarters in Newcastle with Mr. D.
Lazarus, a middle-class Christian Tamilian, who owned a small plot of
land and a house consisting of two or three rooms. I also decided to
put up with this family, who received me with open arms. The poor
have no fears. My host belonged to a family of indentured labourers,
and hence he or his relations would be liable to pay the £3 tax. No
wonder he and his people would be familiar with the woes of
indentured labourers and would therefore deeply sympathize with them.
It has never been easy for friends to harbour me under their roof,
but to receive me now was tantamount toinviting financial ruin upon
one’s head or perhaps even to facing imprisonment. Very few
well-to-do traders would like to place themselves  in  a  like
predicament. I realized their limitations as well as my own, and
therefore remained at a respectabledistance from them. Poor Lazarus
would sacrificed some wages if it came to that. He would be willingly
cast into prison, but how could he tolerate the wrongs heaped upon
indentured labourers poorer even than himself? Lazarus saw that the
Transvaal sisters who had been his guests went to the indentured
labourers’ succour and suffered imprisonment in the act of doing
so.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
He realized that he owed a debt of duty to the labourers too and
therefore gave me shelter at his place. He not only sheltered me but
he devoted his all to the cause. My stopping there converted his
house into a caravanserai. All sort and conditions of men would come
and go and the premises at all times would present the appearance of
an ocean of heads. The kitchen fire would know no rest day and night.
Mrs. Lazarus would drudge like a slave all day long, and yet her face
as well as her husband’s would always be lit up with a smile as
with perpetual sunshine.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
But Lazarus could not feed hundreds of labourers.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>I suggested to the labourers that they should take it
that their strike was to last for all time and leave the quarter;
provided by their masters. They must sell such of their goods as
could find a purchaser. The rest they must leave in their quarters.
The coal-owners would not touch their belongings, but if with a view
to wreaking further vengeance upon them they threw them away on the
streets, the labourers must take that risk as well. When they came to
me, they should bring nothing with them except their wearing apparel
and blankets. I promised to live and have my meals with them so long
as the strike lasted and so long as they were outside jail. They
could sustain their strike and win a victory if and only if they came
out on these conditions. Those who could not summon courage enough to
take this line of action should return to work. None should despise
or harass those who thus resumed their work. None of the labourers
demurred to my conditions. From the very day that I made this
announcement, there was  a  continuous stream of pilgrims who
‘retired from the household life to the houseless one, along with
their wives and children with bundles of clothes upon their heads.</p>

I had no means of housing them; the sky was the only roof over their
heads. Luckily for us the weather was favourable, there being neither
rain nor cold. I was confident that the trader class would not fail
to feed us. The traders of Newcastle suppliedcooking pots and bags of
rice and dal. Other places also showered rice, dal, vegetables,
condiments and other things upon us. Thecontributions exceeded my
expectations. Not all were ready to go to jail, but all felt for the
cause, and all were willing to bring their quota to the movement to
the best of their ability. Those who could not give anything served

required to look after these obscure and uneducated men, and they
were forthcoming. They rendered priceless help, and many of them were

There was a huge concourse of men, which was continuously receiving
accessions. It was a dangerous if not an impossible task to keep them
in one place and look after them while they had no employment. They
were generally ignorant of the laws of sanitation. Some of them had
been to jail for criminal offences such as murder, theft or adultery.
But I did not consider myself fit to sit in judgment over the
morality of the strikers. It would have been silly for me to attempt
at distinguishing between the goats and the  sheep.  My business was
only to conduct the strike, which could not be mixed up with any
other reforming activity. I was indeed bound to see that the rules of
morality were observed in the camp, but it was not for me to inquire
into the antecedents of each striker. There were bound to be crimes
if such a heterogeneous multitude was pinned down to one place
without any work to do. The wonder was that the few days that we
stopped here like that passed without any incident. All were quiet as
if they had thoroughly grasped the gravity of the situation.</p>

I thought out a solution of my problems. I must  take  this  ‘army’
to the Transvaal and see them safely deposited in jail like the
Phoenix party. The army should be divided into small batches, each of
which should cross the border separately. But I dropped this last
idea as soon as it was formed as it would have taken too long a time
in its execution, and the successive imprisonment of small batches
would not produce the normal effect of a mass movement.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The strength of the ‘army’ was about five thousand. I had not the
money to pay the railway fare for such a large number ofpersons, and
therefore they could not all be taken by rail. And if they were taken
by rail, I would be without the means of putting their morale to the
test. The Transvaal border is 36 miles from Newcastle. The border
villages of Natal and the Transvaal are Charlestown and Volksrust,
respectively. I finally decided to march on foot. I consulted the
labourers who had their wivesand children with them and some of whom
therefore hesitated to agree to my proposal. I had no alternative
except to harden my heart, and declared that those who wished were
free to return to the mines. But none of them would avail themselves</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 101%; page-break-before: always">
of this liberty. We decided that those who were disabled in their
limbs should be sent by rail, and all able-bodied persons announced
their readiness to go to Charlestown on foot. The march was to be
accomplished in two days. In the end everyone was glad that the move
was made. The labourers realized that it would be some relief to poor
Lazarus and his family. The Europeans in Newcastle anticipated an
outbreak of the plague, and were anxious to take all manner of steps
in order to prevent it. By making a move we restored to them their
peace of mind and also saved ourselves from the irksome measures to
which they would have subjected us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

At their invitation I saw the mine-owners in Durban. I observed that
they were somewhat impressed by the strike, but I did not expect
anything big to come out of the conference. The humility of a
satyagrahi however knows no bounds. He does not let slip a single
opportunity for settlement, and he does not mind if anyone therefore
looks upon him as timid. The man who has faith in him and the
strength which flows from faith does not care if he is looked down
upon by others. He relies solely upon his internal strength. He is
therefore courteous to all, and thus cultivates and enlists world
opinion in favour of his own cause.</p>

I returned to Newcastle. Labourers were still pouring in from all
directions. I clearly explained the whole situation to the ‘army’.
I said they were still free to return to work if they wished. I told
them about the threats held out by the coal-owners, and pictured
before them the risks of the future. I pointed out that no one could
tell them when the struggle would end. I described to the men the
hardships of jail, and yet they would not flinch. They fearlessly
replied that they would never be down-hearted so long as I was
fighting by their side, and they asked me not to be anxious about
them as they were inured to hardships.</p>

It was now only left for us to march. The labourers were informed one
evening that they were to commence the march early next morning
(October 28, 1913), and the rules to be observed on the march were
read out to them. It was no joke to control a multitude of five or
six thousand men. I had no idea of the exact number, nor did I know
their names or places of residence. I was merely content with as many
of them as chose to remain. I could not afford to give anything on
the road beyond a daily ration of one pound and a half of bread and
an ounce of sugar to each ‘soldier’. I planned to get something
more from the Indian traders on the way. But if I failed they must
rest content with bread and sugar. My experience of the Boer War and
the Zulu ‘rebellion’ stood me in good stead on the present
occasion. None of the ‘invaders’ was to keep with him any more
clothes than necessary. None was to touch anyone’s property on the
way. They were to bear it patiently if any official or non official
European met them and abused or even flogged them. They were to 
allow themselves to be arrested if the police offered to arrest them.
The march must continue even if I was arrested. All these points were
explained to the men and I also announced the names of those who
should successively lead the ‘army’ in my place.</p>

make our cooking arrangements on the grounds of the mosque. The
ration supplied on the march would be exhausted when camp was reached
and therefore we were in need of cooking pots, which were cheerfully
supplied by the traders. We had with us a plentiful store of rice,
etc., to which also the traders contributed their share.</p>

Charlestown was a small village with a population of hardly 1,000<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

of pilgrims. Only women and children were lodged in houses. All the
rest camped in-the open.</p>

There are many sweet and some bitter reminiscences of our stay in
Charlestown. The pleasant memories are connected with the sanitary
department and the District Health Officer, Dr. Briscoe, who was
rather alarmed at the phenomenal increase in the population, but who,
instead of adopting any stringent measures, met me, made some
suggestions and offered to help me. Europeans are careful and we are
careless about three things, the purity of the water-supply and,
keeping roads and sanitary conveniences clean. Dr. Briscoe asked me
to see that no water was thrown on the roads and to prevent our men
from dirtying the place or throwing away refuse promiscuously. He
further suggested that the men should be confined to the area he
assigned to us and that I should hold myself responsible for keeping
that area clean. I thankfully accepted his suggestions and was then
at perfect ease.</p>

It was very difficult to have our people observe these rules. But the
pilgrims and co-workers lightened my task. It has been my constant
experience that much can be done if the servant actually serves and
does not dictate to the people. If the servant puts in body-labour
himself, others will follow in his wake. And such was my experience
on the present occasion. My co-workers and I never hesitated to do
sweeping, scavenging and similar work, with the result that others
also took it up enthusiastically. In the absence of such sensible
procedure it is no good issuing orders to others. All would assume
leadership and dictate to others and there would be nothing done in
the end. But where the leader himself becomes a servant, there are no
rival claimants for leadership.</p>

The ration consisted of rice and dal. We had a large stock of
vegetable, which could not be cooked separately for want of time and
cooking pots and was therefore mixed with dal. The kitchen was active

the day or night. No labourers were to stopat Newcastle. All knew

As I think of the patience and endurance of the men, I am overpowered
by a sense of the greatness of God. I was the leader among the cooks.
Sometimes there was too much wafer in the dal, at other times it was
insufficiently cooked. The vegetable and even the rice was sometimes
ill cooked. I have not seen many people in the world who would
cheerfully gulp down such food. On the other hand,  I have observed
in the South African jails that even those who pass as well-educated
men lose their temper if they are given food somewhat less than
sufficient or ill cooked, or even if they get it a little late.</p>

Serving the food was, if possible, even more difficult than cooking
it and was in my sole charge. I shouldered the responsibility for the
food being well or ill cooked. Even so it rested with me to satisfy
all present by cutting down the individual ration when there was too
little food and more than the expected number of diners. I can never
forget the angry look which the sisters gave me for a moment when I
gave them too little food and which was at once transformed into a
smile as they understood the thanklessness of my self-chosen task. “I
am helpless, I would say. “The quantity cooked is small, and as I
have to feed many, I must divide it equally between them.” Upon
this they would grasp the situation and go away smiling, saying that
they were content.</p>

with internal squabbles. What was worse, there were cases of
adultery. There was terrible overcrowding andmen and women had to be
kept together. Animal passion bows no shame. As soon as the cases
occurred, I arrived on the scene. The guilty parties were abashed</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
and they were segregated. But who can say how many such cases
occurred which never came to my knowledge? It is no use dwelling any
further upon this topic, which I have brought in in order to show
that everything was not in perfect order and that even when someone
did go wrong there was no exhibition of insolence. On many similar
occasions I have seen how well-behaved people become in a good
atmosphere even when they are originally semi-barbarous and not
over-observant of the dictates of morality, and it is more essential
and profitable to realize this truth.</p>

We have now arrived at the beginning of November 1913. But before we
proceed, it will be well to take note of two events. Bai Fatma Mehtab
of Durban could no longer be at peace when the Tamilian sisters
received sentences of imprisonment in Newcastle She therefore left
for Volksrust to court arrest along with her mother Hanifabai and
seven-year-old son. Mother and daughter were arrested but the
Government declined to arrest the boy. Fatma Bai was called upon to
give her finger impressions at the charge office but she fearlessly
refused to submit to the indignity. Eventually she and her mother
were sent to prison for three months (October 13, 1913).<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2</font></sup></p>

The labourers’ strike was in full swing at this time. Men as well
as women were on the move between the mining district and
Charlestown<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3</font></sup>.
Of these, there were two women with their little ones one of whom
died of exposure on the march. The other fell from the arms of its
mother while she was crossing a spruit and was drowned. But the brave
mothers refused to be dejected and continued their march. One of them
said, “We must not pine for the dead who will not come back to us
for all our sorrow. It is the living for whom we must work.” I have
often come across instances of such quiet heroism, sterling faith and
saving knowledge among the poor.</p>

The men and women in Charlestown held to their difficult post of duty
in such a stoical spirit. For it was no mission of peace that took us
to that border village. If anyone wanted peace, he had to search for
it within. Outwardly the words ‘there is no peace here’ were</p>

living in their camp, careless<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

I wrote to the Government,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>that we did not propose to enter the Transvaal with a
view to domicile, but as an effective protest against the ministers’
breach of pledge and as a pure demonstration of our distress at the
loss of our self-respect. Government would be relieving us of all
anxiety if they were good enough to arrest us where we then were,
that is in Charlestown. But if they did not arrest us, and if any of
us surreptitiously entered the Transvaal, the responsibility would
not be ours. There was no secrecy about our movement. None of us had
a personal axe to grind. We would not like it if any of us secretly
entered the Transvaal. But we could not hold ourselves responsible
for the acts of any as we had to deal with thousands of unknown men
and as we could not command any other sanction but that of love.
Finally  I assured the Government that if they repealed the £3 tax,
the strike would be called off and the indentured labourers would
return to work, as we would not ask them to join the general struggle
directed against the rest of our grievances.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%">
The position therefore was quite uncertain, and there was no knowing
when the Government would arrest us. But at a crisis like this we
could not await the reply of the Government for a number of days, but
only for one or two returns of the post. We therefore decided to
leave Charlestown and enter the Transvaal at once if the Government
did not put us under arrest. If we were not arrested on the way, the
‘army of peace’ was to march twenty to twenty-four miles a day
for eight days together, so as to reach Tolstoy Farm, and to stop
there till the struggle was over and in the meanwhile to maintain
themselves by working on the Farm. Mr. Kallenbach had made all the
necessary arrangements. The idea was to construct mud huts with the
help of the pilgrims themselves. So long as the huts were under
construction, the</p>

able-bodied camping in the open. The only difficulty was that the
rains were now about to set in, and everyone must have a shelter over

We also made other preparations for the march. The good Dr. Briscoe
improvised a small medical chest for us,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and gaveus some instruments which even a layman like
myself could handle. The chest was to be carried by hand as there was
to be noconveyance with the pilgrims. We therefore carried with us
theleast possible quantity of medicines, which would not enable us to
treat even a hundred persons at the same time. But that did not
matter as we proposed to encamp every day near some village, where we
hoped to get the drugs of which we ran short, and as we were not
taking with us any of the patients or disabled persons whom we had
arranged to leave in the villages <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.12cm; line-height: 102%">
Bread and sugar constituted our sole ration, but how was  a supply of
bread to be ensured on the eight days’ march? The bread must be
distributed to the pilgrims every day and we could not hold any of it
in stock. The only solution of this problem was that someone should
supply us with bread at each stage. But who would be our provider?
There were no Indian bakers at all. Again there could not be found a
baker in each of the villages, which usually depended upon the cities
for their supply of bread. The bread therefore must be supplied by
some baker and sent by rail to the appointed station. Volksrust was
about double the size of Charlestown, and a large European bakery
there willingly contracted to supply bread at each place. The baker
did not take advantage of our awkward plight to charge us higher than
the market rates and supplied bread made of excellent flour. He sent
it in time by rail, and the railway officials also Europeans, not
only honestly delivered it to us, but they took good care of it in
transit and gave us some special facilities. They knew that we
harboured no enmity in our hearts, intended no harm to any living
soul and sought redress only through self-suffering. The atmosphere
around us was thus purified and continued to be pure. The feeling of
love which is dormant though present in all mankind was roused into
activity. Everyone realized that we are all brothers whether we are</p>

When all the preparations for the march were completed, I made one
more effort to achieve a settlement. I had already sent letters and
telegrams. I now decided to telephone even at the risk of my
overtures being answered by an insult. From Charlestown I telephoned
General Smuts in Pretoria. I called his secretary and said: “Tell
General Smuts that I am fully prepared for the march. The Europeans
in Volksrust are excited and perhaps likely to violate even the
safety of our lives. They have certainly held out such a threat. I am
sure that even the General would not wish any such untoward event to
happen. If he promises to abolish the £3 tax, I will stop the march,
as I will not break the law merely for the sake of breaking it but I
will if I am driven to it by inexorable necessity. Will not the
General accede to such a small request?” I received this reply
within half a minute: “General Smuts will have nothing to do with
you. You may do just as you please.” With this the message closed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 101%">
I had fully expected this result, though I was not prepared for the
curtness of the reply. I hoped for a civil answer, as my political
relations with the General since the organization of satyagraha had
now subsisted for six years. But as I would not be elated by his
courtesy, I did not weaken in the face of his incivility. The strait
and narrow path I had to tread was clear before me. The next day
(November 6, 1913) at the appointed stroke of the hour (6.30) we
offered prayers and commenced the march in the name of God. The
pilgrim band was composed of 2,037 men, 127 women 57 children.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

The caravan of pilgrims thus started punctually at the appointed
hour. There is a small spruit one mile from Charlestown, and as soon
as one crosses it, one has entered Volksrust or the Transvaal. A
small patrol of mounted policemen was on duty at the border gate. I
went up to them, leaving instructions with the ‘army’ to cross
over when I signalled to them. But while I was still talking with the
police, the pilgrims made a sudden rush and crossed the border. The
police surrounded them, but the surging multitude was not easy to
control.</p>

Two days before this the Europeans of Volksrust had held a meeting
where they offered all manner of threats to the Indians. Some said
that they would shoot the Indians if they entered the Transvaal. Mr.
Kallenbach attended this meeting to reason withthe Europeans who were
however not prepared to listen to himIndeed some of them even stood
up to assault him. Mr. Kallenbach is an athlete, having received
physical training at the hands of Sandow, and it was not easy to
frighten him. One European challenged him to a duel. Mr. Kallenbach
replied, “As I have accepted the religion of peace, I may not
accept the challenge. Let him who will come and do his worst with me.
But I will continue toclaim a hearing at this meeting. You have
publicly invited all Europeans to attend, and I am here to inform you
that not all Europeans are ready as you are to lay violent hands upon
innocent men. There is one European who would like to inform you that
the charges you level at the Indians are false. The Indians do not
want what you imagine them to do. The Indians are not out to
challenge your position as rulers. They do not wish to fight with you
or to fill the country. They only seek justice pure and simple. They
propose to enter the Transvaal not with a view to settling there, but
only as an effective demonstration against the unjust tax which is
levied on them. They are brave men. They will not injure you in
person or in property, they will not fight with you, but enter the
Transvaal they will, even in the face of your gunfire. They are not
the men to beat a retreat from fear of your bullets or your spears.
They propose to melt, and I know they will melt, your hearts by
self-suffering. This is all I have to say. I have had my say and I
believe that I have thus rendered you a service. Beware and save
yourselves from perpetrating a wrong.” With these words Mr.
Kallenbach resumed his seat. The audience was rather abashed. The
pugilist who had invited Mr. Kallenbach to single combat became his
friend.</p>

We had heard about this meeting and were prepared for any mischief by
the Europeans in Volksrust. It was possible that the large number of
policemen massed at the border was intended as a check upon them.
However that may be, our procession passed through the place in
peace. I do not remember that any European attempted even</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">

On the first day we were to stop for the night at Palmford about
eight miles from Volksrust, and we reached the place at about 5 p.m.
The pilgrims took their ration of bread and sugar, and spread
themselves in the open air. Some were talking, while others were
singing <i>bhajans</i>. Some of the women were thoroughly exhausted
by the march. They had dared to carry their children in their arms,
but it was impossible for them to proceed further. I therefore,
according to my previous warning, kept them as lodgers with a good
Indian shopkeeper who promised to send them to Tolstoy Farm if we
were permitted to go there, and to their homes if we were arrested.</p>

retire when I heard a tread. I saw a European coming lantern in hand.

daybreak they must regularly resume the march. The march would
commence before sunrise, and when it was time for them to halt and
get their rations, he must break to them the news of my arrest. He
might inform anyone who inquired about me  in  the  interval. If the
pilgrims were arrested, they must allow themselves to be arrested.
Otherwise they must continue the march according to the programme.
Naidoo had no fears at all. I also told him what was to be done in

I went with the police officer, and we took the train  for  Volksrust
the next morning. I appeared before the Court in Volksrust, but the
Public Prosecutor himself asked for a remand until the 14th as he was
not ready with the evidence. The case was postponed accordingly. I
applied for bail as I had over 2,000 men, 122 women and 50 children
in my charge whom I should like to take on to their destination
within the period of postponement. The Public Prosecutor opposed my
application. But the Magistrate was helpless in the matter, as every
prisoner not charged with a capital offence is in law entitled to be
allowed to give bail for his appearance, and I could not be deprived
of that right. He therefore released me on a bail of £50. Mr.
Kallenbach had a car ready for me, and he took me at once to rejoin
the ‘invaders’. The special reporter of <i>The </i><i>Transvaal
Leader </i>wanted to go with us. We took  him  in  the  car,  and  he
 published  at  the  time a vivid description of the case, the
journey, and the meeting with the pilgrims, who received me with
enthusiasm and were transported with joy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1

We continued the march, but it did not suit the Government to leave
me in a state of freedom. I was therefore rearrested at Standerton on
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>the 8th.
Standerton is comparatively a bigger place. There was something
rather strange about the manner of my arrest here. I was distributing
bread to the pilgrims. The Indian store-keepers at Standerton
presented us with some tins of marmalade, and the distribution
therefore took more time than usual. Meanwhile the Magistrate came
and stood by my side. He waited till the distribution of rations was
over, and then called me aside. I knew the gentleman, who, I thought,
perhaps wanted to talk with me. He laughed and said, “You are my
prisoner.”</p>

Indian traders had kept a carriage ready for me and  I rejoined the
pilgrims again when they had hardly proceeded three miles further.
The pilgrims thought, and I thought too, that we might now perhaps
reach Tolstoy Farm. But that was not to be. It was no small thing
however that the invaders got accustomed to my being arrested. The
five co-workers remained in jail.</p>

We were now near Johannesburg. The reader will remember that the
whole pilgrimage had been divided into eight stages. Thus far we had
accomplished our marches exactly according to programmeand we now had
four days’ march in front of us. But our spirits rose from day to
day, Government too got more and more anxious as to how they should
deal with the Indian invasion. They would be charged with weakness
and want of tact if they arrested us after we had reached our
destination. If we were to be arrested, we must be arrested before we
reached the promised land.</p>

Government saw that my arrest did not dishearten or frighten the
pilgrims, nor did it lead them to break the peace. If they took to
rioting, Government would have an excellent opportunity  of
convicting them into food for gunpowder. Our firmness was very
distressing to General Smuts, coupled as it was with peacefulness,
and he even said as much. How long can you harass a peaceful man? How
can you kill the voluntarily dead? There is no zest in killing one
who welcomes death and therefore soldiers are keen upon seizing  the
enemy alive. If the mouse did not flee before the cat, the cat would

Gokhale desired by cable that polak should go to India and help him
in placing the facts of the situation before the Indian and Imperial
Governments.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>Polak’s
temperament was such that would make himself useful wherever he went.
He would be totally absorbed in whatever task he undertook. We were
therefore preparing to send him to India. I wrote to him<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

in person and taking full instructions from me. He therefore offered
to come and see me during our march. I wired to him,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3

be in so doing running the risk of arrest. Fighters never hesitate to
incur necessary risks. It was a cardinal principle of the movement
that everyone should be ready for arrest if Government extended their
attentions to him, and should make all straightforward and moral
efforts to get arrested until he overcame the reluctance of
Government to lay hands-upon him. Polak therefore preferred to come
even at the risk of being arrested.</p>

that I was a prisoner. And the advice which I would have given the
pilgrims would served the Government purpose no less than our own.
But how could an officer forgo an  opportunity  of  exercising  his 
brief  authority? I must say, however, that many officers understood
us better than this gentleman. They knew that not only had arrest no
terrors for us but on the other hand we hailed it as the gateway of
liberty. They therefore allowed us all legitimate freedom and
thankfully sought our aid in conveniently and expeditiously effecting

At about 9 o’clock in the morning on the 10th the pilgrims reached
Balfour where three special trains were drawn up at the station to
take them and deport them to Natal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>The pilgrims were there rather obstinate. They asked for
me to be called and promised to let themselves be arrested and to
board the trains if I advised them to that effect. This was a wrong
attiitude. And the whole game  must  be spoiled and the movement must
receive a set-back unless it was given up. Why should the pilgrims
want me for going to jail? It would ill become soldiers to claim to
elect their commanders or to insist upon their obeying only one of
them. Mr. Chamney approached Mr. Polak and Kachhalia Sheth to help
him in arresting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>them.
These friends encountered difficulty in explaining the situation to
the marchers. They told them that jail was the pilgrims’ goal and
they should therefore appreciate the Government’s action when they
were ready to arrest them. Only thus could the satyagrahis show their
quality and bring their struggle to a triumphant end. They must
realize that no other procedure could have my approval. The pilgrims
were brought round and all entrained peacefully.</p>

nothing of what transpired after I was separated from the pilgrims. I
asked for a remand once again. I said that a remand had been granted

destination. I therefore requested that  either  the  Government
should arrest  the  pilgrims  or  else  I  should  be permitted to
see them safe in Tolstoy Farm. The Magistrate did not comply with my
request, but promised to forward it at once tothe Government. This
time I was arrested on a warrant from Dundee where I was to be
prosecuted on the principal charge of inducing indentured labourers
to leave the province of Natal. I was therefore taken to Dundee by

Chamney even said that the Government had no intention Of arresting
him. But these were Mr. Chamney’s own views or the views of the

wished to be with the pilgrims. But Mr. Polakwas bound for India, and
was not deliberately courting jail at this moment. After a joint

Meanwhile, we passed a few happy days in Volksrust jail, where new
prisoners came every day and brought us news of what was happening
outside. Among these satyagrahi prisoners there was one old man named
Harbatsinh<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
who was about 75 years of age. Harbatsinh was not working on the
mines. He had completed his indenture years ago and he was not
therefore a striker. The Indians grew far more enthusiastic after my
arrest, and many of them got arrested by crossing over from Natal
into the Transvaal. Harbatsinh was one of these enthusiasts.</p>

honour cremated according to Hindu rites<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2

Government would not like that men should thus be attracted to jail,
nor did they appreciate the fact that prisoners upon their release
should carry messages outside. They therefore decided to separate
Kallenbach, Polak and me, send us away from Volksrust, and take me in
particular to a place where no Indian could go and see me. I was sent
accordingly to the jail in Bloemfontein, the capital of Orangia,
where there were not more than 50 Indians, all of them serving as
waiters in hotels. I was the only Indian prisoner there, the rest
being Europeans and Negroes. I was not troubled at this isolation but
hailed it as a blessing. There was no need now for me to keep my eyes
or ears open, and I was glad that a novel experience was in store for
me. Again, I never had had time for study for years together,
particularly since 1893, and the prospect of uninterrupted study for
a year filled me with joy.</p>

I reached Bloemfontein jail where I had as much solitude as I could
wish. There were many discomforts but they were all bearable, and I
will not inflict a description of them upon the reader. But I must
state that the medical officer of the jail became my friend. The
jailer could think only of his own powers while the doctor was
anxious to maintain the prisoners in their rights. In those days I
was purely a fruitarian. I took neither milk nor ghee nor food
grains. I lived upon  a diet of bananas, tomatoes, raw groundnuts,
limes and olive oil. It meant starvation for me if the supply of any
one of these things was bad in quality. The doctor was therefore very
careful in ordering them out, and he added almonds, walnuts and
Brazil nuts to my diet. He inspected in person everything indented
for me. There was not sufficient ventilation in the cell which was
assigned to me. The doctor tried his best to have the cell doors kept
open but in vain. The jailer threatened to resign if the doors were
kept open. He was not a bad man, but he had been moving in a single
rut from which he could not deviate. He had to deal with refractory
prisoners, and if he discriminated in favour of a mild prisoner like
myself, he would run the real risk of the turbulent prisoners getting
the upper hand of him.  I fully understood the jailer’s standpoint,
and in the disputes between the doctor and the jailer in respect of
me, my sympathies were always with the jailer who was an experienced,
straightforward man, seeing the way clear before him.</p>

The jeweller rubs gold on the touchstone. If he is not still
satisfied as to its purity, he puts it into the fire and hammers it
so that the dross if any is removed and only pure gold remains. The
Indians in South Africa passed through a similar test. They were
hammered, and passed through fire and had the hall-mark attached to
them only when they emerged unscathed through all the stages of
examination.</p>

The pilgrims were taken on special trains not for a picnic but for
baptism through fire. On the way the Government did not care to
arrange even to feed them and when they reached Natal, they were
prosecuted and sent to jail straightaway. We expected and even
desired as much. But the Government would have to incur additional
expenditure and would appear to have played into the Indians’ hands
if they kept thousands of labourers in prison. And the coal mines
would close down in the interval. If such a state of things lasted
for any length of time, the Government would be compelled to repeal
the</p>

£3 tax. They therefore struck out a new plan. Surrounding them with
wire netting, the Government proclaimed the mine compounds as
outstations to the Dundee and Newcastle jails and appointed the
mine-owners’ European staffs as the warders. In this way they
forced the labourers underground against their will and the mines
began to work once more. There is this difference between the status
of a servant and that of a slave, that if a servant leaves his post,
only a civil suit can be filed against him, whereas the slave who
leaves his master can be brought back to work by main force. The
labourers therefore were now reduced to slavery pure and simple.</p>

But that was not enough. The labourers were brave men, and they
flatly declined to work on the mines with the result that they were
brutally whipped. The insolent men dressed in a brief authority over
them kicked and abused them and heaped upon them other wrongs which
have never been placed on record. But the poor labourers</p>

It was then (December<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>1913)
that Lord Hardinge in Madras made his famous speech which created a
stir in South Africa as well as in England. The Viceroy may not
publicly criticize other members of the Empire, but Lord Hardinge not
only passed severe criticism upon the Union Government, but he also
wholeheartedly defended  the action of the satyagrahis and supported
their civil disobedience of unjust and invidious legislation. The
conduct of Lord Hardinge came in for some adverse comment in England,
but even then he did not repent but on the other hand asserted the
perfect propriety of the step he had been driven to adopt. Lord

Let us leave for the moment these brave but unhappy labourers
confined to their mines, and consider the situation in other parts of
Natal. The mines were situated in the north-west of Natal, but the
largest number of Indian labourers was to be found employed on the
north and the south coasts. I was fairly intimate with the labourers
on the north coast, that is, in and about Phoenix, Verulam, Tongaat,
etc., many of whom had served with me in the Boer War. I had not met
the labourers on the south coast from Durban to Isipingo and Umzinto
at such close quarters, and I had but few co-workers in those parts.
But the news of the strike and the arrests spread everywhere at
lightning speed, and thousands of labourers unexpectedly and
spontaneously came out on the south as well as on the north coast.
Some of them sold their household chattels from an impression that it
would be a long-drawn-out struggle and they could not expect to be 
fed  by others. When I went to jail, I had warned my co-workers
against allowing any more labourers to go on strike. I hoped that a
victory could be achieved only with the help of the miners. If all

the means of taking so many on the march; we had neither the men to

body of men it would be impossible to prevent a breach of the peace.</p>

But when the floodgates are opened, there is no checking the
universal deluge. The labourers everywhere struck work of their own
accord, and volunteers also posted themselves in the various places
to look after them.</p>

Government now adopted a policy of blood and iron. They prevented the
labourers from striking by sheer force. Mounted  military policemen
chased the strikers and brought them back to their work. The
slightest disturbance on the part of the labourers was answered by
rifle fire. A body of strikers resisted the attempt to take them back
to work. Some of them even threw stones. Fire was opened upon them,
wounding many and killing some. But the labourers refused to be cowed
down. The volunteers prevented a strike near Verulam with great
difficulty. But all the labourers did not return to work. Some hid
themselves for fear and did not go back.</p>

One incident deserves to be placed on record. Many labourers came out
in Verulam and would not return in spite of all the efforts of the
authorities. General Lukin was present on the scene with his soldiers
and was about to order his men to open fire. Brave Sorabji, son of
the late Parsi Rustomji, then hardly 18 years of  age,  had reached
here from Durban. He seized the reins of the General’s horse and
exclaimed, “You must not order firing. I undertake to induce my
people peacefully to return to work.” General Lukin was charmed
with the young man’s courage and gave him time to try his method of
love. Sorabji reasoned with the labourers who came round and returned
to their work. Thus a number of murders were prevented by the
presence of mind, valour and loving kindness of one young man.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The reader must observe that this firing and the treatment accorded
by the Government to the strikers on the coast were quite illegal.
There was an appearance of legality about the Government’s
procedure in respect of the miners who were arrested not for going on
strike but for entering the Transvaal without proper credentials. On
the north and the south coast however the very act of striking work
was treated as an offence not in virtue of any law but of the
authority of the Government. Authority takes the place of law in the
last resort.</p>

There is a maxim in English law that the king can do no wrong. The
convenience of the powers that be is the law in the final analysis.
This objection is applicable to all governments alike. And as a
matter of fact, it is not always objectionable thus to lay the
ordinary law onthe shelf. Sometimes adherence to ordinary law is
itself open to objection. When the authority charged with and pledged
to the public good is threatened with destruction by the restraints
imposed upon it, it is entitled in its discretion to disregard such
restraints. But occasions of such a nature must always be rare. If
the authority is in the habit of frequently exceeding the limits set?
upon it, it cannot be beneficial to the common weal. In the case
under consideration the authority had no reason whatever to act
arbitrarily. The labourer has enjoyed the right to strike from time
immemorial. The Government had sufficient material before them to
know that the strikers were not bent upon mischief. At the most the
strike was to result only in the repeal of the</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; line-height: 102%">
£3 tax. Only peaceful methods can be properly adopted against men of
peace. Again the authority in South Africa was not pledged to the
public good but existed for the exclusive benefit of the Europeans,
being generally hostile to the Indians. And therefore the breach of
all restraints on the part of such a partisan authority could never
be proper or excusable.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Thus in my view there was here a sheer abuse of authority, which
could never achieve the ends which it proposed to itself. There is
sometimes a momentary success, but a permanent solution cannot be
reached by such questionable methods. In South Africa the very £3
tax for bolstering up which the Government perpetrated all these
outrages had to be abolished within six months of the firing. Pain is
often thus the precursor of pleasure. The pain of the Indians in
South Africa made itself heard everywhere. Indeed, I believe, that as
every part has its place in a machine, every feature has its place in
a movement of men, and as a machine is clogged by rust, dirt and the
like, so is a movement hampered by a number of factors. We are merely
the instruments of the Almighty Will and are therefore often ignorant
of what helps us forward and what acts as an impediment. We must thus
rest satisfied with a knowledge only of the means and, if these are
pure, we can fearlessly leave the end to take care of itself.</p>

I observed, in this struggle, that its end drew nearer as the
distress of the fighters became more intense, and as the innocence of
the distressed grew clearer. I also saw that, in such a pure, unarmed</p>

and non-violent struggle, the very kind of material required for its
prosecution, be it men, money or munitions, is forthcoming at the
right moment. Many volunteers rendered spontaneous help, whom I do
not know even to this day. Such workers are generally selfless and
put in a sort of invisible service even in spite of themselves.No one
takes note of them, no one awards them a certificate of merit. Some
of them do not even know that their nameless  but priceless
unremembered acts of love do not escape the sleepless vigilance of
the recording angel.</p>

they were subjected. They entered the fire and emerged out of it

The reader has seen that the Indians exerted as much quiet strength
as they could and more than could be expected of them. He has also
seen that a very large majority of these passive resisters were poor,
downtrodden men of whom no the could possibly  be entertained. He
will recall too that all the responsible workers or the Phoenix
settlement with the exception of two or three were now in jail. Of
the workers outside Phoenix the late Sheth Ahmed Muhammad Kachhalia
was still at large, and so were Mr. West, Miss West and Maganlal
Gandhi in Phoenix. Kachhalia Sheth exercised general supervision.
Miss Schlesin kept all the Transvaal accounts and looked after the
Indians who crossed the border. Mr. West was in charge of the English
section of <i>Indian </i><i>Opinion </i>and of the cable
correspondence with Gokhale. At a ten like the present, when the
situation assumed a new aspect every moment, correspondence  by post
was out of the question. Cablegrams had to be despatched, no shorter
in length than letters, and the delicate responsibility regarding
them was shouldered by Mr. West.</p>

Like Newcastle in the mine area, Phoenix now became the centre of the
strikers on the north coast and was visited by hundreds of them who
came there to seek advice as well as shelter It therefore naturally
attracted the attention of the Government, and the angry looks of the
Europeans thereabouts. It became somewhat risky to live in Phoenix,
and yet even children there accomplished dangerous tasks with
courage. West was arrested in the meanwhile, though as a matter of</p>

fact there was no reason for arresting him. Our understanding was,
that West and Maganlal Gandhi should not only not try to be arrested,
but on the other hand should, as far as possible, avoid any occasion
for arrest, West had not therefore allowed any ground to arise for
the Government to arrest him. But the Government could scarcely
beexpected to consult the convenience of the satyagrahis, nor did
they need to wait for some occasion to arise for arresting anyone
whose freedom jarred upon their nerves. The authority’s very desire
take a step amply suffices as a reason for adopting it. As soon as
the news of the arrest of West was cabled to Gokhale, he initiated
the policy of sending out able men from India. When a meeting was
held in Lahore in support of the satyagrahis of South Africa, Mr. C.
F. Andrews gave away in their interest all the money in his
possession, and ever since then Gokhale had had his eye upon him. No
sooner, therefore, did he hear about West’s arrest than he inquired
of Andrews by wire if he was ready to proceed to South Africa at
once. Andrews replied in the affirmative. His beloved friend Pearson
also got ready to go the same moment and the two friends left India
for South Africa by the first available steamer.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

But the struggle was now about to close. The Union Government had not
the power to keep thousands of innocent men in jail. The Viceroy
would not tolerate it and all the world was waiting to see what
General Smuts would do. The Union Government now did what all
governments similarly situated generally do. No inquiry was really
needed. The wrong perpetrated was well known on all hands, and
everyone realized that it must be redressed. General Smuts too saw
that there had been injustice which called for remedy, but be was in
the same predicament as a snake which has taken a rat in its mouth
but can neither gulp it down nor cast it out. He must do justice, but
he had lost the power of doing justice, as he had given the Europeans
in South Africa to understand that he would not repeal the £3 tax
nor carry out any other reform. And now he felt compelled to abolish
the tax as well as to undertake other remedial legislation. States
amenable to public opinion get out of such awkward positions by
appointing a commission which conducts only a nominal inquiry, as as
recommendations are a foregone conclusion. It is a general practice
that the recommendations of such a commission should be accepted</p>

When Gokhale heard that a fresh march was under contemp- lation, he
sent a long cablegram, saying that such a step on our part would land
Lord Hardinge and himself in an awkward position and strongly
advising us to give up the march, end assist the commission by
tendering evidence before it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

We were on the horns of a dilemma. The Indians were pledged to a
boycott of the commission if its personnel was not enlarged to their
satisfaction. Lord Hardinge might be displeased, Gokhale might be
pained, but how could we go back upon our pledged word) Mr. Andrews
suggested to us the considerations of Gokhale’s feelings, his
delicate health and the shock which our decision was calculated to
impart to him. But in fact these considerations were never absent
from my mind. The leaders held a conference and finally reached the
decision that the boycott must stand at any cost if more members were
not co-opted to the commission. We therefore sent a long cablegram to
Gokhale, at an expense of about a hundred pounds.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>Andrews too concurred with the gist of our message which
was to the following effect:</p>

‘We realize how you are pained, and would like to follow your
advice at considerable sacrifice. Lord Hardinge has rendered
priceless aid, which we wish we would continue to receive till the
end. But we are anxious that you should understand our position. It
is a question of thousands of men having taken a pledge to which no
exception can be taken. Our entire struggle has ken built upon a
foundation of pledges. Many of us would have fallen back today had it
not been for the compelling force of our pledges. All moral bonds
would  be relaxed at once if thousands of men once proved false to
their plighted word. The pledge was taken after full and mature</p>

This cable, when it reached Gokhale, had an adverse effect upon his

our standpoint. Lord Hardinge too remained unmoved.</p>

I went to Pretoria with Andrews. Just at this time there was a great
strike of the European employees of the Union railways, which made
the position of the Government extremely delicate. I was called upon
to commence the Indian march at such a fortunate juncture. But  I
declared that the Indians could not thus assist the railway strikers,
as they were not out to harass the Government, their struggle being
entirely different and differently conceived.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Even if we undertook the march, we would begin it at
some other time when the railway trouble had ended. This decision of
ours created a deep impression, and was cabled to England by Reuter.
Lord Ampthill cabled his congratula- tions from England. English
friends in South Africa too appreciated our decision. One of the
secretaries of General Smuts jocularly said: “I do not like your
people, and do not care to assist them at all. But what am I to do?
You help us in our days of need. How can we lay hands upon you? I
often wish you took to violence like the English strikers, and then
we would know at once how to dispose of you. But you will not injure
even the enemy. You desire victory by self-suffering alone and never
transgress your self-imposed limits of courtesy and chivalry. And
that is what reduces us to sheer helplessness.” General Smuts also
gave expression to similar sentiments.</p>

I need scarcely suggest to the reader that this was not the first
incident of chivalrous consideration for others being shown by the
satyagrahis. When the Indian labourers on the north coast went on
strike, the planters at Mount Edgecombe would have been put to great
losses if all the cane that had been cut was not brought to the mill
and crushed. Twelve hundred<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>Indians therefore returned to work solely with a view to
finishing this part of the work, and joined their compatriots only
when it was finished. Again when the Indian employees of the Durban
Municipality struck work, those whowere engaged in the sanitary
services of the borough or as attendants upon the patients in
hospitals were sent back, and they willingly returned to their
duties. If the sanitary services were dislocated,and if there was no
one to attend upon the patients in hospitals, there might be an
outbreak of disease in the city and the sick would be deprived of
medical aid, and no satyagrahi would wish for such consequences to
ensure. Employees of this description were therefore exempted from
the strike. In every step that he takes, the satyagrahi is bound to
consider the position of his adversary.</p>

Mr. Andrews and I reached Pretoria. But I alone was to interview
General Smuts. The General was preoccupied with the railways strike,
which was so serious in nature that the Union Government had declared
martial law. The European workmen not only demanded higher wages, but
aimed at taking the reins of government into their hands. My first
interview with the General was very short,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>but I saw that he did not then ride the same high horse
as he did before, when the Great March began. At that time the
General would not so much as talk with me. The threat of satyagraha
was the same then as it was now. Yet he had declined to enter into
negotiations. But now he was ready to confer with me.The Indians had
demanded that a member should be cot opted to the commission to
represent Indian interests. But on this point General Smuts would not
give in. “That cannot be done”, said he, “as it would be
derogatory to the Government’s prestige, and I would be unable to
carry out the desired reforms. You must understand that Mr. Esselen
is our man, and would fall in with, not oppose, the Government’s
wishes as regards reform. Colonel Wylie is a man of position in Natal
and might even be considered anti-Indian. If therefore even he agrees
to a repeal of the £3 tax, the Government will have an easy task
before them. Our troubles are manifold; we have not a moment to spare
and therefore wish to set the Indian question at rest. We have
decided to grant your demands, but for this we must have a
recommendation from the commission. I understand your position too.
You have solemnly declared that you will not lead evidence before it
so long as there is no representative of the Indians sitting on the

should not organize any active propaganda to prevent anyone who
wishes to give evidence from doing so, and should suspend satyagraha
in the interval. I believe that by so doing you will be serving your
own interests as well as giving me a respite. As you will not tender
evidence, you will not be able to prove your allegations as regards
ill-treatment accorded to the Indian strikers. But that is for you to
think over.”</p>

Such were the suggestions of General Smuts, which on the whole  I was
inclined to receive favourably. We had made many complaints about
ill-treatment of strikers by soldiers and warders,  but  the
difficulty was that we were precluded by a boycott of the commission
from proving our allegations. There was a difference of opinion</p>

among the Indians on this point. Some held that the charges levelled
by the Indians against the soldiers must be proved, and therefore
suggested that if the evidence could not be placed before the
commission, we must challenge libel proceedings by publishing the
authentic evidence in our possession. I disagreed with these friends.
There was little likelihood of the commission giving a decision
unfavourable to the Government. Challenging libel proceedings would
land the community in endless trouble, and the net result would be
the barren satisfaction of having proved the charges of
ill-treatment. As a barrister, I was well aware of the difficulties
of proving the truth of statements giving rise to libel proceedings.
But my weightiest argument was that the satyagrahi is out to suffer.
Even before satyagraha was started, the satyagrahis knew that they
would have tosuffer even unto death, and they were ready to: undergo
such suffering. Such being the case, there was no sense in proving
now that they did suffer. A spirit of revenge being alien to
satyagraha, it was best for a satyagrahi to hold his peace when he
encountered extraordinary difficulties in proving the fact of his
suffering. A satyagrahi fights only for essentials. The essential
thing was that the obnoxious laws should be repealed or suitably
amended, and when this was fairly within his grasp, he need not
bother himself with other things. Again a satyagrahi’s silence
would at the time of settlement stand him in good stead in his
resistance to unjust laws. With such arguments I was able to win over
most of these friends who differed from me, and we decided to drop
the idea of proving our allegations of ill-treatment.</p>

Mr. Andrews and I had had frequent interviews with General Smuts
before these letters were exchanged.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>But meanwhile Sir Benjamin Robertson too arrived at
Pretoria. Sir Benjamin was looked upon as a popular official, and he
brought a letter of recommendation from Gokhale, but I observed that
he was not entirely free from the usual weakness of the English
official. He had no sooner come than he began to create factions
among the Indians and to bully the satyagrahis. My first meeting<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>with him in Pretoria did not prepossess me in his
favour. I told him about the telegrams I had received informing me of
his bullying procedure. I dealt with him, as indeed with everyone
else, in a frank and straightforward manner, and we therefore became
friends. But I have often seenthat officials are apt to bully those
who will tamely submit to them, and will be correct with those who
are correct themselves and will not be cowed down.</p>

We thus reached a provisional agreement<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">3</font></sup>,
and satyagraha was suspended for the last time. Many English friends
were glad of this, and promised their assistance in the final
settlement. It was rather difficult to get the Indians to endorse
this agreement. No one would wish that enthusiasm which had arisen
should be allowed to subside. Again, who ever would trust General
Smuts? Some reminded me of the fiasco in 1908, and said, “General
Smuts once played us false, often charged you with forcing fresh
issues, and subjected the community to endless suffering. And yet
what a pity that you have not learnt the necessary lesson of
declining to trust him ! This man will betray you once again, and you
will again propose to revive satyagraha. but who will then listen to
you? Is it possible that men should every now and then go to jail,

I knew that such arguments would be brought forward<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and was not therefore surprised when they were. No
matter how often a satyagrahi is betrayed, he will continue to repose
his trust in the adversary so long as there are not cogent grounds
for distrust. Pain to a satyagrahi is the same as pleasure. He will
not therefore be misled by the mere fear of suffering into groundless
distrust. On the other hand, relying as he does upon his own
strength, he will not mind being betrayed by the adversary, will
continue to trust in spite of frequent betrayals, and will believe
that he thereby strengthens the forces of truth and brings victory
nearer. Meetings<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2 </font></sup>were
therefore held in various places, and I was able at last to persuade
the Indians to approve of the terms of the agreement. The Indians now
came to a better understanding of the spirit of satyagraha. Mr.
Andrews was the mediator and the witness in the present agreement,
and then there was Sir Benjamin Robertson as representing the
Government of India. There was therefore the least possible
likelihood of the agreement being subsequently repudiated. If I had
obstinately refused to accept theagreement, it would have become a
count of indictment against the Indians, and the victory which was
achieved in the next six months would have been beset with various
obstacles. The author of the Sanskrit saying, ‘Forgiveness is an
ornament to the brave’, drew upon his rich experience of
satyagrahis never giving any one the least opportunity of finding
fault with them. Distrust is a sign of weakness and satyagraha
implies the banishment of all weakness and therefore of distrust,
which is clearly out of place when the adversary is not to be
destroyed but to be won over.</p>

When the agreement was thus endorsed by the Indians, we had only to
wait for the next session of the Union Parliament. Meanwhile the
commission set to work. Only a very few  witnesses  appeared before

great hold which the satyagrahis had acquired over the community. Sir

to effect a settlement of their long-standing dispute with the
Indians; and I went at once to Cape Town where the Union Parliament
sits. The Bill contained 9 sections and would take up only  two 
columns of a paper like <i>Young India</i>. One part of it dealt with
the question of Indian marriages and validated in South Africa the
marriages which were held legal in India, except that if a man had
more wives than one, only one of them would at any time be recognized
as his legal wife in South Africa. The  second  part abolished the
annual licence of £3 to be taken out by every indentured Indian
labourer who failed to return to India and settled in the country as
a free man on the completion of his indenture. The third part
provided that the domicile certificates issued by the Government to
Indians in Natal and bearing the thumb-impression of the holder of

Administrative matters which did not come under the Indians, Relief
Bill were set led by correspondence between General Smuts and me, as
for example, safeguarding the educated Indians’ right of entry into
the Cape Colony, allowing ‘specially exempted’ educated Indians
to enter South Africa, the status of educated Indians who had entered
South Africa within the last three years,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>and permitting existing plural wives to join their
husbands in South Africa. After dealing with all these points,
General Smuts in his letter of June 30, 1914, added:</p>

“The passing of the Indians’ Relief Bill and this correspon-
dence finally closed the satyagraha struggle which commenced in the
September of 1906, and which to the Indian community cost much
physical suffering and pecuniary loss and to the Government much
anxious thought and consideration.“As you are aware, some of my
countrymen have wished me to go further. They are dissatisfied that
the Trade Licence laws of the different provinces, the Transvaal Gold
Law, the Transvaal Townships Act, the Transvaal Law 3 of 1885 have
not been altered so as to give them full rights of residence, trade
and ownership of land. Some of them are dissatisfied that full inter-
provincial migration is not permitted, and some are dissatisfied that
on the marriage question the Relief Bill goes no further than it
does. They have asked me that all the above matters might be included
in the satyagraha struggle. I have been unable to comply with their
wishes. Whilst, therefore, they have not been included in the
programme of satyagraha, it will not be denied that some day or other
these matters will require further and sympathetic consideration by

“I have told my countrymen that they will have to exercise
patience, and by all honourable means at their disposal educate
public opinion so as to enable the Government of the day to go
further than the present correspondence does. I shall hope when the
Europeans of South Africa fully appreciate the fact that now the
importation of indentured labour from India is prohibited, and the
Immigrants Regulation Act of last year has in practice all but
stopped further free Indian immigration, and that my countrymen do
not entertain any political ambition, they, the Europeans, will see
the justice and indeed the necessity of my countrymen being granted
the rights I have just referred to.</p>

Thus the great satyagraha struggle closed after eight years, and it
appeared that the  Indians  in  South  Africa  were  now  at  peace. 
On July 18, 1914, I sailed for England, to meet Gokhale, on my way
back to India, with mixed feelings of pleasure and regret,—pleasure
because I was returning home after many years and eagerly looked
forward to serving the country under Gokhale’s guidance, regret
because it was a great wrench for me to leave South Africa, whereI
had passed twenty-one years of my life sharing to thefull in the
sweets and bitters of human experience, and where I had realized my
vocation in life.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup></p>

When one considers the painful contrast between the happy ending of
the satyagraha struggle and the present condition of the Indians in
South Africa, one feels for a moment as if all this suffering had
gone for nothing, or is inclined to question the efficacy of
satyagraha as a solvent of the problems of mankind. Let us here
consider this point for a little while. There is a law of nature that

thing can be retained by the same means by which it has been 
acquired. A thing acquired by violence can be retained by violence
alone, while one acquired by truth can be retained only by truth. The
Indians in South Africa, therefore, can ensure their safety today if
they can wield the weapon of satyagraha. There are no  such
miraculous properties in satyagraha, that a thing acquired by truth
could be retained even when truth was given up. It would not be
desirable even if it was possible. If therefore the position of
Indians in South Africa has now suffered deterioration, that argues
the absence of satyagrahis among them. There is no question here of
finding fault with the present generation of South African Indians,
but of merely stating the facts of the case. Individuals or bodies of
individuals  cannot borrow from others qualities which they
themselves do not possess. The satyagrahi veterans passed away one
after another. Sorabji, Kachhalia, Thambi Naidoo, Parsi Rustomji and
others are no more, and there are very few now who passed through the
fire of satyagraha. The few that remain are still in the fighting
line, and I have not a shadow of a doubt that they will be the
saviours of the community on the day of its trial if the light of
satyagraha is burning bright within them.</p>

Finally, the reader of these pages has seen that had it not been for
this great struggle<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>and
for the untold sufferings which many Indians invited upon their
devoted heads, the Indians today-would have been hounded out of South
Africa. Nay, the victory achieved by Indians in South Africa more or
less served as a shield for Indian emigrants in other parts of the
British Empire, who, if they are suppressed, will be suppressed
thanks to the absence of satyagrahaamong themselves, and to India’s
inability to protect them, and not because of any flaw in the weapon
of satyagraha. I will consider myself amply repaid if I have in these
pages demonstrated with some success that Satyagraha is a priceless
and matchless weapon, and that those who wield it are Strangers to
disappointment or defeat.</p>

was agreed between the two Governments, before they left India, that
if they fulfilled their five years’ labour contract on the sugar
plantations they should be given certain rights in Natal, including
those of domicile together with open purchase of land and immovable

indentured Indian labour, also agreed that Indian traders should be

Mr. Andrews could have added that in other parts of South Africa the
Indian position is infinitely worse than in Durban. In the major part
of the Union he is landles and is dependent purely on the goodwill of
his European landlord. His only crime is that besides being a
labourer he dares to engage in trade and eke out an honest living.
Dispassionately examined, the cry against the Asiatic has no
foundation save in an insensate colour prejudice and petty trade
jealousy.</p>

what would happen to literature if ticket-collectors ruled these

As to the question embodied in the letter, I must repeat what I have
said in these columns before that I retain my faith intact in the
original programme of non-co-operation. I also feel that it has done
a distinct service to national cause. The institutions attacked do 
not retain the glamour they had before. But I recognize that the
reaction too has been great and that many of those who were concerned
with the institutions in question have gone back to them. But  I  am 
confident that at the proper time the whole programme is bound to be
revived, in a modified form it may be, but retaining its essential
character. Meanwhile as a practical man I help my old comrades in
very humble way I can without sacrificing my own principles or
practice.</p>

As for the extract from the Swedish newspaper, it betrays the usual
ignorance of my motives and actions. I am not concerned with doing
away with the railways. The spread of the spinning-wheel I hold to be
quite consistent with the existence of the railways. The spinning-
wheel is designed to revive the national cottage industry and thus
bring about a natural and equitable distribution  of  the  wealth
derivable from the largest industry next only to agriculture and 
thereby stop the double evil of enforced idlenes and pauperism. Nor
have I ever suggested or contemplated the turning out of the English
from India. What I do contemplate is a radical change in the English
outlook upon the Government of India. The present unnatural and
degrading system of subtle slavery must be changed at  any  cost.
There is no room for Englishmen as masters. There is room for them</p>

if they will remain as friends and helpers. The writer of the article
simply does not understand the grand implications of the removal of
untouchability. He cannot per-ceive that its removal is calculated to
purge Hinduism of greatest evil that has crept into it, without
touching the great system of division of work. It is difficult, it
must be admitted, for busy men looking at the great movement from a
distance to  observe the unfamiliar but vital core beneath the
temporary but familiar crust overlaying it. It is difficult for them
also not to mistake the husk for the kernel. The movement of
non-violent non-co- operation has nothing in common with the
historical struggles for freedom in the West. It is not based on
brute force or hatred. It does not aim at destroying the tyrant. It
is a movement of self-purification. It therefore seeks to convert the
tyrant. It may fail because India may not be ready for mass
non-violence. But it would be wrong to judge the movement by false
standards. My own opinion is that the movement has in no way failed.
Non-violence has found an abiding place in India’s struggle for
freedom. That the programme could not be finished in a year’s time
merely shows that the people could not cope with a mighty upheaval
during such a short time. But it is a leaven which is silently but
surely working its way among the masses.</p>

The Government of Bombay has plainly told the Anjuman of Broach that
if they want prohibition they must find fresh sources of revenue to
replace the revenue derived from drink. In other words it is no
concern of the Government to arrest the evil of drink. It is the duty
of the reformer to supply the revenue lost by return to sobriety.
Prohibitionists therefore, if they want early prohibition, will have
to make up their minds as to their reply to H. E. the Governor  of 
Bombay which represents in this case the policy of the Government of
India. I hold it to be utterly unjust to further tax the already
over- taxed taxpayer. Prohibition can only come by cutting down
expenditure. The military budget is the item that easily admits of
retrenchment. But whether this opinion is sound or not,
prohibitionists have to formulate their policy as to the method of
meeting the difficulty raised by the Governor of Bombay.</p>

Protests in India notwithstanding, the Union Parliament has passed
the anti-colour legislation. This does not so materially affect
Indian settlers as the natives of the soil. They and Asiatics are
virtually debarred by this legislation from doing any work on the
mines which Europeans can or will do. It is an unnecessary affront
put upon Indians. For there are very few working on the mines. So far
as the natives are concerned the legislation not only reduces their
legal status but it also affects the material interest of thousands
working on the mines. No wonder General Smuts uttered a grave note of
waring against the legislation and likened it to a fire-brand thrown
in a haystack. The Bill is a challenge to the Natives. Illiterate
though they may be, they are as proud and sensitive as any people on
earth. In their helplessness they may be unable to answer the
challenge but there is no doubt that the Europeans of South Africa if
they persist in their arrogant policy will have sown the seeds of
their own destruction. It is stated that the Senate will reject the
measure when it comes before it. It ought to But the same cable tells
us that the existing Government have a majority in the combined
Houses which they propose to use in order to carry out their purpose.
If this temper continues, the anti- Asiatic measure which is
agitating India at the present moment is not likely to be postponed
as Mr. Andrews hopes it will. These measures really hang together and
represent the settled policy of the present Union Government on the
question of colour. Only the strongest attitude on the part of the
government of India can bring about a reconsideration of that policy.</p>

	I was delighted to receive your letter just before your departure
	for America where I hope you and Mrs. Fisher will have a good time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
	I have no doubt that whatever the present result of the South
	African struggle, the seed sown by you and now being watered by Mr.
	Andrews will bear ample fruit in its own time. I cannot be dislodged
	from my faith in the ultimate triumph of truth which to my mind is
	the only thing that counts. The downs of life on the way to it will
	have been all forgotten when we have attained the summit.</p>

	Mrs. Fisher asked me for a message. I can only repeat what I have
	been saying to so many American friends who have been calling on me,
	namely, what is required most is serious and careful study of the
	Indian movement. What I see happening in America is distressful,
	either an exaggerated view of the movement or a belittling of it.
	Both are alike distrortions. I regard the movement to be one of
	permanent interest and fraught with very important consequences. It
	therefore needs a dilligent study, not a mere superficial newspaper
	glance. May your visit to America then result in the more accurate
	estimate of the movement in India.</p>

I have already started dictating English. From today I intend to
dictate Gujarati also and manage it. If I do not do this, work will
pile up or I shall not be able to rest. Your chest pain must have
gone now. Until summer sets in, even this place is like a health
resort. There is no end to the conveniences available. And I am able
to take as much rest as I want. As far as possible I do not interfere
with the other activities in the Ashram.</p>

	I have been receiving your letters regularly. Please do not think
	that you are unworthy to be my disciple. I regard myself as too
	imperfect to have any disciples. Do not for one moment think that
	those who are living with me at the Ashram I regard as my disciples.
	They are all co-workers with me. I am in the position of an elder to
	them. And I am an elder because I may be considered to be more
	experienced then they are and my experience is at their disposal
	equally with theirs. There is no secret either about the royal road
	I told you of. The royal road is the doing of one’s appointed duty
	to the best of one’s ability and the dedication of all service to
	God. Work done in this fashion always clears difficulties in front
	of us and shows us also whenever we err. You should certainly
	continue the union amongst your friends of the little circle you
	have mentioned and my advice will be always at your disposal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 95%">

I fear that for myself personally your medicine will be useless
because I can take only one or two ingredients in any 24 hours, as I
can take only five ingredients during that period whether in the
shape of medicine or food. Thus if your pill contains more than one
ingredient, I must not take it because I should then have no food.</p>

And I may say the same thing of my admission about the bad dreams. It
would do the world a lot of harm if I claimed to be a perfect
<i>brahmachari </i>without being one. For it would sully <i>brahmacharya
</i>and dim the lustre of truth. How dare I undervalue <i>brahmacharya
</i>by false pretences? I can see today that the means I suggest for
the observance of <i>brahmacharya </i>are not adequate, are not found
to be invariably efficacious, because I am not a perfect <i>brahmachari.
</i>It would be an awful thing for the world to be allowed to believe
that I was a perfect <i>brahmachari, </i>whilst I could not show the
royal road to <i>brahmacharya.</i></p>

Why should it not be sufficient for the world to know that I am a
genuine seeker, that I am wide awake, and that my striving is
ceaseless and unbending?  Why should not this knowledge be sufficient
encouragement to others? It is wrong to deduce conclusions from false
premises. It is wisest to draw them from things achieved. Why argue
that because a man like me could not escape unclean thoughts, there
is no hope for the rest? Why not rather argue that if a Gandhi who
was once given to lust can today live as friend and brother to his
wife and can look upon the fairest damsel as his sister or daughter,
there is hope for the lowliest and the lost? If God was merciful to
one who was so full of lust, certainly all the rest would have his
mercy too!</p>

The friends of the correspondent who were put back because of a
knowledge of my imperfections had never gone forward at all. It was a
false virtue that fell at the first blast. The truth and observance
of <i>brahmacharya </i>and similar eternal principles do not depend
on person imperfect as myself. They rest on the sure foundations of
the penance of the many who strove for them and lived them in their
fullness. When I have the fitness to stand alongside those perfect
beings, there will be much more determination and force in my
language than today. He whose thoughts do not wander and think evil,
whose sleep knows no dreams and who can be wide awake even whilst
asleep, is truly healthy. He does not need to take quinine. His
incorruptible blood will have the inherent virtue of resisting all
infections. It is for</p>

correspondent, his friends of little faith, and others to join me in
that striving, and I wish that they may go forward even like the

No one need therefore despair. My Mahatmaship is worthless. It is due
to my outward activities, due to my politics which is the least part
of me and is therefore evanescent. What is of abiding worth is my
insistence on truth, non-violence and <i>bramacharya </i>which is the
real part of me. That permanent part of me however small, is not to

	I have your letter. I know that it is a matter of shame for me to
	have become ill. I am taking now double precautions. I shall leave
	no stone unturned to present myself in a fit condition at the end of
	the year. And, if you have any homoeopathic pills that will
	guarantee an absolute cure and turn me into a youth of 26 instead of
	an old man of 56, pass those pills on to me and I shall take as many
	as you want me to every day!</p>

	I am so glad Jawaharlal and Kamla are going and with them Swarup and
	Ranjit. I am not surprised at Krishna not wanting to be left behind.
	I do hope it will be possible to squeeze her in somehow or other so
	that she can have as much outing as possible. I expect great results
	from this trip, not only for Kamla but also for Jawaharlal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.31cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
	Yes. I did take note of the fact that you were present at the
	Conference between the Viceroy and the leaders of the two Houses. I
	am glad that you were one of the party.</p>

	If all the Assembly Committees will have to be given up, I very much
	fear that the Skeen Committee<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
	</font></sup>will have to be treated likewise, though the technical
	distinction that you point out is there, it will not be enough for
	our purpose. Though personally I dislike the idea of the Skeen
	Committee having to be given up by you, if it is good to come out of
	the Councils, it will be necessary to come out of the Skeen
	Committee.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
	I should be delighted if you could at all come even for a day during
	the month. As you thrive on difficulties, I hope that you are
	keeping perfectly fit and strong.</p>

	Not every man who says I am a congressman or carries about him a

	of the Congress to the letter and in the spirit; and therefore he,
	in my opinion, is a Congressman who is an out and out believer in
	khaddar; who wears khaddar himself not as a makeshift or for show,
	but with sincerity; who believes in the removal of untouchability
	and freely associates with the so-called untouchables; who believes

I have your long letter, but you need not at all be sorry for having
written a long letter. I have read it with great interest. You should
stay there only on condition that your health improves, even if
slowly. You should not be greedy to acquire knowledge of merely
external things. It is desirable to be content with what one learns
in the ordinary course of things. If we do not do that, so wide is
the extent of such knowledge that it would take your whole  life-time
 and  you would be able to do no service, let alone realize the self.</p>

The Colour Bar Bill is making steady progress. On principle, it is
just as bad as the Asiatic measure and therefore just as open to
objection as the latter. Its progress evidences the Union
Government’s intention and determination abut the Asiatic Bill. It
is becoming daily clearer that the Union Government intend if
possible to stiffen the measure rather than relax it. The proposed
amendment of the Section 10 gives no relief worth the name and the
inclusion of the Cape has roused against the Bill even a section of
the South African Press so much that one paper goes so far as to
insinuate that it is probably out of spite against Dr. Abdur Rahman’s
doings in India that the S. A. Government seek to include the Cape in
the scope of the Bill. Let us hope that whatever else that Government
may be guilty of, it is not guilty of the little- ness ascribed to
it. Be that as it may, there is no doubt about the mind of that
Government. It is this root-and-branch policy that the Indian
settlers have to face and combat. They can do so successfully, if
they have a strong backing from the Imperial and the Indian
Governments. This they will not have. The Indian Government is a
shadow of the Imperial. The latter is neither feared not respected by
the present Union Government. On the contrary it fears the Union
Government lest South Africa may secede from the Imperial
partnership. It is the case of the tail wagging the dog. The Imperial
Government would never assert itself against South Africa unless
there was fear of losing India. The apparent collapse of non-
co-operation has given the Imperial Government a new hope about
India’s helpless ness. At the crucial moment therefore the weight
of authority will be thrown on the side of South Africa unless the
unexpected hap-pens this side of the Indian Ocean. The ultimate
passing of the Bill, even though it may be postponed for the present
session, is thus assured.</p>

What are then our countrymen in South Africa to do? There is nothing
in the world like self-help. The world helps those who help
themselves. Self-help in this case, as perhaps in every other, means
self-suffering, self-suffering means satyagraha. When their honour is
at stake, when their rights are being taken away, when their
livelihood is threatened, they have the right and it becomes their
duty to offer satyagraha. They offered it during 1907 and 1914 and
won  the support even of the Government of India, indeed the
recognition of the Europeans and the Government of South Africa. They
can do likewise again if they have the will and the courage to suffer
for the common good.</p>

diplomatic remedy. They must await the result of the negotiations the</p>

Government of India are carrying on with the Union Government. And
when they have explored and tried every other available channel and
failed to find a way out, the case for satyagraha is complete. Then
it would be cowardice to flinch. And victory is a certainty. No power
on earth can make a person do a thing against his will. Satyagraha is
a direct result of the recognition of this great Law and is
independent of numbers participating in it.</p>

Terms of satyagraha are imperative, admitting of no exception. There
should be no violence in any shape or form. There must be an
irreducible minimum—a minimum that would commend itself to any
reasonable and impartial judge. We may be justly entitled to many
things but satyagraha is offered for things without which
self-respect, or which is the same thing, honourable existence, is
impossible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
They must count the cost. Satyagraha cannot be offered in bravado or
as a mere trial. It is a measure of the depth of one’s feeling. It
is therefore offered because it becomes irresistible. No price is too
dear to pay for it, i.e., truth. Success comes when it is least
expected. It is undertaken not from a belief in human aid but it is
based upon an unquenchable faith in God and His justice. And God is
both gentle and hard. He tries us through and through to the last
suffering point but He is so gentle as never to test us to the
breaking point.</p>

After this pronouncement one would expect a description of prison
reform being attempted or pending in Bengal. Instead,  however, H. E.
the Governor of Bengal quoted two instances of successful
humanitarian effort in England and said:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.17cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">You
may ask why I have chosen to speak to you about this subject. The
reason is that this is work which no Government can do. Governments
only hamper and spoil work of this kind by interference, it must be
done by those who have the calling.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
Having thus absolved his and all governments from responsibility for
the much needed reform, he threw it on the broad and “idealistic”
shoulders of the Rotarians present.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
As an old and experienced prisoner, however, I believe that
governments have to begin the reform Lord Lytton will have his
hearers to undertake. Humanitarians can but supplement government
efforts. As it is, the humanitarian, if he attempted anything, will
first have to undo the mischief done in prisons where the environment
hardens the criminal tendency, and in the case of innocent prisoners
they learn how to commit crimes without being detected. I hold that
humanitarian effort cannot cope with the evil wrought in the jails.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
Lord Lytton must have recognized this patent fact when in his
introduction he talked of substituting “reformation for retribution
as the basis of our Penal Code”. But evidently in winding up his
speech he forgot that he had intended his Penal Code to be the basis
of reform, and as he realized that he had no reform to show to the
credit of his government, wound up by saying that it was no business
of governments to attempt the reform.</p>

If, as Lord Lytton correctly put it, punishment must be inflicted
purely for protection of society, mere detention should be enough and
that too only till the detenus can be fairly presumed to have been
cured of their evil habits or securities are found for their good
behaviour. There can be no difficulty about a scientific
classification of prisoners, apportionment of work from a
humanitarian standpoint, selection of better-class warders, abolition
of the system of appointing prisoners as warders, and a host of other
changes that one might easily suggest.</p>

According to Lord Lytton’s own standard, the detention of political
prisoners without trial and their reported ill-treatment  is  wholly
wrong. It is to be wished that His Excellency will apply his own
admirable tests to the administration of his own jails, and there is
no doubt that he will make startling discoveries in the shape of
reforms that can be easily attempted by his government far more
easily than anything that humanitarians can ever hope to attempt or
achieve.</p>

The recent debate in the Assembly over the proposal to appoint two
additional judges to the Privy Council for the purpose of hearing
Indian appeals has revived the controversy about the location of this
final court of appeal. If it were not for the hypnotism under which
we are labouring we would see without effort the futility, the
sinfulness, of going five thousand miles away to get (or buy?)
justice. It is said that at that delightful distance the judges are
able to decide cases with greater detachment and impartiality than
they would if they had to hear appeals, say in Delhi. The moment the
argument is examined it breaks down. Must the poor Londoners have
their Privy Council in Delhi? And what should the French and the
Americans do? Must the</p>

French by arrangement have their final court of appeal in America and
the Americans in France? What should we do if India was an
independent country? Or is India an exceptional “case’ requiring
special favoured treatment giving the right of appeal in far off
London? Let one quote in support of the seat of the Privy Council in
London the case of the great Colonies. They retain the anachronism
out of sentiment. And the movement is on foot in several Colonies to
have their final courts of appeal in their own homes. The sentiment
in India is the other way. A self-respecting India would never
tolerate the location of her final court of appeal anywhere else but
in India.</p>

The Secretary, A.I.S.A.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1</font></sup>,
has received a letter from the Chittoor District Khadi Board giving
valuable information about khadi made from self-spun yarn from
September to December 1925. I take the following<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">2
</font></sup>from that letter:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
The value of the information given in the foregoing lies in the fact
that the self-spinners include lawyers, graduates, a Municipal
Councillor, an M.L.C. and an M.L.A. who perhaps have their clothes
made partly or wholly from self-spun yarn, not for the sake of saving
money, but for love of the thing. Farmers such as Natha Patel whose
story Mahadev Desai relates in another column spin and weave their
own yarn predominantly for the sake of saving considerable expenses.
As he himself says, his yearly expense for the family was no less
than Rs. 250. Thus khadi has both an economic and a sentimental
value, both to be equally cherished.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 110%">
Whilst I can congratulate the organizers and the spinners on their
energy and devotion, I am sorry I am unable to endorse the scheme
that has been sketched by the correspondent in order to enourage
self-spinning. He promises to give as present one towel to every
spinner who spins at a recognized club for one hour every day for 30
days, and he promises further to weave the yarn free for those</p>

I think that if these promises are meant for the class of spinners
mentioned in the letter reproduced by me, it is an undesirable temp-
tation. M.L.Cs, M.L.A.s and lawyers may not have their yarn spun free
of charge. The whole value of their work at the spinning-wheel is
lost if they spin because there is a substantial prize to be obtained
at the end of their spinning. Such men should spin for the love of
it. The satisfaction of wearing cloth made out of yarn spun by
themselves must be its own full reward. Prizes are meant for
unwilling spinners. They may also be given to willing spinners who
are needy and for whom every pice saved is so much added to their
bread and butter.</p>

The idea of giving self-spinners free slivers is really tentamount to
encouraging beggary. Why should men who can afford have free slivers,
when the yarn spun is to be their own property? Surely, it is enough
that they get facilities for spinning and all the attention that may
be necessary to make them accomplished spinners. Free slivers can
only be given to paupers in order to enable them to earn a living and
in order to encourage them to work, because idleness seems at the
present moment to be spreading in the nation. What was at one time
forced upon us is becoming a vice with us. Let it never be forgotten
by khadi workers that the whole plan of khadi is based upon the
supposition that there are millions of people living in utter
starvationor semi-starvation, and they are so living for want of work
either during the whole of the year or at least a third of the year.
Therefore every rupee that is spent by Khadi Associations must, so
far as it is possible, find its way directly into the pockets of
these starving millions and even then not as a free gift but as an
equivalent for some work done.</p>

	A glance even by a lay reader at the original section and the
	amendment would clearly show that the amendment is  infinitely worse
	than the original. There is not therefore even an attempt at any
	compromise, but a defiance of Indian opinion, indeed even of the
	Government of India. This attitude of the Union Government is in
	keeping with the furious agitation which has been engineered against
	the Asiatics in South Africa.</p>

	If you too fall ill, how can we find fault with others? Now I need
	not blame myself. If a life celibate can claim the privilege of
	falling ill, how much more should one like me claim who am
	endeavouring to change the mould in which I have been cast? We must

do not quit our personal work; on the contrary we seek to accomplish
it at any cost. We must have a similar attitude  towards  the
philanthropic or religious work which we undertake. Neither of you
can therefore throw away the responsibility just by saying so. You
have undertaken the work on your own and if you now want to get out
of it you can do so only after making proper alternative
arrangements. I can understand the difficulty that you both face. I
write this only to point out your duty. I had written a letter to you
even before I got yours. I still mean what I have written in it. That
centre is a liability of the Parishad or the Charkha Sangh or the
Khadi Mandal. For the present I have shouldered the responsibility 
and loaned money from the Ashram. But you should not expect a public
institution to return what you have put in. You can ask a public body
to take up the responsibility of carrying on the work and insist that
henceforth that body should raise its own funds. If eventually it is
proposed to wind up the centre you should have the right of pre-
emption, and if you do not exercise it, you should be given your
share corresponding to your capital investment of Rs. 10,000. Your
condition of withdrawing your capital after two years is, I think,
not fair. I would not call it unfair if you want to fix a two-year
limit to your annual subsidies. But I certainly expect both of you to
continue your help to perpetuate the institution which you have
nurtured as your own, as long as it functions smoothly. And now that
you want to make your own business more paying, I think this centre
should particularly benefit from the gain; in fact I may demand this.
The Amreli Khadi Centre is the foremost institution of khadi work in
Kathiawar. There is much effort behind it, quite an amount has been
spent over it and the work can well be regarded as stabilized. There
can be no doubt about its utility. With the closure of this centre
khadi work in Kathiawar will suffer a major setback.</p>

The letter does credit to the correspondent, but her argument does
not solve the problem whether widows should have the freedom to
remarry. When a child-widow is totally ignorant of any dharma, how
can we expect her to understand the dharma of a widow? Living a life
of dharma implies an understanding of what dharma means. Can we say
that a child who simply does not understand the distinction between
right and wrong is guilty of a falsehood? A child-widow of nine years
does not understand the meaning of marriage, nor of widowhood. She
is, as far as she is concerned, unmarried. How, then, can we say that
she has become a widow? She was married by her parents, and it is
they who think that she has become a widow? If, therefore, the
widow’s life earns merit for anyone, it does so for the parents.
But can they really earn such merit at the sacrifice of a nine- year
old girl? Even if they can, the problem of the girl’s future is
still with us. Let us suppose that she has grown into a young woman
of twenty years. As she gradually came to understand things, she
realized from the attitude of the people round her that she was
regarded as a widow. But let us suppose she has not understood a
widow’s dharma, and also that, by the time she was twenty, the
natural impulses had grown in her and become strong. What should she
do now? She  cannot say anything to her parents, for they have
already decided that their daughter—a young woman now—was a widow
and that marriage was out of the question for her.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.3cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.03cm; line-height: 95%">
This is only an imaginary instance. But there are many Hindu widows
in the country, thousands of them, whom this description will fit. As
we have seen, they earn merit for none by living as widows. Whom
shall we hold responsible for the many sins into which these young
women fall in yielding to desire? According to  me,  their parents
certainly share in their sin; but the evil is a blot on Hinduism too,
the latter loses its vitality day by day, and immorality flourishes
in the nameof dharma. That is why, though I once held the same views
as this sister, I have reluctantly come to the conclusion, through</p>

experience, that a child-widow who, on growing up to womanhood, may
wish to marry, should have complete freedom, and  be encouraged to do
so; not only that, her parents should make every effort to get her

virtue.</p>

Even if, as suggested here, child-widows are remarried, pure
widowhood will continue to adorn Hinduism. If a woman who has known
conjugal love, on becoming a widow, deliberately refuses to marry
again, her self-control will not have been imposed on her from
outside. There is no power on earth which can tempt her to marry. Her
freedom is for ever safe.</p>

It is immoral to assume a spiritual union where there has been none.
Such a union simply cannot exist between a child-husband and a
child-wife. Savitri entered into a spiritual union, so did Sita and
Damayanti. We cannot even imagine such women, should they become
widows, ever marrying again. Ramabai Ranade lived such a pure life in
her widowhood. Today, Vasantidevi<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>lives in this manner. Their virtuous life as widows
ennobles the Hindu way of life, sanctifies it. Through the supposed
widowhood of girls who are only children, Hindu society sinks lower
day by day. Women who became widows after they had grown up into
womanhood should, while they continue to live worthily as widows,
come forward to help child-widows to remarry and to spread the reform
among the Hindus. Other women who share the views of this
correspondent should see their error in supposing that dharma can be
preserved by perpetuating  the misfortune of child-widows. I have
been led to this conclusion, not by my sympathy for sufferings of
child-widows, but by profounder considerations about dharma which
guide my heart in this matter; and  I have tried to explain them
here.</p>

That alone is true service which the world comes to know only through
its results. A man or a woman dedicated to service never desires
publicity for himself or herself. There are persons serving in this

girls. The latter does not mention their number. The classes in the
Seva Sadan and Congress House are attended mostly by Parsi girls, and
the one in Saraswat Hall by girls from Karnatak. Arrangements are now
being made to conduct a class in Bhuleshwar for Gujarati girls. If
such work is undertaken in other places too, how many more poor women

Shri Nagindas Amulakhrai published many years ago a book with this
title, with 13 parts and over 2,000 pages. He has arranged in it,
subject-wise, such of my writings as he could collect. I have looked
through one or two parts and I can get from them an idea of the
labour and care he has bestowed on the work. I think that the book
will be a help to those who attach some value to my writings. Shri
Nagindas did not want to make any profit, and has made none, by
publishing this book. A large number of copies still lie unsold with
him. The original price of the book was Rs. 8-10-0. He has now
reduced it to Rs. 4-10-0 for general readers. But he is ready to send
the book—all the 13 parts—to hostels, libraries, ashrams and such
other public institutions, as also to poor students, on their sending
Re. 1 for postage, Rs. 1-8-0 if in a foreign country. Those who would
like to have my writings in book form may write to Shri Nagindas
Amulakhrai at 6, Sukhadwala Building, Hornby Road, Fort, Bomaby-1.</p>

You have written to me about two friends. I do not know what can be
done for them just now. The Ashram is over-crowded at the present
moment and I almost fear it will remain so whilst I am here. I am
seriously thinking of putting up some more buildings and yet it is  a
matter for consideration whether it is worth while doing so if I am
to remain a fixture at the Ashram only during this year. What is the
use of building new rooms just for a temporary purpose? For
immediately  I am on the move, probably, the new-comers will go away.
Will the friends then wait for this year? I know it is a long time
but I do not [see] what else I can do. Do you suggest anything? I am

Now about the diet. We, food reformers, have a way of arguing
somewhat loosely. I do not think our observations about the <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
</font></sup>of salt on the system are really accurate or in any way
complete. Not that doctors are much better but there are scientists
amongst them who have undoubtedly made great researches and the
testimony in favour of salt as a necessary article of diet is
overwhelming. As it is not producing an evil effect on me, I do not
feel justified in revising the advice of those doctors for whom I
have very high regard.  The spiritual value of abstaining from salt
is undoubtedly great and on that account I do not feel inclined to
write anything to correct what I had written in my booklet on diet.
But as to its effect on the body, my view is shaken. If I was young,
I would enforce the desire, such as never thought out in me [<i>sic</i>]
to study medical science and then support the conclusions that we
hold through that science. That, however, must be</p>

The following<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1 </font></sup>is
a vivid description of a visit paid to some of the spinning centres
in Bihar by Sjt. Satish Chandra Das Gupta of Khadi Pratishthan. It
shows in the clearest manner possible what spinning is doing for the
humble folks of this greart land of ours. Millions of threads spun
are like so many rays of sunshine brought into the frigid and dark
dungeons miscalled homes of India. The title that Satish Babu has
chosen for his description well fits it. This raw product goes to
Manchester when our millions are ever crying “Give us cotton”.
Why? Deft fingers are ready to turn it into warmth-giving yarn for a
few coppers but find it difficult to procure it. Thousands of bales
of this beautiful stuff are being exported abroad in order to raise
the dividends of the huge multi-millionaires who are engaged in
exploiting the dumb millions of India. It is up to every lover of the
land, at least to see to it that he takes his full share in supplying
cotton to those whom Satish Babu has described. He can do it either
by controlling such depots himself or sending his own subscription to
the All India Spinners’ Association which will do it for him. And
he must be ready to make use of all the khaddar that can be woven out
of yarn so spun. He or she may add as many other activities as he or
she likes to this primary one.</p>

Dr. Malan’s proposal and its final acceptance by the Viceroy make
up a bitter cup of humiliation for the nation. The Union Government
has given a Select Committee that will take evidence on the principle
as well as the details of the Asiatic Bill. Dr. Malan has hedged it
in with four conditions: That the Paddison Deputation should be the
only party to give evidence before this Committee on behalf of the
Government of India; that there should be no other deputation, no
“agitator”—this is Dr. Malan’s own expression,—sent from
India to supplement that evidence; that the Select Committee should
report on or before the 1st of March and that the Bill should be
taken up for final disposal during the present session of the Union
Parliament.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 95%">
In my opinion, not one of these conditions could be accepted by a
free nation. The Paddison Deputation went only to collect facts, and
not to negotiate. A far more important deputation would have gone if
it had to negotiate and tender evidence. It is insulting to impose a
condition that no other deputation should proceed to South Africa. It
is still more insulting to insinuate that the Government of India
could ever send an agitator to South Africa. The patronizing language
used by Dr. Malan regarding the Paddison Deputation only adds injury
to insult. The condition that the Select Committee should report
before the 1st of March makes it hardly possible for the Government
of India or the Indian settlers to collect and marshal all the
evidence that can be tendered to show that the principle of the
measure is contrary to the settlement of 1914.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The announcement, side by side with that of the appointment of the
Select Committee, that the Bill is to be proceeded with during the
current session of the Union Parliament, shows that the Union
Government has made up its mind regarding what it intends to do and
that the appointment of the Select Committee is merely an eye-wash
designed to save the face of the Government of India  and  to
hoodwink the world into believing that the Union Government wishes to
do nothing unfair. From this so called concession of the Union
Government, therefore, I have no hope of any satisfaction for the
doomed settlers. That Government is conscious of its strength and is
bent on using all that strength against the settlers. It seems clear
that the Government of India will accept the finding of the Select
Committee and leave the settlers to their own fate. India in her
present state will probably be able to do nothing more than
registering another more strong, emphatic and unanimous protest
against the</p>

Though some of the questions put have been already answered in these

repetition. His first quesstion is:</p>

They have an immense moral value for me, but I do not regard
everything said in the Bible as the final word of God or exhaustive
or even acceptable from the moral standpoint. I regard Jesus Christ
as one of the greatest teachers of mankind, but I do not consider him
to be the “only son of God”. Many pasages in the Bible are
mystical. For me “the letter killeth, the spirit giveth life” The
second question is:</p>

I do not believe in caste as it is at present constituted, but I do
believe in the four fundamental divisions regulated according to the
four principal occupations. The existing innumerable divisions with
the attendant artificial restrictions and elaborate ceremonial  are
harmful to the growth of a religious spirit, as also to the social
well- being of the Hindus and therefore also their neighbours. The

nation. The only connection therefore with Britain that I would
desire and value is that of an absolutely free and equal partnership
at will. If, however, the connection is broken, India will naturally
have a system of democratic government suited to the genius of the
people. It will be shaped not according to one man’s wishes but to

My attitude towards the Indian States and their Rulers is that of
perfect friendship. I desire a radical reform in their constitution.
The condition in many States is most deplorable, but reform has to
come from within and it is a matter for adjustment between the Rulers

upon them by the expression of enlightened public opinion in their
neighbourhood. The fifth question is:</p>

My advice is: Having gone there live down the prejudice, but resist
unto life wherever it hurts your self-respect in any shape or form.
Hardships must be the lot of those who have to live in an uncongenial
atmosphere and who will still retain their self-respect. You are
certainly justified in writing about it anywhere so long as you do so
without bitterness and without exaggeration. It would be the most
proper thing to tell in a dignified manner the people of the United
States of the hardships whenever you get an opportunity. The ninth
question is:</p>

If you mean Indian students, my humble advice is: Express the best
that is in you in that far off foreign land, so that your lives may
be an example to your neighbours. Do not slavishly follow all that
you see in the West. And as you seem to be speaking on behalf of
Christian students, I feel tempted to quote from the Bible: “Seek
thee first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and everything
will be added unto you.”</p>

contemptuous opinion about Germans or Germany. Who can dare? Germans
are a great and brave people. Their industry,  their scholarship, and
their bravery command the admiration of the world. One hopes that
they will lead the peace movement. They  were  defeated in the last
War, not vanquished. All that is needed is a transmutation of their
marvellous energy for the promotion of the progress of the world as a
whole, rather than its application for their own as against that of
the whole world. There are signs of  that desirable change coming
over them as over the other peoples of the earth.</p>

	I have your letter. I am glad that the history of my life appeals to
	you and is helpful. I could endorse your opinion that these inner

	political activity in which I have found myself throughout my life.
	Such value as that activity possesses is derived from the inner
	experiences which I am endeavouring to recall and relate as
	accurately as it is possible for one to do. I am trying to bring out
	every weakness and to show also how the weakness was overcome.</p>

	I do hope that you will give more attention to your spinning than
	you seem to have done. As you are a scientist I need hardly draw
	your attention to the well-established experience of the world that
	whatever is worth doing, is worth doing as well as it is possible
	for us to do. Many of us who are spinning find it simple enough to
	spin 300 yards at least per hour provided the wheel is kept in order
	and the slivers are good. The highest speed attained is 900 yards
	per hour.</p>

	I have your letter. You have put me a most difficult question:
	Whether asking for Government recognition or financial assistance
	from the government for your institution is a moral sin or not is a
	question solely for you or the management to decide. For one whom
	there is no consciousness of sin in a matter of this character there
	is no sin. A stranger’s opinion therefore is of no value in
	determining the nature of the act proposed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.07cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
	For my own self, if I were you, I could not possibly ask for
	Government recognition or assistance. And, if thereby the students
	desert me, I should not feel sorry<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 6pt">1
	</font></sup>because of the consiousness of the rightness of my
	abstention. Whether your acceptance will be a political blunder or
	not is a question on which an outsider can give an opinion. In terms
	of the Congress resolutions and  the  present tendency of
	Congressmen in general, it will not be a political blunder. In the
	sense that an institution that has hitherto refused to bend before
	the storm might now feel impelled to bend, does really add to the
	already existing weakness. On the whole, however, you must regard my
	opinion as purely an academic opinion. You must  therefore decide
	according to the inner promptings of your conscience and nobody
	would have the right to point the finger of scorn if you decide to
	take Government assistance. You must fearlessly do what you consider
	to be right.</p>

I have your letter after many days. There has been no letter from
Devdas either for the last four or five days. We are already
convinced that you will need a long rest. Staying there, you may
occasionally do something which you can do without risking your
health. But give up the idea of Bombay altogether for the present.
Undoubtedly, since Devdas is not here, Mahadev has to work more. But
there is nothing remarkable in that. To serve only when it
isconvenient is not a mark of friendship. If Mahadev cannot go there,
he should face the inconvenience caused by Devdas’s absence. So far
as Devdas is concerned, he has nothing to lose if his stay there is
prolonged. Self-development lies in service.</p>

	Shri Devchandbhai Parekh, Sheth Devidas Ghevaria and some others
	have come here. In consultation with them we  have provisionally
	decided among ourselves that, if the State has no objection, the
	next year’s session of the [Kathiawar] Political Conference be
	held at Porbunder. The main difficulty in holding it there this year
	is that I cannot attend it on account of my resolve<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. And the gentlemen who have gathered here and myself
	are of the opinion that so long as the new form that the conference
	has adopted at its Bhavnagar session is not stabilized, my presence
	would prove helpful. I shall not hesitate to preside over the
	session if it helps the conference moving forward.</p>

	We have unanimously asked Sheth Devidas to accept the presidentship
	of the Reception Committee. First, the country is very much in need
	of workers. Sheth Devidas likes to work and also has faith in the
	wheel and khadi. This is why we chose him. Of course, under the
	rules the final decision rests with members of the Reception
	Committee. I have learnt from Devchandbhai that the Hon’ble
	Ranasaheb also has no objection to holding the session at Porbunder.
	All the same I shall be obliged if you will kindly ask the Hon’ble
	Ranasaheb to further clarify his attitude and let me know his views.</p>

I have your telegram as also your  letter. Doctor Naidoo telegraphs
to me emphatically denying that any violence was used by the
satyagrahis. On the contrary, he complains of violence on the part<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

by the so- called untouchables.</p>

	</font></sup>Shaffi’s letter. Please tell him and other Mohammedan
	friends that in my opinion it would be wrong for the Swarajists to
	support the tabled resolution about the N.W.F. Provinces. At the
	same time I should support any proposal to include these Provinces
	in any scheme of self-government that the Congress ultimately agrees
	to. To that end I have suggested to you two draft resolutions which
	I hope the Mussalman friends will accept. If no agreement can be
	reached I feel that your embargo upon voting by the Swarajist
	members is the only dignified course.</p>

The papers say that King George visited the Industrial Exhibition now
being held in England. There, in a section exhibiting
English-manufactured typewriters, he noticed a government employee
typing letters on an American typewriter. The King was angry at this
and asked why, if English-manufactured typewriters were in demand
outside England, they in England used American typewriters. The
officer-in-charge promised to inquire into the matter and tried to
pacify the King. But the latter would not be pacified and said that
he himself would inquire. The manufacturer of the English typewriter
stated that, if his typewriters were introduced in government offices
in England, he could certainly provide employment for one more person
for every typewriter bought. Commenting on the incident, British
newspapers say that, where the House of Commons has been helpless,
the King’s firmness and displeasure will have some effect.</p>

We may perhaps feel that England, which exports her goods to all
countries in the world, has no justification for resenting the use of
American typewriters. If, however, we look at the matter from the
King’s point of view, his displeasure will seem justified. It was
argued in defence that American typewriters were being used in
government offices because of their superior quality. But the King, a
shrewd man, saw that one should not reject a local product because a
foreign article</p>

is better. Maybe it is, but the right place for it is the country of
its manufacture. If we can, we may try to imitate it, but failing in
that we should be satisfied with what we can manufacture. This
argument must have immediately occurred to the King. Be that as it
may, there is much that we can, if we would, learn from this
incident. At the most a thousand American typewriters must be in
government offices [in England]. If they are replaced by English
manufactured typewriters, one thousand Britons could be employed as
claimed by the manufact- urer of the typewriters. In our country,
however, if we show the same shrewdness and patriotism as King George
did and are as much dis- pleased with ourselves, we could feed not
one thousand but crores of our starving countrymen. The thing with
which we can do this is khadi. If, without making any special effort
for the purpose, we effect some intelligent economy and start using
khadi, merely through this change every man and woman would save for
the country the equivalent of one person’s earnings for a month.
For, the average annual expenditure on cloth per head comes to Rs. 8,
out of which not less than Rs. 5 is the cost of labour. Crores in our
country do not get even that. The annual per capita income in India
is put at Rs. 30. This was the estimate 30 years ago. Having regard
to the rise in prices, the figure is put at Rs. 40 now. In that case,
the figure of annual expenditure [on cloth] must also be raised
correspondingly. There is no harm, therefore, in accepting the figure
of Rs. 30 even for calculations today. But no matter what figure we
accept, five rupees is certainly more than the average monthly
earnings of one person. For doing all this good and earning the moral
merit which accrues from it, people have only to change their ideas,
or even less than that, their taste. English or mill-made cloth,
pleasing to the eye and soft to the touch, will always be inferior to
the khadi woven by the poor from yarn spun by the poor.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.36cm; line-height: 102%">
The English word ‘education’ etymologically means ‘drawing
out’. That means an endeavour to develop our latent talents. The
same is the meaning of <i>kelavani, </i>the Gujarati word for
education. When we say that we develop a certain thing, it does not
mean that we change its kind or quality, but that we bring out the
qualities latent in it. Hence</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.13cm; page-break-before: always">
‘education‘ can also mean ‘unfoldment’.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
In this sense, we cannot look upon knowledge of the alphabet as
education This is true even if that knowledge gains us the M.A.
degree or enables us to adorn the place of a Shastri<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>in
some pathshala<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>with the requisite knowledge of Sanskrit. It may well be
that the highest literary knowledge is a fine instrument for
education or unfoldment, but it certainly does not itself constitute
education.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
True education is something different. Man is made of three
constituents, the body, mind and spirit. Of them, spirit is the one
permanent element in man. The body and the mind function on account
of it. Hence we can call that education which reveals the qualities
of spirit. That is why the seal of the Vidyapith carries the dictum
‘Education is that which leads to moksha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>’</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.27cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Education can also be understood in another sense; that is, whatever
leads to a full or maximum development of all the three, the body,
mind and spirit, may also be called education. The knowledge that is
being imparted today may possibly develop the mind a little, but
certainly it does not develop the body and spirit. I have a doubt
about the development of the mind too, because it does not mean that
the mind has developed if we have filled it with a lot of
information. We cannot therefore say that we have educated our mind.
A well- educated mind serves man in the desired manner. Our literate
mind of today pulls us hither and thither. That is what a wild horse
does. Only when a wild horse is broken in can we call it a trained
horse. How many ‘educated’ young men of today are so trained?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Now let us examine our body. Are we supposed to cultivate the body by
playing tennis, football or cricket for an hour every day? It does,
certainly, build up the body. Like a wild horse, however, the body
will be strong but not trained. A trained body is healthy, vigorous
and sinewy. The hands and feet can do any desired work. A pickaxe, a
shovel, a hammer, etc., are like ornaments to a trained hand and it
can wield them. That hand can ply the spinning-wheel well as also the
ring and the comb while the feet work a loom. A well trained body
does not get tired in trudging 30 miles. It can scale mountains
without getting breathless. Does the student acquire such physical
culture? We can assert that modern curricula do not impart physical
education in this sense.</p>

The less said about the spirit the better. Only a seer or a seeker
can enlighten the soul. Who will awaken that dormant spiritual energy
in us all? Teachers can be had through an advertisement. Is there a
column for spiritual quest in the testimonials which they have to
produce? Even if there is one, what is its value? How can we get
through advertisements teachers who are seekers after
self-realization? And education without such enlightenment is like a
wall without a foundation or, to employ an English saying, like a
whited sepulchre. Inside it there is only a corpse eaten up or being
eaten by insects.</p>

shown that you do not consider this an ordinary wedding. Among Hindus
there is a great deal of ostentation at weddings. There is singing,
dancing, feasting and a variety of other diversions. The spiritual
element, which indeed makes the ceremony meaningful, gets lost sight
of. Money is spent on such a scale that, for poor people, getting
married has become an arduous business. Many incur debts which they
are unable to pay up in their lifetime. To expect that such marriages
will enable the bride and the bridegroom to tread the path of dharma
is mere wishful thinking. It is not easy to lead a life of self
control after a ceremony in which there is so much pomp and so much
evil which the parents on either side do all they can to foster. The
ideal of this Ashram is the practice of <i>brahmacharya </i>even by
married couples and some of us do follow this ideal. The children are
also given instruction in <i>brahmacharya. </i>And yet a marriage
takes place at the Ashram and under its auspices. Why? Well, we were
faced</p>

with a moral dilemma and this is what we did. Those who follow ahimsa
use force against no one. Those among the Ashram inmates who cannot
practise <i>brahmacharya </i>must therefore marry as a matter of
duty. And why should we not bless them while do this duty? And why
should we not, again, introduce an improved ritual? Indeed it is our
duty to do so. When I reflected on the matter it was clear to me that
all over India, indeed all over the world, the ritual of marriage
includes an element of self-control. Marriage is not intended for
satisfying lust. It is laid down in the <i>smritis </i>that couples
who exercise self-control live in <i>brahmacharya. </i>I myself did
not understand this for a long time. But after a great deal of
thought I was able to grasp the truth of it. Those who cannot
entirely destroy passion can at least keep it in check by leading a
life of self-control. You all know my standing with Jamnalalji. We
both decided that we should have this wedding performed in the
simplest manner possible and at the least expense, and the ritual
should be such as to impress upon both the young people the real
meaning of marriage. It is not easy effectively to dispense with
pomp, feasting and singing and dancing in  a  marriage ceremony. If
wedding were to take place  in  Bombay  it would be a lesson go the
Marwari community  and  Jamnalalji’s friends. It would help destroy
the <i>adharma </i>that passes for reforms. It would be an example of
what real dharma consists in. But I was afraid it might not be
possible to have the ceremony performed as simply in Bombay as here.
I shall not go into my reasons for that fear. So I rejected Wardha as
well as Bombay as the venue. Then how to see the thing through? The
wishes of Jamnalalji and his parents would not be enough. It was
necessary also to consult RameshwarPrasad’s people. God was,
however, kind and Keshavdevji also agreed. The Marwari community has
a lot of money and they spend it lavishly. So much, in fact, that the
poorer sections find weddings a great strain and burden. There are
floral decorations, feasting, lighting and dancing by professional
dancers. I am not sure whether there is such dancing among the
Marwaris but in Gujarat this is so among certain wealthy people. It
has its effect on the Marwaris and on the entire Hindu society of
which they are a part and even on Muslims and other communities. I
concede that the effect on these latter communities is somewhat less.
So you can imagine under what a great burden the rich have to labour.
Of course, I have nothing to say about those among the rich who are
solely given to amassing wealth and have, in their pride, forgotten
God. The Marwaris have in spite of some prevalent</p>

corrupt practices, they love dharma. I know this only too well. Every
year they spend lacs of rupees for the sake of dharma. This too I
know from experience. So we both decided that the  marriage ceremony
should take place in the simplest manner possible. It is thus we 
could   meet   the   demands   of   both   swartha<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
     </font></sup>and   <i>paramartha</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>. <i>Swartha </i>consisted in thinking of the good  of
Jamnalalji and Keshavdevji, Rameshwar Prasad and Kamla, while
<i>paramartha </i>lay in showing a path to others. There will be no
singing and dancing. Only the barest ritual as sanctioned by
religious usage will take place. You friends have been invited so
that you will witness the ceremony, approve of it and pledge
yourselves to follow the example. Maybe I am here mistaken and you
may perhaps not like to follow  this example. The few rich men who
live in India do not make it a rich country. It is the country of the
poor. In no other country in the world do so many people die of
starvation or become diseased and dehumanized by perpetual hunger. 
In saying this I repeat the statements of historians, not Hindu or
Muslim historians but historians belonging to the governing race.
Even the millionaires of such a poor country have not the right to do
a thing that would hurt the stomach of the poor. After all, the rich
earn their wealth in India; they do not bring it from outside the
country—though even then it would be sin to earn money through
inflicting misery upon people in foreign countries. The millionaires
and multi-millionaires living in India only make the poor poorer.
There are seven lakh villages in India. Many of them are being slowly
destroyed. Their blood is being sucked. The result is that many who
cannot manage to get even one meal a day die of starvation. Human
beings as well as cattle starve to death in this country. In the
circumstances the rich must spend on themselves only as much money as
is absolutely necessary according to dharma. The rest should be spent
on the welfare of others, to the benefit of both the poor and the
rich. If we view this wedding from this angle, it is an event worth
emulating. It is no ordinary reform. Its roots go deep. Its result
will also be good. If a poor man acts in this manner he can of course
do so without effort but it will not have the same effect. Jamnalalji
could have thrown away ten, twenty, even fifty thousand rupees. His
fellow Marwaris would only have praised the splendour of the wedding.
But though he had the money, he did not spend it. He</p>

gave up his right. The result of this is bound to be good. It is said
in the <i>Gita </i>that what great men do others also do. It is a
valid and proven dictum. I am obliged to you all and I again thank
you. You will give your blessings to Rameshwar Prasad and Kamla. It
will be good if others follow this example. If they do, it will be
service to dharma and the country. I know both Rameshwar Prasad and
Kamla are here. They both have mature understanding. Rameshwar Prasad
certainly has it and Kamla too has reached the age when she is
treated as a friend by her parents. They will both realize that with
all the trouble that their parents have taken, with all the trouble
all these people have taken to come here and witness this wedding, it
is not to be taken as a licence for satisfying their lust. They must
not become slaves to passion. All this is being done so that they may
become an ideal couple, may dedicate themselves to a higher ideal.
Even in <i>grihasthashrama </i>there is scope for conquering passion.
Shastras of course say that union is permitted only when progeny is
desired. We have forgotten this; and no one has reminded us of it. I
wish to make it clear to Rameshwar Prasad that the wife is not the
slave of the husband. She is his better half. She must be treated as
a friend. Rameshwar Prasad must never even in his dream consider
Kamla as a slave. Among Hindus there still are people who treat their
wives as their property. These two young persons are entering a new
life. I have said on a former occasion that marriage is a second
birth. May this couple reach the ideal of Shiva-Parvati,
Savitri-Satyavan and Sita- Rama. Hinduism gives such a high place to
women that we say Sita- Rama not Rama-Sita; we say Radha-Krishna not
Krishna-Radha. But for Sita no one would know Rama. No one would have
heard the name of Satyavan if there had been no Savitri. The Pandavas
would have remained unknown if there had been no Draupadi. We need
not search for examples. I am sure that this event will bear good
fruit, and I will have no occasion to regret my part in it. I have
still some years to live and I would walk in fear of God. Whatever I
do, I do after consulting my inner being. My inner being says that
this will be an ideal couple and will give us no cause to repent. I
now bless them both and wish them a long life. May they bring credit
to their elders and may they support dharma and serve the country.</p>

I sent you a telegram yesterday saying that it was not possible for
me to give you a decision regarding the delegation to the

All my views about what the A.I.C.C. should do at the present moment
have been clearly put before Panditji. I do not therefore reiterate
them here. Technically the delegation may not be coverd by the
Congress resolution, but if you vacate your seats in the Councils, it
seems to me to be hardly dignified to accept the delegation or any
such nominations to Committees or Conferences in which the Government
may be concerned. How nice it would have been, if you could possibly
have come whilst Panditji was here!</p>

I am destroying your letter. Do please come even now whenever you get
the time, but give yourself at least 2 or 3 days so that we might
talk at leisure. And whether you go to the Labour Conference or not,
it would certainly be nice if you had a voyage and rest in some quiet
place pleasing to you. I do not find much in your idea of combining
political work with rest and, as I do, you  will  throw yourself in
the work and have no rest. If you go at all therefore there should be
a sacred resolution extorted from you that you will not do any
political work at all but merely rest and be thankful.</p>

Deolali is not adequate for summer. So you must now get ready to go

is of course prepared to stay on there till you recover. He himself
does not think that his progress will be stopped by doing that.  I
have never believed that anybody’s progress can be stopped by his
doing work of service. Studies, etc., are not ends but means, while
service is an end in itself. No man has so far found his salvation
through studies. Many have found, and are finding, their salvation
through service. It is of course difficult to realize this and having
realized it, to act on it. But then it is never easy to achieve

Owing to the repeated requests of young friends under 18 years to
become members of the All-India Spinners’ Association, the Council
has passed a resolution, at its last meeting, permitting boys and
girls under 18 years who are habitual wearers of khaddar to become
members upon sending 1,000 yards per month of their own spinning. The
idea is to encourage boys and girls to cultivate regularity, and to
establish a moral bond between themselves and the poorest in the
land. And this inestimable advantage is gained apart from the art of
spinning being a training for the eye and fingers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
Youths who wish to become members will be expected to spin daily for
at least half an hour and if they will set apart a parcticular
half-hour for the purpose, they will find that it will induce a
regularity in all other studies and work that they may undertake.
They will be expected to keep their wheels in perfect order, learn to
repair them and learn also the art of carding and making their own
slivers. All these processes take up very little time, that is, for
those who love their work.For schoolboys and girls, I recommend not
the spinning-wheel but the <i>takli. </i>It has been ascertained that
the <i>takli </i>enables one easily to</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 102%; page-break-before: always">
spin 80 yards per hour. Spinning on the <i>takli </i>at the rate of
half an hour daily gives one the required monthly subscription  of
1,000 yards.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
I hope therefore that many boys and girls will register them- selves
as members, subject to the permission of their parents or guardians.
So far schools are concerned, it will be saving of postage if
schoolmasters will take charge of the yarn that may be spun and make
one parcel taking care to attach cards to the quantity spun by each
boy or girl. The parcels should be addressed  to  the  Director,
Technical Department of the All-India Spinners’ Association,
Satyagraha Ashram, Sabarmati.</p>

Juveniles or their guardians at the time of sending self-spun yarn
should note the name, age, sex and address of the spinner, give also
the number of yards and state that the spinner habitually wears

The Director of the Technical Department of the All-India Spinners’
Association writes that members have been repeatedly writing for the
return of their yarn for converting into khaddar for their personal
use and offering to pay any reasonable price. The Secretary undertook
to convert it into khadi and let them have it, provided that they did
not mind the mixing of other hand-spun yarn if their own was not
sufficient. But this proposal to mix it was not acceptable to the
members inasmuch as they wanted the satisfaction of wearing clothes
made out of yarn spun by themselves. It has not been possible to
comply with the desire of the members, laudable though it is in many
respects, because of the possibility of some returning the same yarn
as subscription. For, it would not be possible for the Association to
pick and choose, favour some members and condemn others. A way has
therefore been now discovered of selling the yarn received to the
subscribers by doing so after bleaching it. Bleaching will in no way
damage the yarn. It will whiten it, and if anything make it a trifle
stronger.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
Those, therefore, who want their yarn back against payment can have
it on application to the Director, Technical Department, or the
Secretary of the All-India Spinners’ Association. And those members
who desire the return of their yarn will please take care to mark on
the cards attached to their yarn in clear words “to be returned”.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.07cm">The
department will not be able to send the yarn by V.P. post. I</p>

therefore suggest, in order to avoid delay, that the senders deposit
with the Director Rs. 5 when yarn will be returned immediately upon
entry and examination and bleaching, unless the senders  desire  that
sufficient quantity should be collected before the yarn is retuned.</p>

some literature evenat the Yeravda prison by well-meaning
missionaries, which seemed to be written as if merely to belittle
Hinduism. About beef-eating and wine-drinking at baptism I have
merely stated what I heard and I have said as much in my writing. And
whilst I accept Mr. Scott’s repudiation I must say that though I
have mixed freely among thousands of Christian Indians, I know very
few who have scruples about eating beef or other flesh meats and
drinking intoxicating liquors. When I have gently reasoned with them,
they have quoted to me the celebrated verse “Call thou nothing
unclean” as if it referred to eating and gave a licence for
indulgence.  I know that many Hindus eat meat, some eat even beef and
drink wines. They are not converts. Converts are those who  are 
“born again” or should be. A higher standard is expected of those
who change their faith, if the change is a matter of the heart and
not of convenience. But I must not enter into deeper waters. It is a
matter of pleasure to me to be able to say that if I have had painful
experiences of Christians and Christian missionaries I have pleasant
ones also  which I treasure. There is no doubt that among them the
spirit of toleration is growing. Among individuals there is also a
deeper study of Hinduism and other faiths and an appreciation of
their beauties, and among some even an admission that the other great
faiths of the world are not false. One is thankful for the growing
liberal spirit but I have the conviction that much still remains to
be done  in  that direction.</p>

I have omitted from the letter the facts related by Satis Babu
regarding the eagerness of the spinners to get their portion of
cotton. Rajendra Babu adds that the majority of the spinners are
Mussalman women. I wish he had given the number of the spinners among
whom over Rs. 600 are being distributed weekly. But there is little
difficulty in discovering the number as the average earning per week
from the use of spare hours cannot be more than eight annas.
Therefore at least 1,200 needy women are being served in only three
centres. There are</p>

to my knowledge hundreds of such centres which can be opened if we
have men and money. Unfortunately there is a dearth of both and more
of men than of money. By judicious begging, money can be collected,
but not equally easily workers of the right sort. But the facts that
are being daily collected show that it is merely a question of time
when hand-spinning must become universal. During the transition stage
we must concentrate upon the centres that are already working and
make them self-supporting and permanent by effective organization.
The cry for cotton must be satisfied. And that can only be done by
moneyed men coming out with donations in cash or kind. The All-India
Deshbandhu Memorial is not being responded to, as it should, largely
because collecting has been suspended. I  hope however the
information that Sjts. Rajagopalachari and Rajendra Babu have made
available to us will be sufficient incentive to those who believe in
the potency of the spinning-wheel to loosen their purse strings. To
donate to the wheel is in my opinion an ideal form of charity, for it
helps the poor without making them beggars and idlers and without
robbing them of self-respect and at the same time is calculated to
make India self-supporting in the matter of clothing and to save her
the annual drain of nearly sixty crores of rupees.</p>

however sent me literature about the work of this society and asks me
to review it in the hope that the readers of <i>Young India </i>might
help the institution which has an annual income of nearly 2 lakhs but</p>

It has eight branches conducting 94 classes in which 1,234 girls and
women drawn from all classes receive instruction. 48 is the
percentage of widows attending these classes. It is interesting to
note that there are 3 women belonging to the suppressed class. There
are 8 Jews, 24 Christians and 7 Mohammedans. The percentage of non-
Brahmins is 40. There are 270 women residing in the 13 hostels
maintained by the society. There are 92  receiving  nursing  and
medical education. It has turned out already 125 certified teachers,
42 fully qualified nurses, 31 midwives, 19 doctors, 17 matrons and
governesses, 30 craft-mistresses and 9 music teachers. The
institution is ever growing. It is the largest of its kind in India.</p>

For an institution that caters for the needs of poor women it
certainly lacks one thing: hand-spinning and use of khaddar. But
there probably Sjt. Devadhar does not see eye to eye with me. I can
bide my time, for time always runs with the poor who have or have to
have inexhaustible patience, and since the General Secretary’s
heart is with the poor, he will not fail one day to recognize that if
his hand of fellowship is to reach out to the poorest in the land, it
will do so only through hand-spun yarn. To look at, it is a flimsy
cotton thread but it is stout enough to bind all the millions of
India together in its gentle and loving coil. No doubt,
embroidery-work and such other things taught at the Seva Sadan are
more paying than spinning but surely everything need not be reduced
into rupees, annas, pies. The 1,234 girls and women can be induced to
give to their less fortunate fellow- sisters half an hour of their
time every day and they can well afford to wear and carry the weight
of somewhat heavier khadi saris when they have the knowledge that
these saris have helped to fill the hungry mouths of some of their
unfortunate sisters.</p>

The <i>Forward </i>of Calcutta has rendered a public service by
publishing extracts from the Report of the Indian Jail Committee of
1919-20 being the evidence given by Lt. Colonel Mulvany on the
treatment of State prisoners. It brings vividly to light the evil of
the present system of Government in all its nakedness. It shows how
the officials themselves are coached to do the wrong thing and thus
corrupted and deprived of any sense of self-respect. Lt. Colonel
Mulvany was Superintendent of the Alipore Central Jail at the time. I

Upon the receipt of this letter Lt. Colonel Mulvany regretfully
pocketed his pride and sent what he knew to be an untruthful report.
How is it possible after this report to believe any at all coming
from a Government source and intended to whitewash it? Nor is this an
exceptional case. This cooking of reports and statements is a most
usual thing with the Government as is known to everyone who has had
anything to do with Government departments. Today everything has to
be “edited” by superior officers.</p>

Relatives of the brave men of Bengal who are being indefinitely
detained without a trial have with difficulty come to know certain
things about the prisoners, which have been given to the world and
which go to show that they are being put to much unnecessary
hardship. The allegations are generally denied and  where  a  total
denial is not possible, partial truth is admitted and the blame for
what suffering is admitted is thrown on the prisoners.</p>

When Sjt. Goswami succeeds in forcing a debate in  the Assembly he is
laughed at and told from the Government benches that Lt. Colonel
Mulvany’s statement was not accepted by the Committee. The
Government entrenching itself behind a wall of lies and the force of
its bayonets treats the complaints with contempt in the certain
belief that the detention and ill-treatment of prisoners are
necessary for the safety of the Englishmen it represents.</p>

Bengal has declared a day of hartal by way of protest. The Government
cares little about hartals of impotent people. It listens to no
argument save that of force, whether of the sword or the soul. It
knows and respects the former, it does not know the latter and
therefore fears it. We have not the former. We thought we had the
latter in 1921. But now—?</p>

	Maganlal has passed on your message to me. If an expert can be
	posted in Poona, he will be sent but I want to controvert your
	argument. We are not like Dunlops or Singers. We have not an
	unlimited capital to lose. We may not exploit in the sense that they
	do. We may not add thousand per cent to the cost at the base.  Our 
	methods therefore must be different from theirs. If we concentrate
	upon a central factory for turning out wheels and their parts, the
	movement is doomed to fail. On the contrary we must make the  people
	self-reliant and therefore teach them to make their own wheels. This
	teaching of decentralization can only commence with  the province
	and therefore you have to do what you are expecting Sabarmati to do,
	that is, the Central Board.</p>

	Maharashtra must train experts who will spread themselves in
	different parts and in their turn whilst helping the people will
	teach them. Those who believe in the wheel must not be  satisfied 
	with merely spinning yarn but must understand the mechanism of  the
	wheel themselves, to be able to mend it, to replace parts, learn all
	the easy methods of making and adjusting holders, spindle, outfit,
	etc. What is in its nature easy we must not make difficult by
	telling people that they need to come to us for putting their wheels
	right when they get out of order. I therefore suggest to you that
	you now begin to make an effort to become self-reliant and self
	contained, getting from</p>

stage in the career of khadi when it can go forward in leaps and
bounds if only the few workers that we are would make ourselves
experts in all its various branches—a consummation which really
does not require either much time or extraordinary intelligence or

I have received your letter. Devdas must have reached there. I am
likely to go to Sinhgadh in the first week of April. But please do
not think of coming to Kalyan. You will have reached Panchgani by the
time I go to Sinhgadh itself? This is worth giving thought to. Dr.
Jivraj has not chosen Sinhgadh for you because it is not possible to
stay here long. And he thinks that going there for a short visit
would involve a lot of strain. But where is the strain if you go up
in a litter? Nevertheless, think about it when I go to Sinhgardh.
Dilip will have fully recovered.</p>

	Yes. I am taking rest for one year at the Ashram. It is not possible

	I do not subscribe to the proposition that you seem to imply that
	good things require a library to explain them or that one needs
	numberless libraries to describe one’s joy and satisfaction. On
	the contrary, I have known that where reasons are sound and pious
	they can be summed up in a few lines and joy which is real is either
	inexpressible or its expression often condensed in one word or a
	phrase. I would therefore still ask you, if you care to explain, the
	reasons that have led you to Catholicism and describe if you can the
	secret of the endless joy it has given you. I ask this question not
	for idle curiosity but in order to understand the meaning and the
	power of Roman Catholicism. I understand somewhat but sufficiently</p>

Protestantism; I understand Islam; I understand also Hinduism but
though I had a few Roman Catholic friends, I have never been able to
come near enough to them to understand Catholicism. The superficial
distinctions between the two churches I do understand. What I want to

I have your letter. I understand about Dilip. I have  an impression
that there is a Hindu Sanatorium at Panchgani. You must write to
Tairsee<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2  </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">
</font></sup>and find out. Later even if there is no occasion to go
there the information gathered will not be in vain. I am not
personally fond of Panchgani. I would consider Deolali adequate. But
right now we are under Dr. Mehta. Therefore, it would be proper to
follow his instructions. If you have a quick recovery, it will be a
relief.</p>

I have your letter. Devdas, too, had paid a visit. According to the
size of your body, your weight should not be less than 120 pounds.
But as far as I am concerned, I do not lay emphasis on weight. You
should have a well-built body. I had tried grape-seeds. I do not know
whether they have any purgative value. I do not even know whether
they have been analysed. However, powder of the seeds might be having
the wave effect as sand. That is to say if a man takes two to four
grains of sand, his intestines develop a kind of irritation because
of which irritation, he passes stools. But this remedy should not be
tried regularly. It might be effective if tried occasionally. But it
will</p>

definitely harm those who have delicate intestines. So, I do not
recommend grape-seeds for you. You may try them  if Kuvalayanandji
knows of their analysis and if he knows from his personal experience
of their having a light purgative value, and advises you to take
them. But do tell him what I have written to you about the seeds.
Tell him also that I feel they are best discarded if you can pass
stools without them. Even after reading this, if he insists on your
taking the seeds, try them by chewing them well. You will know their
effect within two or three days. Beetroot contains a kind of sugar
and, therefore, to some extent it is healthy. It has a purgative
value too. Beetroot has to be boiled well. It is a false notion that
the vegetables and fruits which are red in colour have rajoguna.
Onions inspite of being pure white definitely have rajoguna.
Tomatoes, melons, red grapes, in spite of being red are satvik. If
those who practise yoga hold contrary views, I would like to know the
reasons.</p>

What is said about millet could possibly be true. The bad qualities
it has are not due to its colour but due to certain substances it
contains and the lack of certain others. A person who does not have
sufficient physical exercise and has to do a lot of mental work, is
not able to digest it. For that reason, it is considered to have
rajoguna and wheat is said to be satvik.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 95%">
Milk in comparison to meat is satvik. Compared to fruit, etc., it
certainly has rajoguna. But do not go into such details. For you at
the moment, milk, wheat, fruit and green vegetables are the things
worth taking.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 1.27cm; margin-top: 0.08cm; line-height: 102%">
Do not hesitate to ask me any question you feel the need to ask.
Sooner or later, I will certainly answer them. The best service you
can render is to make yourself fit so that I can take any work I like
from you. Improving health means achieving equilibrium of body, mind
and spirit. If you feel like rendering more service, propagate khadi
whenever you get an occasion. Persuade the non-wearers to wear it.
Whenever it becomes necessary, do argue in its favour without getting
excited. Do this work only if you can do it as fun. There is no need
to ride two horses at a time. It is enough if you pay attention to
your health. Though no community prayer is held there, you could drag
along some worthy friends for the prayer. I am sure there is no
difficulty in holding joint prayer.</p>

Though the Satyagraha Ashram has kept before itself the ideal of
inviolate celibacy, it recently celebrated some marriages; the events
being of general interest, I have commented on them in <i>Navajivan</i>.
I have discussed privately among friends how the Ashram which has
accepted celibacy as its ideal can thus encourage marriages. However,
a brief reply to the question for the benefit of readers  who  take
interest in the activities of the Ashram will not be out of place.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; line-height: 102%">
If those who aspire to follow the ideal  of <i>brahmacharya </i>accepted
by the Satyagraha Ashram cannot even bear to see  a  wedding, I
think, they will never be able to practise <i>brahmacharya </i>for
their whole life. We all know the story of Rishyashrung<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">

long. He should, on the countrary, be ready to battle with the
temptations which may occasionally face him. He whose mind wavers is
no <i>brahmachari</i>; only that self-restraint which is exercised of
one’s own free will can endure. This is what Nishkulanand had in
mind when he wrote in his poem: “Renunciation cannot last without
detachment”. One who feels joy in self-restraint and loves it will
not be tempted by things which might violate his vow of
self-restraint, but will remain indifferent to them.</p>

Moreover, there are boys and girls in the Satyagraha Ashram and it
cannot attempt to keep them unmarried against their will. It
naturally becomes the Ashram’s duty to help them to marry when they
feel that they will not be able to observe <i>brahmacharya </i>throughout
their lives. Moreover, the Ashram has a few well-wishers and its
inmates feel bound to help in any way they can to make the weddings
of these friends’ sons and daughters model celebrations. It has
been my view that, though arranged under the auspices of the Ashram,
such weddings are not likely to harm its ideal of <i>brahmacharya</i>.
Hence, instead of forbidding I have actually encouraged the Ashram to
arrange them under its auspices. One such wedding of a girl brought
up in the Ashram itself took place recently. Readers of <i>Navajivan
</i>know Shri Lakshmidas Purushottam. His eldest daughter, Chi. Moti,
was married about a month ago to Shri Najuklal Chokshi, a worker in
the Broach Kelavani Mandal. The marriage was arranged without any
stipulation of gifts from either side. I have been told that such
marriages are rare in the Bhatia community. We may add that the
marriage was the result of free choice by the bride and the
bridegroom, for though the initiative was taken by the bride’s
parents the final decision was made by the parties themselves. The
wedding was arranged only when both of them felt that they wished to
be joined in holy wedlock. None except close friends were invited to
the ceremony, either as guests in the party of the bride or the
bridegroom or in any other capacity. The couple wore their usual
khadi dress. They had, on their own, decided not to wear ornaments.
Both of them kept a fast till the ceremony of joining their hands in
marriage. The wedding cermony included nothing besides what was laid
down in the ancient Shastras. The bridegroom had sent no gifts for
the bride, for the latter’s parents did not want any to be sent.
Weddings like this where neither side is put to the expense of even
five rupees and the occasion is regarded as an opportunity for the
exercise of self-restraint are very rare in the country.</p>

A marriage celebrated in this manner cannot be considered a licence
for self-indulgence. The couple’s married life will be a course of
self-restraint, just as <i>brahmacharya </i>is. I know that
expenditure on marriages among Bhatias is increasing day by day,
since  the community has plenty of money. The bride is, so to say, a
commodity offered in sale, and this is done shamelessly since the 
practice  is almost universal among them. A poor Bhatia, therefore,
finds it extremely difficult to get a bride. I have given such
publicity to this event in the hope that religious-minded Bhatia
families will follow the example of the wedding here described.</p>

Another wedding, of the same kind as the one described above if not
exactly like it, was celebrated under the auspices of the Ashram on
Sunday last. The parties were members of the Marwari community. Shri
Jamnalal Bajaj gave in marriage his eldest daughter, Chi. Kamla, to
Chi. Rameshwar Prasad, son of the late Shri Kanaiyalalji. Shri
Rameshwar Prasad is studying in the Gujarat Vidyapith. The families
of both the parties being rich, it was extremely difficult for them
to have only the religious rites for the wedding and nothing else. I
have not heard of any wedding among rich Marwari families celebrated
with such simplicity. Ordinarily, the wedding would have  been
arranged at Wardha or in Bombay. Shri Jamnalalji wanted it to be
solemnized without ostentation and with the minimum of expenditure,
and wished at the same time that the ceremony should bring home to
the brideand the bridegroom the significance of marriage, its
essentially religious character, and also clearly explain to them
their mutual obligations. Shri Jamnalalji and I felt that such a
wedding could be celebrated only in the precincts of the Ashram. This
religious reform, however, could not be carried out without  the 
consent of the bridegroom and his family. But Shri Ramavallabhji and
Shri Keshavdevji won over Shri Rameshwar Prasad’s mother and other
elders, and thus secured the consent of all.</p>

For this wedding too, only the closest friends were invited. The
usual invitation cards were not distributed. The dinner was also cut
out. The custom of token gifts to the bride and the bride-groom was
not followed. There was absolutely nothing besides the religious

were dressed in khadi. At both weddings, the bridegroom and the bride

	I enclose herewith a copy of cable received from Johannesburg. I
	telegraphed the substance to Sorabji but I thought you should have
	the full text. I have replied ‘Await decision Committee, Delhi’.
	This reply I have sent in continuation of my assurance to Sorabji
	that I shall not give any advice to the settlers in South Africa
	contrary to what the Committee that seems to have been formed there
	may say or do. My own opinion however remains unchanged that we are
	being ourselves in the wrong by absolutely refusing to give evidence
	even on the principle of the Bill. I have heard the objection namely
	that our people will not be able to stand the fire of
	cross-examination and that there is no Indian of sufficient calibre
	and experience in South Africa who can give evidence. The obvious
	answer is that no Indian need give evidence. As you will see the
	Select Committee has asked for a written representation which can be
	prepared and the Solicitor who may be engaged on our behalf may
	submit himself for cross examination. I know the difficulty of
	selecting such a Solicitor or Counsel, but it is not an impossible
	task. Adam Alexander would not make a bad representative. He is a
	fairly conscientious man and his sympathies are with us. It is
	possible to think of others who can also give evidence without
	compromising or selling the community. What I want to say is that
	though nothing may come out of the Select Committee, we should not
	leave it open to them to say that although we were given the
	opportunity we did not even lead evidence. Let it not be said that
	in 1914 I boycotted the Solomon Commission. I did so for the simple
	reason that the community had taken the solemn resolution that if
	the Government did not widen the terms of the Commission and appoint
	a representative on behalf of the community on the Commission it
	would be boycotted. Hence the adherence to the resolution. Even so
	it could be recalled that before even the Commission sat, I had come
	to an understanding with General Smuts that the Asiatic Act would be
	repealed and that General Smuts would require from the Commission a
	finding that would enable him to offer us an honourable settlement.
	This is a matter of partly of record [<i>sic</i>].</p>

The reader will like to share with me the following letter from
Charlie Andrews, that noble-hearted Englishman who fights  our
battles whether in or outside India with a selflessness and devotion
difficult to equal, impossible to surpass, often in the midst of
misunderstanding. We shall probably never know what solace and
strength his presence has meant to our countrymen in South Africa, in
their hour of need. Here is his letter dated Cape Town, 23rd
February, without the alteration or removal of a single word:<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

I had two very long talks,—one with General Hertzog and one with
Malan, both of them extremely earnest and as I felt sincere. It even

there would be at least a long postponement. . . .</font></font></p>

I do not share Mr. Andrews’ gloomy forecast, not that I believe in
the Imperial Government or the Government of India doing anything
heroic. But I believe in the ultimate triumph of truth when it is
embodied in brave souls and in the ability and willingness of Indian
settlers to render a good account of themselves when the supreme
moment comes. They have but to be prepared for voluntary and
ennobling suffering in order to win. Compulsory and degrading
suffering is provided for them in the laws against which they are
fighting. Theirs is the choice.</p>

Another case like the one discussed in these pages recently has been
decided in the South with reference to the vexed question of
temple-entry by the so-called untouchables. One Murugesan, a Mala by
caste, was tried before the Stationary Sub-Magistrate of Tirupathi
for having ventured to enter a temple at Tiruchanur for the purpose
of offering worship. The Lower Court regarded this entry as
‘defilement with intent to insult the religion of a class’ under
section 295 of I.P.C. and fined the accused Rs. 75 or in default
rigorous imprisonment for one month. Fortunately for the poor
outcaste there were reformers who were interested in him. The case
went in appeal. The appellate court sustained the appeal. I quote the
following from the judgment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">In
the Lower Court 7 witnesses were examined for the prosecution. It is
shown by their evidence that the appellant is a Mala by caste, that
Malas are not allowed to enter the temple and that the entry of Malas
into the temple is considered a defilement of it. It is shown also
that appellant went into the temple to the </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><i>garbagudi
</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">where caste Hindus
alone may enter. He was then dressed properly and wearing marks of
piety; the Archaka taking him for a caste Hindu, received his
offering of cocoanuts and performed camphor </font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><i>harathi
</i></font><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">for him, for which
service appellant paid the prescribed fee of four annas. After
appellant departed the temple authorities found that he was a Mala
and as the place of worship was considered defiled by his presence it
became necessary to perform a purificatory ceremony.</font></font></p>

Again the prosecutors, the judges and the deliverers of the poor
despised men were his co-religionists—Hindus. Again the accused was
happily saved from rigorous imprisonment (he could not pay the
exorbitant fine I presume). But again the cause remains undecided. It
was open to the Hindu judge to say that the entry into a Hindu temple</p>

by a <i>Panchama </i>Hindu with the object of offering worship could
not by any stretch of the meaning of the word ‘insult’ constitute
an insult to the Hindu religion to which the accused claimed and was
admitted to belong. It may have been improper in the estimation of
some Hindus for the accused to enter the temple, it may have been
contrary to custom, it may have been a hundred other things, but it
was not an insult to the religion of any class such as to amount to a
crime under the Indian Penal Code. It is worthy of note that the
accused bore no visible marks of his despised birth. He was “dressed
properly and wearing marks of piety”. Indeed if these persecuted
men choose to practise deception, it would be imposible to
distinguish them from the rest. It is simple fanatical obstinacy to
persist in persecuting men in the sacred name of religion. It is the
persecutors who are unknowingly defiling their own religion by
keeping out of public temples men who are at least as honourable as
they claim to be themselves and are willing to abide by all the
ceremonial rules observable by Hindus in general on such occasions.
More than that no man has any right to impose or expect. The heart of

In spite of the weakness of body to which the Poet himself referred
in his address at the Abhoy Ashram, it was a good thing for Dr.
Suresh Bannerji, the manager of the Abhoy Ashram, at Comilla, to have
drawn Dr. Tagore there. The reader knows that the Abhoy Ashram was
established for the purpose of khaddar development. The Poet’s
acceptance of the address and such association as it may imply on his
part with khaddar movement dispels, if any dispeller was necessary,
the superstition that the Poet is against the spinning-wheel and the
khaddar movement in every shape or form. In the epitome of his
address published in the <i>Servant</i>, I find the following
reference to the movement:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.2cm; line-height: 125%">

<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.32cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
But there are other pregnant facts in the address which  are helpful
to workers for swaraj. This is what the Poet has to say to us:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.17cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">That
we were so long kept from realizing India in her true self is due to
the fact that we have not by daily endeavour created her moment by
moment making her healthful and fruitful.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 110%">
Thus he adjures us each one individually to make daily endeavour if
we are to gain swaraj. In the very next sentence he asks us “not to
cherish the dream that swaraj can be ours by some extraneous
happening”.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.2cm">The
Poet adds:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.19cm; line-height: 125%">
<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">It

throughout the country by service.</font></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 110%">
He tells us also how to attain unity. “We could attain unity <i>only
</i><i>through </i>work.” That is what the inmates of the Abhoy
Ashram are actually doing. For, through their spinning they are
helping Hindus, Mussalmans, in fact everybody, who needs help through
that source. They are teaching untouchable boys and girls through
their school and through it teach them to spin also. Through their
dispensary they are giving relief to the ailing irrespective of race
or religion. They need to preach no sermon on unity. They live it.
This work inspires the Poet and he therefore proceeds to say:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.81cm; margin-top: 0.16cm; line-height: 135%">

This is one out of many received by me pressing me to accept the
invitation from America. My reason is simple. I have not enough
self-confidence to warrant my going to America. I have no doubt that
the movement of non-violence has come to stay. I have no doubt
whatsoever about its final success; but I cannot give an ocular
demonstration of the efficacy of non-violence. Till then, I feel that
I must continue to preach from the narrower Indian platform. There is
no analogy between the illustrations cited and my case. But in any
case the Prophet and the Swami felt the call. I do not as yet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 95%">
The success of khaddar rests not merely upon sufficiency of funds.
There are many factors whose co-ordination is necessary for the
stabilization of khaddar. If ever I go to America, it will not be
with the intention of collecting funds for any Indian movement with
which I may be connected. India must shoulder her won burden and if
America feels the call to help she would do so not on the principle
of “give and take” but independently. My visit and America’s
help must each stand on its own merits.</p>

exaggeration. The slightest inaccuracy harms a pure movement. If
M.L.C.s spin the fact may be advertised but the movement must
continue in its purity whether M.L.C.s spin or not, whether many spin
or a few only. If it has intrinsic value, i.e., if there are millions
of starving people in India,  if they are idling away at least a
third of their time and if hand- spinning be the only occupation
immediately available for such a vast mass of humanity, the cult will
advance even if for the time being only one true man represents it.
If the assumptions be  wrong,  the movement will perish even though
the Viceroy may spin. Let every khadi worker then realize that this

I like your letters, the latest more especially, though I dissent
entirely from several of your conclusions. I like your robust faith
in the no-drug theory and I like also your insistence on my avoidance
of all drugs under every conceivable circumstance, but experience has
taught me that reformers develop a certain amount of intolerance and
fanaticism which hinder the reform that they have so much at heart.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The evils that you recite about quinine, for instance, are evils that
arise from taking large doses and for a prolonged period, whereas I
took it in five-grain doses, never more than 10 grains in 24 hours,
diluted in fresh lemon juice and plenty of water and mixed with soda
bicarb. In all, I took not more than 30 grains spread over 5 days.
Thus for 4 days I had only 5 grains per day. I have suffered from no
visible evil effect and I was able to satisfy so many anxious friends
and doctors who insisted on my taking 15-grain doses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
The indiscriminate attack upon quinine will prove futile because that
is the one drug whose general potency for the temporary cure of
malaria is not to be questioned. People won’t be frightened by the
possible evil effect of quinine if it produces the tangible present
result of checking the ravages of malaria. The attack therefore must
be a flank attack.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
The reasons for my taking quinine were just the same as the reasons
for undergoing the operation<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
 </font></sup><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt"> </font></sup>when
I was under restraint. If the restraint then induced me to give in,
how much more the restraint of unadulterated love should have done in
the latest instance? But nothing could either have induced me to
undergo the operation at the Sassoon hospital if I had not been
convinced that it was purely an echo of my own weakness. But that
weakness is weakness of faith in the absolute efficacy of what you
call “nature treatment”.  Even nature treatment is under
exploration and is a growing thing. It has not yet reached that
perfect stage when we can ensure absolute results. And if you have in
mind something beyond nature treatment, that is faith in God and
consequent absolute resignation; I own I have not yet</p>

I reason with you at length because I honour your sincerity, but  I
detect your growing impatience and intolerance which are calculated
to hinder your progress as a nature-cure advocate. Do not again run
away with the idea that all things that taste bitter are necessarily
bad. Bitterness, sweetness, etc., are relative terms. Do you know
that for some people sweetness in more nauseating than bitterness?
Will you not subscribe to the statement that a regular use of sugar
is more harmful than a regular use of the bitter <i>nim </i>leaf? And
I am not at all sure that a person who will clean his teeth well with
a brush made from <i>nim </i>tree will not keep his mouth in a nice
and healthy condition. Or will you prescribe for the him a
tea-spoonful of sugar powder to brush his teeth with?</p>

you to become strong and robust and to be an object-lesson and
advertisement for nature-cure.</p>

	There is no doubt about it that Tolstoy’s writings  had  a
	powerful effect on me. He strengthened my love of non-violence. He
	enabled me to see things more clearly than I had done before. His
	manner of putting this is all his own. At the same time I know that
	there were fundamental differences betwen us and though they will
	abide, they are of little consequence compared with so many things

I have your letter. I am glad of the settlement at Suchindram. Dr.
Naidoo did telegraph to me about it and I wrote him in reply that I
would not notice it in the pages of <i>Young India </i>till I had a

suppose therefore I must say nothing about it.</p>

I do not at all like the idea of your resigning the membership as  a
protest against the Dewan’s ruling. If every member who considers
some ruling to be unjust were to resign there would be no member
left. We must not become judges in our own suits in the manner you
have been. How do you know your interpretation is right and the
Dewan’s wrong? Of course, I know nothing of the merits but I know
the principle on which resignation by way of protest can be tendered.
The injustice of the ruling may be a cause for  moving  the
adjournment of the house or making a simple statement and doing many
other things, but surely not for resignation. I would like every act
of yours to be well-considered and dignifed. Your responsibility is
much greater than an ordinary member’s because you are a
representative of suppressed classes and unfortunately even an error
of judgement on your part will be magnified whereas many stupidities
on the part of ordinary members will be condoned.</p>

to finish the contract before you ask the Secretary to consider the
many points raised by you. I ask this because it was upon my own

methods that a big corporation like the All-India Spinners’

any single one of the items enumerated in the notice before me it
will have earned the name Swami Shraddhanandji has chosen to give his

The notice before me rightly places emphasis upon the work of
liberating the suppressed classes but there are still more numerous
classes held under suppression by our insane desire to clothe
ourselves in foreign cloth. And they are not a fifth of the
population of India but they are four-fifths and if the <i>Liberator
</i>will liberate villages from the temptation of cities, I venture
to suggest that the task is an impossibility without the
spinning-wheel.</p>

	I have your letter; I have also gone through your scheme. I do not
	see any substance in it. Cow-slaughter goes on only in towns and
	there is only one way of checking it viz., to bid higher than the
	butchers at the sales. This is possible only if we realize expense
	on all the cows that we recover, which again is not possible unless
	we take to dairy farming and a matter of religion start trading in
	hides, etc., from carcasses. Since we escape beef-eating by taking
	cow’s milk we regard it as sacred. In the same way since we
	thereby save the cattle from being butchered we should regard it our
	sacred duty to utilize their carcasses for hides, bones, etc. Now we
	find ourselves facing two things: one to seek the help of dairy and
	tanning technicians; second to disabuse the minds of the people and
	convince them that it is not only righteous but also religious to
	deal in hides, bones, etc., of dead animals. If my view is correct,
	we may run our <i>goshalas </i>and <i>pinjrapoles </i>on the model
	of dairies and tanneries.</p>

be the common property of every Indian. If then the <i>Hindustani

appreciate its object, they cannot do better than give to the

mill-made cloth and use only hand-spun and hand-woven khaddar and

They copy of your third letter is deeply interesting. Your jail
experience is very useful. Your impressions of the things as you see
them after your discharge from the prison provoke deep thinking. I
agree with you that non-co-operation has not failed and that we have
not seen the last of it. I agree also that swaraj is nearer than many
may think. The whole thing resolves itself into conversion of the
educated classes. This is bound to happen if some of us remain true
as I know we will. The attitude of a staunch non-co-operationist like
myself towards the Swarajists requires fairly elaborate argument. I
shall not therefore deal with it here. Put in one sentence, I can say
that my attitude is based upon the hope that most is to be expected
from them in the way of a forward policy.</p>

subsidiary employment amongst those like the Punjab farmers whose
time is almost fully occupied with more profitable concerns. But the

country as a whole should think of the millions of paupers and for
their sake wear khaddar and spin for half an hour per day by way of
example and encouragement if nothing else. Its greatest political
value should not escape your keen penetrative intellect. It lies in
the fact that millions who are today leading less than animal life
will have an honourable occupation and a means of livelihood. Today
they can be induced to do nothing whilst they are passive instruments
of submission to any tyrant. And why does khaddar lose its political
importance because I invited Lord Reading to use it? Will non-co-
operation or civil disobedience lose their importance if I invited
Lord Reading to take to either or both?</p>

Lastly, civil revolution on a mass scale I hold to be an
impossibility unless we acquire sufficient control and influence over
the masses so as to ensure their abstention from disturbing the peace
of the country by a violent demonstration. Every time in the past
when I have called off Civil Resistance upon outbreak of violence,
you will find that Congressmen had a hand in it and that therefore it
had a political value. I should not hesitate to go forward even if
there were a thousand eruptions in the country if I was sure that
they had nothing to do with the political upheaval and that
Congressmen had no hand in them directly or indirectly.</p>

Regarding my health I am certainly weak but you have given me full
credit by hoping that I know the value of my life much better than
any of my admirers. I assure you that I shall try to conserve it to
the best of my ability but old age will overtake the most careful
men. On the whole I think that I am keeping very good health.</p>

	It is a novel suggestion of yours that you should send as sub-
	scription for <i>Young India </i>hand-spun yarn. There is no rule
	made in this connection and there is no facility in <i>Young India
	</i>office for receipt of yarn in lieu of subscription but if you
	send 50,000 yards of 20 counts evenly-spun, well-twisted yarn to my
	personal address, I shall see that it is accepted in lieu of
	subscription, that is to say, it will be taken by the Ashram and the
	money will be paid to the <i>Young </i><i>India </i>Office. 50,000
	yards of yarn is rather an over-estimate and not an under-estimate
	but it is not possible to put the exact estimate and receive the
	yarn. I shall have to get it examined and tested before acceptance.
	If you decide to send this yarn, please make it into proper strands
	of 500 yards each because if the yarn causes any difficulty in
	testing or counting it will not be accepted in lieu of subscription
	and it will have to be returned if you so desire against payment of

Your letter. A vow applies to only good deeds. One does not resolve
to do something wrong. If through ignorance one should  make any such
vow it is one’s duty to break it. For instance if one had vowed to

members had asked for the return of their yarn is beside the point.
The pertinent question is whether anyone had done so. The answer to
this will be found in the note in <i>Navajivan</i>. If the yarn is
not returned, how can any member then supply the same yarn again? If,
however, we want to know reasons for distrust, there are plenty of
them. The same yarn was given by many members again and again to get
themselves enrolled as members of the Congress. Not only this, but
even the Congress committee had openly used the same bundles over and
over again. Taking certain precautions, however, does not imply
distrust and should certainly not be understood in that light. It is
not distrust of their children which prompts parents to place certain
restrictions on them, but the knowledge of the laxity to which human
nature is inclined in the absence of precautions. Following the same
principle, institutions frame rules in the nature of restraints on
their members for their protection and men and women impose
restrictions on themselves which we know as vows, to save themselves
from yielding to temptations. That people do not feel drawn to join

Association, this indeed is the real trouble. To say that they do not
feel drawn is as much as to say that they do not believe, it can do
any good. Were it not so, why should not thousands and hundreds of
thousands of men and women contribute yarn for the selfless <i>yajna
</i>which the Spinners’Association has organized? If, however, the
people do not feel drawn to it, is that any reason why the
organizers, too, should remain slack? Should they cheapen membership
of the Association? We ought to get rid of the false notion that
there is no gain in anything which does not fill one’s pocket. If
the members hold the Association in high esteem, sooner or later the
world will accept it at their estimation, for the cause it serves is
a sacred one. Just as, to a mother, her child is more beautiful than
other children, so should an institution be dear to those who run it
and to its thoughtful members, even if the world thinks little of
them and, therefore, of theirinstitution. If the person who first
repeated the name of Rama by way of prayer had felt ashamed of doing
so or valued the name as merely helping him to get the pleasures of
heaven, Rama would have been today no more than one among the
thirty-three crores of gods. But that devotee of Rama linked the name
with <i>moksha</i>, and the result has been that a good many people
have attained <i>moksha </i>by uttering Rama’s name in prayer. God
is always at the service of his devotees; He is ever the Servant of
His servants. He justifies the devotee’s faith. What is true about
God and His devotees is also true about an institution and its
organizers. I hope, therefore, that my correspondent, a lover of the
spinning-wheel, will forget his pain and  be  happy instead, that he
will look upon the Spinners’ Association as  no  ordinary
institution and will be able to see, and will help others to see,
that some effort is required to get back one’s yarn from the
Association. The value of his yarn, then, will rise in his eyes.
Those who have money, therefore, and wish, to their great credit, to
wear cloth woven from yarn spun by themselves, should welcome the
restrictions laid down by the Secretary of the Production Section. I
would, however, most certainly suggest that the members should
welcome the yarn given to the All-India Spinners’ Association being
utilized for the benefit of the whole country. It would be more
commendable on their part to look upon such yarn as an offering in a
<i>yajna </i>and not to wish to have it returned.</p>

The principle which we have applied to the system of British
Government is applicable here also. If the people co-operate in order
not to allow that system to continue, its foundation will go; it will
crumble right today. Similarly, if one wishing to end the empire of
evil customs offers non-co-operation that empire will certainly crack
up. The question naturally arises as to what purpose will be served
if only one person non-co-operates thus. One answer to this is that
he who launches non-co-operation wins and becomes free from faults,
and the empire is weakened to the extent of the loss of his  co-
operation. A house does not collapse if a single brick is removed,
but everyone realizes that from the day the brick came off the house
has certainly begun to get weakened. While it is difficult for the
first brick to get loose, it is not so for the second brick to fall
away or get removed. Every reform in the world has been initiated by
the efforts of one man. Today even an appropriate atmosphere has been
created in respect of evil customs like child-marriage, etc. Those
who regard them as evil customs are lax only in regard to acting
against them. If we today try to take an opinion poll, the majority
will hold that customs like child-marriage and spending lavishly on
marriages are evil and costly dresses of foreign material are
reprehensible and evil. Majority opinion can be had against other
such evil customs. Despite this, they have not disappeared because
those who are oposed to them are truly speaking weak and, while they
are brave in bragging, they are afraid to act. That cowardice will
disappear only when a number of people refrain from attending such
functions even by putting themselves to trouble.</p>

	I have your letter. I can understand your grief. Some sorrows, only
	time can cure. We should therefore keep our peace meanwhile. If your
	resolve is firm, and since you have not yet chosen a field of work
	and a marriage is not likely to be proposed so long as you do not
	become self-supporting, you can very well persuade your mother and
	your elder brother telling them about your resolve firmly but with
	due humility. If your mind is still wavering and a desire for
	conjugal life lingers in your heart, the best course is to act
	according to the elders’ advice. True, a well-to-do widower finds
	it difficult to avoid a second marriage. He alone might escape for
	whom a second marriage is very painful. I would advise you to think
	over it with a quiet mind and in solitude. You may then act as you
	are impelled. I can only show you how [to come to a decision]. While
	actually making a decision, you should put aside my advice as well
	as all other suggestions and follow fearlessly the dictates of your
	own heart. May God soon grant peace to your daughter.</p>

	I have your letter. I do not at present intend to get involved in
	the controversy whether a rise or fall in food-grain prices is in
	the interest of the farmer. But the spinning-wheel is in a way
	related to this question. With the progress of the wheel India’s
	biggest industry can be revived and that again through the poor
	farmers. Thus in any event the charkha movement is in the best
	interests of the farmers. If it is a fact that for at least four
	months farmers remain idle then the movement which brings so much
	work must mean a rise in their earnings. Looking at the charkha
	movement from this angle, we shall realize that khaddar is not a
	matter merely of swadeshi but one of bringing a new industry into
	the farmer’s household.</p>

	I have your letter. Eight months is a long time for me to be away
	from India. I should undestand however the details of the programme
	and the nature of the work I would be expected to do. I should also
	like to know what place Chinese Christians occupy in the national
	movement and whether I will be expected to address only Christian
	audiences. I won’t come to a hasty decision, and if I go at all
	the only inducement would be a prospect of serving China by inducing
	her to accept the message of non-violence for her freedom. To think
	the matter out clearly I think it is necessary for some
	representative Chinese to come here, discuss things with me and find
	out for themselves whether there is really one mind between them and
	me. I have no desire to go there for a mere spectacular
	demonstration.</p>

I wanted to reply to your letter at leisure. Today is my silence day;
so I can spare the time. I catch the meaning hidden in a certain
statement in your letter. I can see that the reply cannot be just
“what I please”. I have always regarded you as Moti’s teacher
and you can prove one if you will restrain yourself. We have
tyrannized much over the gentler sex. Now that they are trained to
become free, they may go too far. But we should not be alarmed. Of
course, you should be patient and help Moti see all this. I am ever
ready to help you. I read her letters carefully and I too am pained.
I see no love in her letters, nor even any interest. Moti writes just
to be done with it. She would drop it if she could. Write to me, if
you think it proper to release her from her vow. We must not force
her to write. Even her handwriting shows no improvement.</p>

	My message to America is simply the hum of this wheel. Letters and

	over-rates the results of Non-violent Non-co-operation and the other
	set onto only under-rates it but imputes all kinds of motives to
	those who are concerned with the movement. Don’t exaggerate one
	way or the other. If therefore some earnest Americans will study the
	movement impartially and patiently then it is likely that the United
	States may know something of the movement which I do consider to be
	unique although I am the author of it. What I mean is that our
	movement is summed up in the spinning-wheel with all its implica-

	message of self-reliance and hope to the millions of India. And when
	they are really awakened they would not need to lift their little
	finger in order to regain their freedom. The messge of the
	spinning-wheel is, really, to replace the spirit of exploitation by

	exploitation. I have no desire</p>

(As to the effects of multiplication of means of travel and
transportation:)All that is coming to smother us, not to deliver us.
I can only say I hope that we shall be spared that affliction. But it
may be we shall have to drink the bitter cup. If we do not learn by
the experience of the West, we may have to drink it. But I am leaving
no stone unturned to avoid that catastrophe. The powers of the West,
however much they have fought amongst themselves, have agreed on
this: “Let us exploit the other Nations—Asia and Africa”. They
are keeping up to that agreement with extraordinary accuracy. Suppose
we reciprocate. Suppose we learn all the tricks of our Western
teachers—What will happen? A mightier copy of what happened in
August 1914. It will come if Europe and America continue to say: “We
shall be top dogs and you others shall be bottom dogs” and we do
not learn the message of non-violence and understand that we have but
to cease to buy from you what we do not need. Therefore in spite of
all evidence to the contrary, I do my best not to co-operate with
that spirit of exploitation. I decline to copy even though I am but
one in three hundred millions. At least I shall die with the
satisfaction of knowing I die in doing what my consience directs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; line-height: 102%">
We can be exploited only with our own consent, whether forced or
willing, conscious or unconscious, and only if we buy all sorts of
attrac-tive things that Europe and America produce. Mainly clothing.
This we can avoid because we have not yet quite lost the cunning of
our hands. The task of so providing for our needs will prove no
burden but can be met just as we eat and drink—a little at a time
in the course of each day, during spare hours. There are many things
today for which I am depen-dent on the West. When I am sure that I
take only that is better done there and what is beneficent to me, it
will be an honourable, free and mutually advantageous bargain. But
what is now done is a bargain des-tructive to both sides. For
exploitation is as bad for one as for the other.</p>

I want this country to be spared Dyerism. That is, I do not want my
country, when it has the power, to resort to frightfulness in order
to impose her custom on others. Very often we have to learn by hard
experience, but if I believe that every one of us had to go in a
vicious circle and do just what every other has done, I should know
that no progress is possible and should preach the doctrine of
suicide. But we hope, and train our children in the hope, that they
will avoid the</p>

mistakes of their fathers. Indeed I see sings, very faint, but
unmistakable, of a better day in the West. A tremendous movement is
going on in the West today to retrace steps. There is much progress
in the thought world, although little is as yet translated into
action. But what the thinkers are thinking today, tomorrow will be
action.</p>

I have almost daily visits from Americans, not in idle curiosity, not
in the spirit of “Let us see this animal in the Indian Zoo”, but
from real interest to know my ideas. Those who see the poverty of
India and feel grieved should probe under the surface and find its
real cause. It is not as if it were slowly decreasing. It is growing,
in spite of hospitals, schools, metalled roads and railways. In spite
of all these you find the people are being ground  down as  between 
two millstones. They live in enforced idleness. A century  ago  every
cottage was able to replenish its resources by means of the spinning-
wheel. Now every farmer, scratching the earth only a few inches deep
with the wooden plough, works in the season of cultivation. But he
cannot do much work in the other seasons of the year. What are he,
his children and his women then to do? The women sat at the wheel in
the old days and sang something not obscene—not trash—but a song
to the Maker of us all. The children imbibed it and so this custom
was handed down and the children had it, although they were without
polish or literary education. But now it has all but died away. The
mother is groaning under poverty, her spirit is darkened. She has no
milk. As soon as the child is weaned, she has only gruel to give it,
that ruins the intestines.</p>

I take to them the gospel of hope—the spinning-wheel—saying, “I
do this thing myself, side by side with you, and I give you coppers
for your yarn. I take your yarn that you have spun in your own place,
in your own time, at your own sweet will.” She [the mother] listens
with a little bit of hope in her eyes. At the end of five weeks
during which she has had help and co-operation regularly, I find
light in her eyes. “Now”, she says, “I shall be able to get
milk for my baby”. Then if she can have this work regularly she
re-establishes a happy home. Multiply that scene by three hundred
millions and you have a fair picture of what I am hoping for.</p>

Hunter, first showed that the poverty of the masses is growing rather
than decreasing. The villages I have visited show it. The East India
Company records show it. In those days we were exporters not
exploiters. We delivered our goods faithfully. We had no gun-boats to
send for punishing those who would not buy our goods. We sent out the
most wonderful fabrics the world has produced. We exported diamonds,
gold, spices. We had our fair share of iron ore. We had indigenous
and unfadable dyes. All that is now gone. Not to speak of Dacca
muslin, which was mistaken for dew. I can’t produce it today, but I
hope to.</p>

The East India Company came to buy, and remained to sell. It
compelled us to cut off our thumbs. They stood over us and made us
behave against our wills till thousands of us cut off our thumbs.
This is no figment of my imagination but can be verified from the
records of the East India Company. Do I lay the blame on Britain.
Certainly I do! By means the foulest imaginable our trade was
captured and then killed by them in order to make a market for their
own goods. Practically at the point of the bayonet they forced us to
work. For suppose I am tired of work—tired as we were tired till we
cut off our thumbs to avoid being driven farther—is not that the
pressure of the bayonet? This is the history of how our skill was
lost.</p>

You say that the spinning-wheel, a few generations ago a household
tool in the West, has there also disappeared. But they of the West
who spun and spin no more were free men and gave it up by choice.
They had a substitute for the spinning-wheel. Here we have no
substitute even now for the millions. If an Indian farmer wants to
set up a soap factory or a basket factory, can he do it? Where can he
sell his produce? But I am trying to induce the people to understand
the secret of the wheel. Compulsion that comes from within is
differnet from that which is superimposed upon you. I would teach my
people to resist that outer compulsion, to the point of death.</p>

There is difficulty in now reviving the art of spinning because the
people have lost their liking for it. It is difficult to teach the
habit of work to a people who have lost all hope and who have done no
work for years and years. And our rich men think that they can
redress all the wrongs they have done in amassing their riches by
throwing a handful of rice in the faces of the poor. Whereby they
only spoil them so that if I go afterwards with cotton in one hand
and coppers in the other I suffer in consequence. And I can bring no</p>

force to bear, I have no power of government at my back to compel
them. So my task goes slowly. I have to plod. Yet thousands spin
today who did not spin last year. My success when it comes will lead
to the development of other home industries and in the meantime the
central difficulty will be solved because the vast mass of our
troubles proceeds from enforced idleness.</p>

Untouchability can be cured by those who understand being true to
themselves. You saw the squabble that arose in the Hindu Mahasabha.
But untouchability is going in spite of all opposition, and going
fast. It has degraded Indian humanity. The “untouchables” are
treated as if less than beasts. Their very shadow defiles, in the
name of God. I am as strong, or stronger, in denouncing
untouchability as I am in denouncing British methods imposed on
India. Untouchability for me is more insufferable than British rule.
If Hinduism hugs untouchability, then Hinduism is dead and gone, in
spite of the lofty message of the Upanishads and the <i>Gita</i>—as
pure as crystal. But what is the teaching worth if their practice
denies it.</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">ANSWER: </font>Surely. But that
is a counsel of perfection. All the teaching that we have received in
the Universities has made us clerks or platform orators. I never
heard the word spinning-wheel in all my school days. I never had any
teacher, Indian or English, who taught me to go to the villages. All
their teaching was to aspire to government positions. To them the
I.C.S. was almost a heaven-born thing, and the height of worldly
ambition was to become a member of Council. Even today I am told I
must go to the Council, to tell the Government the needs of the
people and debate them on the floor of the House. No one says “Go
to the villages”. That movement has come in spite of the contrary
teaching in schools. our young people have become dis- Indianized.
They are unaccustomed to the life of the villages. There you have to
live in insanitary conditions. If you won’t take the spade and
shovel in your own hands, you will die a miserable death from dirt
and infecion. I have lost some of my own workers because of malaria
although they knew the laws of health. The movement towards the
villages has come but it is slow.</p>

British meant to do me harm. But self-deception is the most horrible
crime of which human nature is capable. And the bayonet of the old
days yet remains in some shape. I have rechristened it Dyerism. And I
would like to see the Briton utterly gone except as he remains as
India’s employee, in India’s pay. For this he might as well be a
Frenchman, a German, or a Chinaman. The Briton has admirable
qualities—because the is a human being. I would say the same of an

strife? Of the hordes of Afghanistan?” Yes, but these are

The sooner the brave Sikhs put their house in order and thus prove
their bravery the better it is for them and India. Bravery is simple,
never complex. It is dignified, never shoddy. It is noble, never
mean. It is ever forgiving, never revengeful. It ever sheds its
protective fragrance about it, never strikes wherever it goes. It is
a guarantee of peace<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1   </font></sup>not
of war. It is an epitome of concord, never spells discord. Do the
Sikhs satisfy all these tests? If not, it is time they did. For, they
are pledged to free not merely the Punjab Gurudwaras but the great
Indian Gurudwara of swaraj.</p>

I have your letter. I remember you well and I have pleasant
recollections of my visit to your place. Please tell the friend in
Burma that though I took the arsenic and iron injections, I retain
the same views I have expressed in my writings about drugs and
doctors. It is one thing to hold an ideal and another thing to live
up to it. At the present moment friends insinuate that I am no longer
master of my own body, that they and others are as much interested in
it as I am and by their specious reasoning make me believe that I am
one of the trustees for the up-keep of the body and thus entitled to
pamper it. And so friends like the one in Burma rightly find an
inconsistency between the ideal I have professed and the practice
that I am now</p>

distressful sight of famine-stricken people who flock to the temple
to get a handful of dirty rice from the pilgrims. Puri reminds me not
of the holy associations it once had but of the degradation to which
we have been reduced now. For, is it not now a sanatorium  for  the
soldiers who are paid with our own money to suppress our liberty?
Puri has no attraction for me. It makes me sad to think of it. And I
felt miserable all the time I was there though friends had put me in
a most comfortable place just facing the sea-side and were covering
me with extraordinary kindness. But they had no remedy for  the 
mental torture that I was going through as I contemplated the
barracks and the misery of those starving Oriyans and the callous
indifference of the moneyed people.</p>

I can thoroughly understand the wonderful behaviour of your sister. I
wish her all success in her defiance of drugs and doctors. I envy her
courage. She will quit her body, even as the <i>Bhagavad Gita
</i>describes, joyfully, i.e., even as an owner leaves his house
which has given its use and is now about to crumble to pieces.</p>

	Your letter. It indicates that the residents of the said
	neighbourhood belong predominantly to the Kadva Patidar community
	and they also own the houses there. If it is so, since everyone has
	a right to privacy in his own residence, the Patidars too, I think,
	should enjoy it. The case of South Africa is different. In South
	Africa there is a move to ruin the local population by depriving
	them of their established rights. If I am making a mistake, if the
	Patidar community are tyrannizing over anyone, then your
	non-co-operation would be justified.</p>

	The 6th and the 13th of April are never-to-be-forgotten days in our
	national life. The 6th of April, 1919 witnessed an unparalleled
	demonstration in which Hindus, Mussalmans and others joined freely.
	It was too a day of freedom for the suppressed classes. That day
	laid the foundation for true swadeshi. And it was the day when the
	whole country offered civil disobedience. The spirit of mass freedom
	and mass resistance was abroad.</p>

The 13th April witnessed the Jallianwala massacre in which Hindu,
Mussalman and Sikh blood mingled in one scarlet stream. A dungheap
was turned in a day into a place of political pilgrimage for all
India. It will remain that till India lives. Since that day many
events have happened. Hope rose high in 1921 to be dashed seemingly
to pieces the very moment it rose to the highest point. The tide has
appeared to be ebbing ever since. We are passing through midnight
gloom. Possibly we have not yet seen the worst.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
But that sacred week is still our hope and therefore we must
celebrate it even though we are rent in twain and the Government
safely flouts national demands, be they ever so pressing and withal
reasonable.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; line-height: 110%">
There is no perpetual night on God’s earth. Ours too will have its
ending. Only we must work for it. How to celebrate the week then? Not
by hartal. Not yet by civil disobedience. We cannot proclaim or
celebrate the unity of Hindus and non-Hindus, for we Hindus and
Mussalmans distrust one another and seek to consolidate our strength
and power rather through the Government favour than  through mutual
forbearance and help. That question must therefore for the time being
be left to work itself out. Untouchability is slowly but surely
dying. Khaddar alone lends itself to mass demonstration and mass
effort. It is the platform on which all can work hand in hand. Sales
can be organized. Voluntary spinning can be  pushed. Collections can
be made for the All-India Das Memorial Fund whose sole object is the
promotion of the spinning-wheel  and  khaddar. There are no doubt
many other ways of celebrating the national week. It is open to local
workers to devise various ways. I can only think of things in which
millions can take part, which remind us of those seven days and which
can promote swaraj. I can think of nothing else that satisfies all
the conditions so well as the spinning-whell.</p>

Oh, that we can do one thing truly and well! It will rstore lost
self-confidence and it will give us a strength that can carry all
before it. The spinning-wheel is the one thing which men, women, boys
and girls of all classes and religions can work. It is the one thing
that can establish a link between the rich and the poor and it is the
one thing that can bring a ray of sunshine into the dark and 
dilapidated dungeon of the half-starved peasantry. Let those who have
faith in the wheel work to make khaddar more popular during the
national week.</p>

able to control the <i>takli </i>spinning of hundreds of boys and

Though there is from my point of view much left to be done in respect
of sanitation in the prisons of India, I can corroborate the
description given by my correspondent. Prison sanitation is certainly
superior to the sanitation of our villages. In fact, it is want of
sanitation which one regretfully observes in the villages, no matter
in what part one visits them. Simialarly, simplicity of the jail
dietary is also commendable and if the middle classes were to
simplify their diet there will be an enormous saving in their wealth
and heatlh.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.13cm; line-height: 110%">
The suggestion that the youth of the country should pass some time in
the jails before embarking upon life and after finishing their
scholastic career is certainly attractive, but how is it to be
carried out? Unless a revival of civil disobedience gives the
students a chance of seeking imprisonment, the only way for them to
reproduce prison discipline is to bury themselves for a season at
least in villages and there live the simple life of the villages
minus their insanitation. They can become their own scavengers, as to
an extent every prisoner must be.</p>

<font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt">As
regards “the things as I see them now”, I am glad I do not feel
as much disappointed as many of my friends do. I do not feel that
non-co-operation has failed or that we have seen its last. I still
believe that India will get swaraj in the near future and that the
final victory is to be achieved through civil revolution. We may have
to change our programme, but the salvation is to come through that
source alone. I believe that the victory is to come to us in the near
future. By near future, I do not mean one year, nor even five years,
but certainly less than ten years, because, I find the heart of the
people still sound. What is wrong is with those who have to give lead
to the people. It is the educated classes to whom the common people
generally look for guidance who have gone astray. If they could again
realize their responsibilities, the masses would follow their
footsteps as surely as the magnet follows the poles.</font></font></p>

correspondent’s faith in non-co-operation and civil disobedience!
He who runs may see that though non-co-operation has not brought us
swaraj in the tangible sense that the people undestand, it has
revolutionized our political aspect; has brought into being mass
consciousness which in my opinion nothing else could have done. And
there is no doubt about it that whenever freedom comes, it will come
through some application of non-co-operation including civil
disobedience. For, inspite of whatever may be said to the contrary,
the method of violence has no following worth the  name  especially 
among the masses, and no method for the attainment of swaraj can
possibly succeed unless the masses also adopt it. If the definiton of
swaraj includes the freedom not of a certain number of individuals or
certain classes but of the whole of the masses of India, only non-co-
operation and all that it means can regulate that mass consciousness
which is absolutely necessary for democratic swaraj. Only
non-violent, and therefore constructive, methods will weld the masses
together and fire them with a national purpose and give them the
desire and ability to achieve and defend national freedom.</p>

do not attach as much importance to its political value as people
generally used to do in 1921. I do not believe that English people

play an equally important part. Your invitation to Lord Reading to

khaddar. I venture to suggest to him and to those who think with him
that its political value springs from its economic value. A starving
man thinks first of satisfying his hunger before anything else. The
celebrated incident of a disciplined sage like Vishwamitra, whose
austerities have hardly been matched, stooping even to steal
forbidden food when he was famishing, shows the stress under which a
starving man labours. He will sell his liberty and all for the sake
of getting a morsel of food. Sailors struggling for want of food in
mid-ocean have been known to resort to cannibalism in order to
satisfy their hunger. Such is the position of millions of the people
of India. For them liberty, God, and all such words are merely
letters put together without the slightest meaning. They jar upon 
them. They will extend a welcome to any person who comes to them with
a morsel of food. And if we want to give these people a sense of
freedom we shall have to provide them with work which they can easily
do in their desolate homes and which would give them at least the
barest living. This can only be done by the spinning-wheel. And when
they have become self-reliant and are able to support themselves, we
are in a position to talk to them about freedem, about Congress etc.
Those therefore, who bring them work and means of getting a crust of
bread will be their deliverers and will be also the people who will
make them hunger for liberty. Hence the political value of the
spinning-wheel, apart from its further abilityto displace foreign
cloth and thus remove the greatest temptation in the way of
Englishmen to hold India even at the risk of having to repeat the
Jallianwala massacre times without number.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.04cm; line-height: 102%">
And why should khaddar lose its political value because I invite Lord
Reading to adopt it? Surely we have no quarrel with Englishmen as
such. The method of non-co-operation is a method of conversion of
Englishmen to thinking in terms of India. If they will respond to our
dearest aspirations; if they will make common cause with us and wear
khaddar; co-operate with us in making India dry and reducing the
frightful military expenditure and are prepared to remain in India
not on the strength of their bayonets but on that of our goodwill;
will</p>

they not be welcome co-workers in common cause? In my opinion the
invitation to Englishmen to adopt khaddar and the spinning-wheel
enhances their political value, while at the same time it robs them
of the slightest trace of suspicion that there is in them any
antagonism to Englishmen as such.</p>

The treatment itself that this registration implies, it is not 
difficult to understand. It is the same thing as in South Africa. The
only difference is in degree and I doubt not that if a much larger
number of Indians settle in the British Isles there will be a panic
which will be followed by legislation. Not very long ago one read in
the papers that Chinese washermen were almost lynched in Liverpool.
Things are no better in America. I printed only the other day on the
subject a letter from an Indian student in that  Continent.  I  had
recently a visit from an America-returned student. He is a cultured
man speaking faultless English, having subdued manners. He gave me a
painful picture of American prejudice against colour and left on me
the impression that it was on the increase. The question therefore
that is agitating South Africa is not a local one but it is a
tremendous world problem. Whilst Asiatic races are held under
subjection and are indifferent to their own welfare, it is easy
enough to treat them as they are being treated, whether in England or
in America or in Africa; for that matter in their own homes as in
China and in India. But they will not long remain asleep. One can but
hope therefore that their awakening may not lead to making confusion
worse confounded and adding to the racial bitterness already
existing. There is however no hope of avoiding the catastrophe unless
the spirit of exploitation that at present dominates the nations of
the West is transmuted into that of real helpful service, or unless
the Asiatic and the African races understand that they cannot be
exploited without their co-operation, to a large extent voluntary,
and thus understanding, withdraw such co- operation. Take the present
instance itself. These brave Punjabis need</p>

not put up with the insult of submission to the racial discrimination
which is sought to be imposed upon them. They need not stay where
they are unwelcome visitors, or if they must stay, they need not
submit to humiliating treatment and they should suffer the
consequence of disobedience in the shape of imprisonment. It is often
found that those against whom discrimination is made are in some
measure, be it ever so slight, responsible for it. If such is the
case with the Punjabis, they should remove every such excuse so that
their cause may be found to be above reproach. If man, no matter what
pigment he wears, will realize his status, he will discover that it
is possible for him to stand erect even before a whole world in
opposition.</p>

In passing I would like to draw the attention of the framers of the
general letter from which I have quoted, that whilst it is brief and
otherwise admirable, it jars by reason of the emphasis laid by the
writers upon “signal services rendered by Indians during Britain’s
time of greatest affliction and crisis recorded in the annals  of 
history”.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
If India rendered willing service at the time of the War, its value
is diminished by demanding gratitude, for it was rendered as a duty
and “duty will be merit when debt becomes a donation.” The fact
however is that the service was not willingly rendered. Force or the
threat of it was a po-tent consideration that prompted it. It is the
prudential restraint of Eng-lishmen that they do not every time, on
mention of these services, retort that we rendered them as <i>begar</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1
  </font></sup>even as when officials on tour in the Indian villages
impress labour. The people who were forced out of their homes in the
Punjab to serve at the time of the War have little cause to be proud
of their service, still less to evoke the gratitude of the British
Government. The gratitude went to Sir Michael O’Dwyer who demanded
and got his quota of recruits, cost what it might, from every
district of the Punjab.</p>

your difficulties. You will please tell me whatever burden you cannot
shoulder. Your central work is to develop theAshram you have
established, everything else is subsidiary. If, therefore, such
responsibility as coming to a decision on matters I may refer to you
and supervising such institutions that may be established as a result
of the advice you may give are beyond your strength, you will not 
hesitate to say so, but if you can handle  these  things  without

Similarly I want you to advise me regarding the undisposed of South
India Flood Relief Fund. Mathuradas has a respectable sum in his
hands and so have I. What do you want done? We must come to quick
decision. The different funds can be amalgamated and a trust created
for the development of spinning and khaddar in the areas that were
affected by flood. Other areas that are subjected to periodical
famine and floods may also be included in the trust. But you may have
some other suggestions to make.</p>

I had promptly gone through the article which you had left for me
regarding the question of monkeys. In the article, as in your letter,
you have offered no final solution of the problem. What we want now
is a solution which is perfectly consistent with religion. Of course
it will be implemented in course of time. How can we get over age-old
sentiments unless we have very grave reasons? But we face now only
the religious aspect of the problem. Let us not forget we have been
ourselves promo-ting the multiplication of monkeys and now we are a
passive witness to their destruction; (1) Englishmen and others
destroying the monkeys that visit their neighbourhood, and (2) the
export to foreign countries of live specimens for experiments while
yet alive. And the third inconsistency is that we feel a secret joy
at the fall in their number due to these two causes. What can we do
in such circumstances? If we can free ourselves from the sin of
destroying a few monkeys, it is perhaps our duty to do so; or as
members of society, it may be our duty to remain passive witnesses to
it. What is one’s obligation towards the society of which one is a
member? Solution of the monkey problem will cover that of the
pigeons. I have no doubt we are deliberately promoting the breeding
of pigeons. The <i>pinjrapole </i>is a modern institution. I do not
think it functions with</p>

enlightened compassion. It is like swallowing a camel and straining
at a gnat. At the moment I am examining non-violence as a principle,
and I have come to believe that, in the case of monkeys and the like,
our attitude is governed solely by tradition; we pay no attention it
seems, to their well-being. There is another question arising out of
non-violence. In the event of violence to one’s person, where may a
non-violent aspirant draw the line?</p>

	visiting Dwarka and other places, but it does not follow that none
	else may have such faith. There is nothing wrong in visiting such
	places of pilgrimage with a clear conscience. So I suggested that
	you should take your wife and others to Dwarkaji. The final place of
	pilgrimage is of course one’s own pure heart. Recitation of
	<i>Ramanama </i>is the only remedy for your mental agony.</p>

	Whom may we regard as untouchables? It is very  sinful  to regard
	anyone as untouchable by birth. He who has faith in his heart and is
	pure in body—what is the harm in his entering a temple? You should
	clear yourself of the blemish of untouchability. It is not proper
	for you to uphold untouchability.</p>

	I have your letter. How can I convince you I have no prejudice
	against Shivji? Nor do I regard myself as prejudiced. I am eager to
	know my mistake, admit it and make necessary amends, but then you or
	someone else for that matter should point it out to me. Bhai Shivji
	is himself responsible for whatever opinion I have formed. When I
	made inquiries about him that was out of my love for him and with
	his consent too. I admit I had no right to do so if he would not
	agree to it. Nor did the proposal for arbitration come from me. I
	had offered to talk to any person of Shivji’s choice who could
	convince me about his innocence in some way. If ultimately an
	arbitration comes about that will be at Shivji’s instance. If it
	is delayed, that again is due to him, or say due to Bhai Mavji. When
	the arbitration starts I shall certainly hand over your letter to
	them. I shall not with- hold anything from the arbitrators. This I
	promise. I admire your devotion to Shivji, and I can also appreciate
	your feelings. Believe me I am pained at your grief. But can I
	possibly force out of my mind something of which I am deeply
	convinced?</p>

	Somehow or other my mental framework will not accommo- date an
	European visit for the mere purpose of giving me rest. I can think
	of many such places in and about India. Ceylon or Burma for
	instance, if not Kashmir, as a matter of fact nothing will delight
	me more than to go to Kashmir or some inaccessible hill  in  the
	Himalayas. If, therefore, I go to Finland, it would have to be some
	substantial inducement. Coming in close touch with the world’s
	students is undoubtedly attractive. Hence, it was that instead of
	final refusal as in the case of America, I gave an in-decisive
	answer about the Finland invitation. Since then it has not
	materialized any further. If the invitation is repeated, I shall
	deal with it on merits. But I assure you that there is no need for
	the change and rest as in your case. What shall I do if friends will
	exaggerate?</p>

	If, however, I do go to Finland, I would certainly be delighted to
	have you as guide, friend and philosopher. For, I know nothing of
	Europe except London and a few sea-side places in England and Paris

dictating my reply to find time for writing but the right hand being
in need of rest and left-hand writing somewhat tedious especially
when you are hard pressed for time, in order not to delay
acknowledging your letter any longer, I am resorting to dictation.</p>

I sympathize with you in your difficulty, but at the present moment
who can resist the pressing storm? All therefore one can hope is that
in the new situation no Non-co-operators may find themselves [<i>sic</i>].
They will acquit themselves with credit to the country. It will be
something if you are able to retain khaddar  and pervade the
atmosphere around you with the mentality for which khaddar stands.</p>

I have your letter. You say you like khaddar for a blouse; will you
not now take to khadi saris also. How can a patriotic person come to
have a taste for foreign cloth? If we love our country we should have
a liking for indigenous goods. O ne who dislikes cloth woven by the
poor Indian from his homespun yarn, how can such a one be regarded a

given up foreign cloth and have taken to hand-spun  khaddar.</p>

	not mean that every Bhatia family gives away their daughters only
	for a consideration. If receiving a consideration is a general
	practice I do not think I am guilty of exaggeration. You might be
	aware that, since girls are not easily available, many Bhatias get
	them from Hardwar. There too a payment has to be made. Recently I
	came across an instance of a respectable family getting a girl from
	Hardwar. She had to be paid for. This is a family with some
	education. We have grown rather intolerant of criticism, i.e.,
	whether of persons or of our community. We should change our
	attitude and be glad if someone were to point out our shortcomings,
	whether in good  faith  or otherwise. Since my return home I have of
	course been in the company of Bhatias, all of whom informed me about
	the sale of brides and other practices. But if you still think that
	I am making some mistake, do write to me again. I do not at all like
	to find fault with an individual or a community, whether native or
	foreign, nor to discuss and much less to dwell upon such faults. I
	am eager to adore virtue. But it is not proper to shut our eyes or
	ears to failings which are manifest and resounding. Therefore, I
	speak about them whenever necessary with all possible restraint.</p>

	A wedding is no doubt an auspicious occasion but music, fun and the

	blissful. An auspicious occasion brings bliss only if we realize its

	weddings with a view to setting models for imitation. His object is
	not to describe marriages but to propound <i>moksha</i>. While doing

and manners. But our worldly experience now is much wider than
Tulsidasji’s. And we can become true devotees of Tulsidas only when
we assimilate his religious approach and with the advantage of our
new experience, we introduce such changes in our social life as our
times demand. Tulsidas, for instance, says that woman only deserves
spanking. Now, do we believe this today? Marriage is intended to help
us cultivate restraint and therefore, we should recall this
implication of marriage from time to time. We omit to do this and so
adultery, indulgence and the like are now on the increase. Marriage
is thus reduced to mere gratification of animal desires. Thinking
deeply over all this, we ought to get out of this state of things.</p>

	have succeeded with your letter as much as Swami did in trying to
	stop you. You have been paid in your own coin. I found  your
	interpretation rather far-fetched. When the seers proclaimed milk to
	be sacred and recommended it in place of meat they had in mind the
	beef-eating Hindus. They did not mean it for vegetarians. All these
	things are pure only in comparison with the other impure food. I
	take goat’s milk not because I regard it as sacred, on the
	contrary I do regard it as impure; and whenever I take it I do so
	with conscious aversion, and yet I am ever afraid if I am not
	yielding somewhat to temptation. I have absolutely no doubt that
	milk cannot be our food whether we look at it from the point of view
	of dharma, or human anatomy or even biochemistry. And if I could
	resist the temptation to utilize some of my faculties, you will
	never see me taking goat’s milk. I have no doubt man’s ideal
	food is the ripe fruit of the forest cooked by Nature. But I have
	neither adequate knowledge of chemistry, or as much self-control as

from non-butchered cattle for their machines, I hope you will not ask

has a one-thing vow begins to feel jealous, that is no new failing in
him; what was dormant, revives by contact. This then is the virtue of
vows. When the mind is cleaned of one thing all the other filth also

who maintain the highest standard but from that of ordinary men and
women. My remarks about “temptation” were intended to suggest
that everyone should feel inspired to join institutions devoted
wholly to public service. The two suggestions made by the <i>Rentia-
</i><i>Premi </i>for making the Spinners’ Association a success are
certainly very good. If all spin with the same diligence as he does
and exert themselves to make it 100 per cent successful, the cause of
khadi will make great strides. Likewise, it is also beyond doubt that
if the Spinners’ Association exercises the same care in rating,
collecting and storing yarn which a jeweller does in rating and
storing a diamond received by him, the khadi movement will make great
progress.</p>

Bengal is demonstrating her superiority over other provinces in the
field of khadi as she has been doing in many other fields. Other
provinces manufacture quite a good quantity of khadi; for the sale of
their products, however, they depend not on themselves but mostly on
demands from outside. Bengal, on the other hand, has from the very
beginning preferred to follow the path of self-reliance. We see this
practice not in one but in all khadi institutions. Bengal has not
sent out a single yard of khadi for sale.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1.22cm; margin-top: 0.08cm">This
example of Bengal deserves to be pondered over by</p>

institutions in other provinces. There is no province as yet which
produces enough khadi for its needs and, after it is sold, has still
some surplus which it sends to other provinces. Before we reach that
stage, we shall have to manufacture khadi worth crores of rupees
annually. Since we wish to make the use of khadi universal, our aim
should be to see that as a rule all the khadi produced is consumed
locally. The efforts we make in this direction will hasten the
universal adoption of khadi. An exception can be made to this rule
only in favour of those provinces in which it is difficult to produce
khadi, but there will be hardly any such province. The chief khadi
producing regions are Tamil Nad, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Bihar.
The bodies [connected with the manufacture of khadi] in these
provinces depend very much on what they are able to send to other
provinces. It is necessary to increase the local demands in all these
regions. Other provinces which may find it necessary to obtain khadi
from these centres will have no difficulty in getting their
requirements, but efforts by  provincial  bodies to increase the
local sale of khadi will result in a great increase in the production
of khadi and in considerable saving in costs.</p>

Bengal is showing us the way. First, the Khadi Pratishthan took a
bold step and had a fairly large quantity of khadi produced. It is
now carrying on propaganda work, with the help of magic lanterns and
other aids, to sell that khadi. It also intends to try to raise the
necessary funds for this purpose from within Bengal. Actually, the
Pratishthan started its work with money obtained from local sources.
If workers keep these three principles in view—local manufacture,
local consumption and local help—in carrying on khadi work, khadi
will spread rapidly and the costs will be kept down. In this, really,
consists the value of khadi, its deeper significance. The basis of
the movement is the belief that khadi meets the needs of the people.
We should prove the truth of this at every step. If, in addition, we
also obtain monetary help locally, the hundreds of thousands of
one-anna coins received as contribution will add up to many lakhs of
rupees. A crore of rupees donated by one person will not probably
benefit the movement as much as contributions received in this
manner.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.05cm; line-height: 102%">
It will take time to reach this ideal and there will also be
difficulties in the way; if we lose sight of the ideal, however, the
khadi movement will fail in its original purpose. In order that it
should become a pure source of help for the poor, it is necessary to
pay increasing attention to the three principles mentioned above.
Till the time that we can follow them, we shall have to adopt other
measures,</p>

accept help from outside sources and the provinces will have to seek
and give mutual co-operation. If, however, the khadi workers forget
to keep their eyes fixed on our light-house, they will meet the fate
of careless sailors. The example of Bengal reminds us of this lesson.</p>

Shri Jamnalalji’s speech as President of the Agrawal Mahasabha
deserves to be read and pondered over. He has displayed the greatest
freedom and courage in it. If the Marwari community can follow Shri
Jamnalalji’s advice, it will lead in effecting essential social
reforms as it leads in acquiring wealth. The reforms advocated by
Shri Jamnalalji are equally necessary for the other castes among
Hindus all over the country. Abuse of the pure weapon of boycott,
dishonest and anti- national commercial practices, love of pleasure
among the rich, adoption of western ways by women, child-marriages,
heavy burden of marriage-expenses, proliferation of sub-castes,
neglect of children’s education, these and other evils prevail in
some measure among Hindus everywhere. They not only sap our vitality,
 but  obstruct our progress towards swaraj. In his speech, Jamnalalji
laid the fullest stress on the eradication of these evils as also on
the removal of untouchability, on khadi and on improving the methods
we adopt for protecting the cow. Let us all hope that the Agrawal
members present at the meeting will act on Jamnalalji’s suggestions
and facilitate the task of other Hindu communities.</p>

	Hanumantharao died yesterday at Vizagapattanam. His was, I think, a
	most noble death; he kept up his honour. But we feel the loss when
	we remember his qualities. Only about ten days back I had a long
	letter from him in which he gently rebuked me for having quinine,

	I have your letter; also the appeal. You say no work is being done
	in your district; the staff think they alone know everything but
	behave in a childish manner. What is the good of putting up a
	building when things stand thus? And how can I agree to it?  A 
	building by itself is no cure for childishness nor can it inspire a
	spirit of service. A building should come up only where the number
	of workers is increasing and they abide by the rules, inspire public
	confidence, enjoy mutual respect, and live in unity. I would
	certainly advise you not even to think of a building, until a good
	number of sincere workers come together.</p>

wholly under your control. Hence it is enough to have made known your

The wedding ceremony performed at the Ashram certainly included other
religious rites conducted by well-known priests from the respective
provinces. But the other fanfare was omitted, and I do believe that
all that is not necessary. The vow contained in the <i>saptapad</i><i>i</i><i>

Your intention is laudable in suggesting that we should have a bigger
size for <i>Navajivan </i>so that it can carry more matter and that
the subscription should be raised if found necessary. But the
suggestion cannot be implemented. I shall see if I can give more
matter in each instalment of the autobiography.</p>

	I have your letter. I understand what you say, but you should note

	progress because they always strive to live up to their elders’

	letter with care. I might have had one or two letters in tolerable
	handwritng. And why can you not think of something to write about?
	Do you have to look aound for a subject when your want to write? So
	many things happen within twenty-four hours, about which you can
	write; also the many thoughts that pass through your mind. One can
	also mention the comings and goings of people. But if it is
	troublesome to write daily, you may write once a week, but on
	condition that  the handwritng is nice and the details are covered.
	I only wanted to say that whatever your vow you should observe it
	with all your mind and heart; only then can it really be kept.</p>

There is a famous classical saying which has now become a proverb
that the man “that hath no music in himself” is either an ascetic
or a beast. We are far from being ascetics, and to the extent that we
are devoid of music we are near allied to beasts. To know music is to
transfer it to life. The prevalent discord of today is an indication
of our sad plight. There can be no swaraj where there is no harmony,
no music.</p>

Where there is discord and everyone striking his own tune, there is
bad government or anarchy. Work for swaraj fails to appeal to us
because we have no music in us. When we have millions of people
singing together in harmony or taking God’s name in unison, making
one music, we shall have taken the first step to swaraj. If we cannot
achieve this simple thing, how can we win swaraj?</p>

We have free music classes in Ahmedabad for the last three years
conducted by one who is an expert. And yet we have to be satisfied
today with a roll-attendance of 10 and regular attendance of four. It
is poor consolation indeed; but we live in hope and Dr. Hariprasad,
who sees a ray of hope when he finds even one <i>pol </i>out of the

Where there is filth and squalour and misery there can be no music.
It implies an atmosphere quite the contrary. If we put a broad

mutual help, it may be said that in no department of life can we
dispense with it.</p>

Music, truly speaking, is an ancient and sacred art. The hymns of
<i>Samaveda </i>are a mine of music, and no <i>ayat </i>of the Koran
can be recited unmusically. David’s Psalms transport you to
raptures and remind you of the hymns from <i>Samaveda</i>. Let us
revive this art and patronize the school of music.</p>

But to go a step further. If we would see music in millions of our
poor homes, we should all wear khadi and spin. The music we have had
today was sweet indeed but it is a privilege of the favoured few. The
music of the spinning-wheel can be a free gift to all and is
therefore sweeter, It is the hope and solace and mainstay of the
millions, and for me therefore the truly good music.</p>

We shall consider music in a narrow sense to mean the ability to sing
and play an instrument well while carrying a tune and marking the
correct beats of time but, in its wider sense, that is to say that
true music is created only when life is attuned to a single tune and
a single time-beat. Music is born only where the strings of the heart
are not out of tune. The experiment with music will be regarded as
successful one when the crores of people in the entire country will
start speaking with the same voice. In my opinion true music is
implict in khadi and the spinning-wheel. So long as that has not been
made explicit, the country is going to welcome anarchy or misrule
and, it will continue to be in a state of bondage.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1</font></sup></p>

that we would not have had to bother about its use if we had not
rented it. Moreover, all arrangments about Mussoorie are finalized,
telegrams have been despatched. It is not right to change that now. I
know quite well that there will be no peace for me there. There may
not be much difference between Panchgani and Mussoorie. Hindi makes a
second difference regarding Panchgani. But you must know that I do
not go there just for a change of climate, but to perform some duty.
I tried hard not to go there. At the moment I have peace here. I have
become intimately mixed up with the activities here, in which I am
interested. <i>Bhaktaraj </i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">1

constitue the twin motive force for me. Moreover, it suits me that
while at the Ashram I can do something without exerting myself. And I
see that Ba too is quite pleased with this. For several such reasons
as also because this place is very agreeable to my health, I am least
anxious to go away; if still I do, it is only to please my guardians.</p>

Now about your problem I would like you to leave your home and become
absolutely free from any attachment. But Kaki<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">2

I think, should sustain the least possible shock. You seem not to
have conceived of Kaki’s return, whereas I have. She may not come
to see you as long as she intends to assert her marital status.
However when she grows totally disinterested, she may herself come to
see you. But in any case, she must have some accommodation here. You
have given up this household; that is right. But the Ashram, i. e.,
you and I, have to arrange her lodging somewhere on the Ashram
premises. If not the same house, some other, maybe the one under
construction. How- ever, that is a different matter. But you should
never lose sight of this duty. I shall call Shankar and explain to
him that he should cheerfully obey your command. For three or four
days past I have been discussing with Ramniklal what Shankar should
do. I for one have come to the conclusion that Shankar must stay with
someone; and Ramniklal agrees with me. I remember your having told me
to put him directly under Thakorebhai’s care. I have therefore
called for Thakorebhai’s report on Shankar. This does not mean that
there is some cause for worry on account of Shankar. But I see from
his irregularity in attendance that Shankar is neither balanced nor
industrious. If these failings are condoned, they may have further</p>

	I had your telegram but no acknowledgement of my letters. You would
	not want me to recommend in the pages of <i>Young India </i>which  I
	may not myself approve of. This proposed collection for South Africa
	is, in my opinion, a mistake. I cannot understand the purpose. The
	fifty thousand rupees granted by the Imperial Citizenship
	Association surely ought to be enough and, necessity being shown, a
	further grant can be had from the Association. And as long as there
	is money in the Association for such purposes as the South African,
	I think it is wrong to ask the public to pay anything. Nor in my
	opinion is the position in any way changed from what it was at

	I have your letter. I have deliberately refrained from writing
	any-thing on Jallianwala Bagh. Soon after coming out of prison I had
	ex-pressed my opinion that for the present we should not set up any
	struc-ture. Such an edifice ought to be a memorial to the unity of
	the followers of different faiths such as Hindu, Muslim and  the 
	like.  Today if we propose something it may become another bone of
	contention. I think the amount is safe. The site is kept clean and
	has grown into something like a park. In the present  unhealthy
	atmosphere around us, I think it best to be satisfied with this
	much. You may please let me know your views. Why do you say this
	responsibility rests solely with Malaviyaji, Motilalji and myself?
	You cannot escape in this way. Your part is no less than that of
	anyone among us three. I hope you are doing well.</p>

	I have your letter. Am I the one to write in English when it is left
	to me? I cannot think of replying in English if you wrote in
	Gujarati. Bhai Chandrashankar will make the corrections and send
	them over to you. This time you have given me Giridhar’s complete
	address. I shall therefore send the letter to that address so as to
	reach there earlier. It seems you wanted it this way. I am inquiring
	why you do not get your <i>Navajivan</i>. Meanwhile it will be

I have your letter. It causes me anxiety. You must definitely prepare
yourself for Mussoorie. It will not be a burden to me in any way. You
will be looked after solely by Devdas. I have told Ghanshyamdas and
Jamnalalji that I shall be having two patients with me. At that time
I did not have you in mind. But that does not matter.  I shall most
probably be going only on the 1st. But even though I am in a great
hurry, I am dictating this much so that you can take an early
decision.</p>

The hospital started under such auspices with fairly ample funds at
its disposal should grow day by day and supply the need of the middle
class women of Bengal. This hospital reminds us of the fact that
social work was as dear to the Deshbandhu as political. When it was
open to him to give away his properties for political work he
deliberately chose to give them for social service in which women’s
service had a prominent part.</p>

that all should wear khaddar clothing. It further believes that
charkhas are the instruments that will drive away famine from the

I congratulate the Conference upon passing the resolution, but will
it be accepted by those who are advised to take up hand-spinning as
part of their caste industry? And will those who voted for khaddar-
wear take to it? I suggest to the members of this Conference that
unless men take to spinning themselves, they will find it difficult
to persuade the women to do so. They will find it still more
difficult to make the necessary improvements in the spinning-wheels
or yarn unless there be sufficient men who will become experts in
spinning and make such improvements as the local wheels are capable
of being adapted to. Hand-spinning for progress depends more upon
solid work than upon resolutions. In all constructive work
resolutions have only limited use in the shape of a slight
propaganda. It is only intelligent and sustained work that counts.</p>

Surely, when Hindus have with a deliberate and conscious effort, not
by way of policy but for self-purification, removed the taint of
untouchability, that act will give the nation a new strength born of
consciousness of having done the right thing and will therefore
contribute to the attainment of swaraj. We are powerless today

The writer seems to admit the necessity of giving these victims of
our ignorance and superstition education both mundane and spiritual.
How is that to be done unless we freely mix with them on terms of

The writer has likened Communists to the untouchables. This is pure
confusion. The Communists are not born. The untouchables are.
Communism is a creed. Untouchability is a disability imposed from
without. As for me, I did not avoid the Communists during  the
Congress week. I saw them freely and had I the time, I  would 
probably have gone to their meeting. They were free to join the
Congress on compliance with its constitution. I support the cause of

Hanumantharao, some time member of the Servants of India Society, is
dead. He has died a martyr to his own ideals. He was a votary of the
nature-cure cult. He did not believe in the use of drugs for curing
the many ills that flesh is heir to. The only aid to nature he
acknowledged was hydropathy according to the system of Louis Kuhne.
His belief in the efficacy of this treatment bordered on religious
faith. He dreamt of popularizing this method among the villagers. He
practised what he preached. He was seriously ill a year ago. He
underwent the water-treatment and was believed to be cured. He was
convalescing at Vizagapatam and died on 20th instant. Up to the last
moment he remained true to his faith. Only a few days before his
death he wrote a long letter avowing his faith and gently rebuking
me, a nature-cure believer like himself, for weakly taking quinine
and submitting to iron and arsenic injections. He had expected more
strength from me. In these days of contradiction between precept and
practice, it is refreshing to find a man like Hanumantharao who would
remain true to his faith even unto death. What if he was mistaken? He
was a searcher after truth. We shall find it only by following what
we hold to be true. Hanumantharao lives though dead, for he had
realized the immortality of the spirit in the perishable body.</p>

Hanumantharao was a patriot. He loved his country with a passion not
to be surpassed. Yet there was no bitterness in him. Non- violence
with him was a creed, not a mere policy. He was therefore on my
unwritten list of civil resisters of the first grade. He had opened a
little institution near Nellore where assisted by a band of
co-workers, he was developing khaddar and serving the so-called
untouchables living in their neighbourhood. The deceased leaves a
widow who believed in her husband and who supported him in his
adoption of a life of poverty and extreme simplicity.</p>

Whilst I appreciate the benevolent motive underlying this advice,   I
cannot help saying that I am unconvinced of the soundness of the
advice. I have never yet copyrighted any of my writings. Tempting
offers have come to me no doubt in connection with the chapters of
the autobiography, if such they may be called, and I am likely to
succumb to the temptation for the sake of the cause I stand for. But
even so, I dare not be exclusive. Writings in the journals which I
have the privilege of editing must be common property. Copyright is
not a natural thing. It is a modren institution, perhaps desirable to
a certain extent. But I have no wish to inflate the circulation of
<i>Young India </i>or <i>Navajivan </i>by forbidding newspapers to
copy the chapters of the autobiography. The message I seek to deliver
through the pages of <i>Young India </i>or <i>Navajivan </i>must
stand on its own bottom and I am satisfied with the number of
subscribers who buy these journals for the message that they stand
for and not for any temporary interest that might be created in
writings such as the autobiography. Nor am I able to subscribe to the
opinion that by not availing myself of the statutory right of
prohibiting the publication of anything I may write in the pages of
these journals, I become a sharer in the sins of those newspaper
proprietors who take in the advertisements referred to by the
correspondent. I do not from the bottom of my heart detest these
advertisements. I do hold that it is wrong to conduct newspapers by
the aid of these immoral advertisements. I do believe that if
advertisements should be taken at all there should be  a  rigid
censorship instituted by newspaper proprietors and editors themselves
and that only healthy advertisements should be taken. But I no more
become a sharer in the crime of taking immoral advertisements by
refraining from making use of the law of copyright, than I do by not
walking to their offices and engaging the proprietors in a duel if
they will not remove the offending advertisements. The evil of
immoral advertisements is overtaking even what are known as the most
respectable newspapers and magazines. That evil has to be combated</p>

I have your letter. How quickly you despair. I am  an incorrigible
optimist and I cannot help it. Where you see no hope at all, I see
some. My faith is never disturbed. People from Bhavnagar may hurl all
sorts of taunts at us, but we must not budge or be bullied.  I am
sure some khadi can always be sold in cities; but our activities
should no doubt cover mostly the villages. I have no objection to
your working on municipalities and similar bodies. But one person
must not take up several jobs. I have found a field for myself. A
political association must have a far-flung activity; khadi work
alone is such an activity, or work among the <i>Antyajas</i>. Quite a
few persons come forward to work in the municipalities. It is a good
thing if they do it and with credit. But not many people are likely

khadi and <i>Antyajas</i>. We alone have to make it respectable. And
if we have the faith, why should we be stopped by public criticism? I
am not convinced by your suggestion that we should stock cotton.
Shambhushankar seems to have done it at Gariyadhar. I do not think
there is anything wrong about it. People may be encouraged to store
cotton, and we may get it carded and spun for them. But all this
should be at their expense. Otherwise we fail to realize the
significance of the khadi movement. The basic motive of the khadi
movement is not boycott of foreign goods but providing work for the
unemployed and freeing them, as far as we can, from hunger. Boycott
may follow as a result of this. If we insist on making it an end in
itself we shall fail. If unemployment and starvation in India were
not linked together as cause and effect I would take my hands off the
wheel.</p>

We must proceed with this in view. Therefore our job is to make the
poor produce khadi and sell it to the masses. Hence I do not feel
concerned about the piling of khadi in Amreli; I should, if it were
to be taken outside Kathiawar. But if it comes to a standstill I may
be prepared even to export it out of the country, not to speak of
Bombay and other places. I can therefore propose only one test.
Whenever we produce khadi we should see whether or not we get it spun
only by those poor people who do not have an alternative occupation,
whether we offer them the approved rates and whether the yarn is spun
diligently or reluctantly. If you are satisfied on these three counts
you may let the work continue there.</p>

	will find at the end of the quotations. If you still have any
	difficulty in getting hold of the books from which the quotations
	have been taken, do please let me know. I would want to add also
	that the statement about poverty of India does not rest merely upon
	the testimony of the late Sir William Wilson Hunter but it has been
	confirmed by subsequent observations made both by Indians and
	Europeans. If you want this information also substantiated by me, I
	shall be pleased to send you proofs. I also suggest to you a method
	that even a man in the street may adopt for verification.</p>

There are many other causes for the growing poverty of the masses but
those that are implied in the questions are, I think, enough for the
ordinary enquirer. I have suggested this line of enquiry to you so as
to enable you to test the tragic truth of India’s growing poverty
in many ways.</p>

I have your letter. I do not claim that the whole truth has been
revealed to me. But in so far as it has been a natural thing for me,
I cannot recall the time in my life when I changed from untruth to
truth. Please tell the lady missionary friend that during my Bengal
tour, I visited several missionary institutions conducted  by
Englishmen. Some of them had nothing to do with hand-weaving or
hand-spinning. She will be interested to know perhaps that I made it
a point to visit the Government weaving Institute at Serampore and
the Girls’ school close by conducted by the Church of England
Mission. If therefore I did not visit her carpet works, it could only
be because of want of time.</p>

	You must pardon me for not writing to you in Urdu. My right hand is

	not worries enough without this additional burden. I have your last
	tele-gram. Let me exaplain my own position. I am in no mood to leave
	the Ashram for a cooler place and therefore I am in no hurry to
	leave it. I am bound by promise to Jamnalalji and other friends that
	I should be ready at their instance to leave Sabarmati any day for a

brief vacation. I would not like to leave a 30 minutes’ class I am
taking and which is not tax on me. Moreover there are small things
which I would like to finish before I go. Thirdly, and from the point
of view of health, what is most important is that the weather here is
delightfully cool. It is unusual for this part of India at this time
of the year but copious rains having fallen in Marwar, they have made
the atmosphere in Gujarat exceptionally cool. One needs to use
blankets in the morning and throughout the day there is no oppressive
heat. This kind of weather is likely to last for some time. It is
therefore really speaking most agreeable for me at the present time.
Even as I am dictaing this, a cold wind is blowing upon me. And I
cannot imagine a better climate anywhere else. I am walking well at
least an hour daily. I am eating well and speaking well. I am putting
on weight at the rate of nearly one pound per week. I would therefore
not like to leave the Ashram whilst these favourable circumstances
last. Moreover, if it is at all possible, why not remove me when
Mussoorie is a little warmer than it is today and then start for
Mussoorie instead of taking an intermediate stage for a few days. All
this might have been necessary if I was very delicate in health and
could not bear the heat here. I am neither delicate nor is there any
heat. Now, I leave the thing in the hands of friends who are for the
moment controlling my movements.</p>

With you, I suppose, you have little right to say what I should do
and should not for for my health. For, you are much more delicate
than I am. From all accounts that I have received, I perceive that
you have lost almost all you have gained in Europe and that you are
paying no attention to your health, will give yourself no rest, and
will see friends and patients at all hours of the day, even night.
Unless therefore you mend your ways, I propose not to listen to you
at all in the matter of precaution about health. I am a follower of
the motto “Physician cure thyself”.</p>

I have your letter. If you wish to serve the poor in the largest
sense of the term, I can only suggest to you the introduction of the
spinning-wheel and khaddar propaganda. It is difficult to work but
you can touch the disease of poverty thereby. I am glad you propose
to begin spinning. You should end with introducing it in every home
as a measure of discipline and sacrifice and [to] the poor for wages.
You can also adopt khaddar yourself and introduce it among your
friends. This continuous identification with the poor will enable you
to find out for yourself many other ways of serving them.</p>

I have your touching letter. I sent you a letter before receiving
yours through Krishna. I sent one also addressed to Hanumantharao’s
wife. I had no doubt in my mind that Hanumantharao had died bravely.
I expect you now so far as it is possible for you to continue
Hanumantharao’s work where he had left it. Let me know about
yourself. What are you doing? I hope that all the members of the
family are taking the event joyfully. It will be wrong to grieve over
a death so brave as Hanumantharao’s. Please send the second letter
that  I wrote to Hanumantharao to the friend at Rajahmundry and let
me have his address also. I would like in so far as it is possible to
put in more work for nature-cure than I have done hitherto. For,
whilst Hanumantharao was alive, I felt that I need not meddle where
he was specializing.</p>

	I am sorry that you felt grieved over my not answering an open

	does not require to be noticed, or acknowledged. Open letters are
	written to public men to draw pointed attention to matters they
	cover.  I sometimes take notice of such letters when I feel that I
	might serve the cause that might have been belittled or
	misrepresented in them. There was no desire to be discourteous. Your

A correspondent writes a bitter letter asking why he does not see
your name figuring in the list weekly published in <i>Young India </i>of
members of the All-India Spinners’ Association. I also ask the same
question. I did not know till the receipt of the letter that you had
not sent a single month’s subscription. If you tell me you are too
worried or too busy, I am not prepared to accept the excuse. Either
hand- spinning is a vital necessity and the Spinners’Association a
proper body for its spread or the spinning-wheel is not a necessity
and, if it is, the Association is not the proper body for its spread.
In the first case, no excuse can be accepted from one in your
position, not to remain in the Association. In the second case no
excuse is necessary for going out of the Association but unequivocal
condemnation is the right course. I know that you swear by the
spinning-wheel. I know that you recognize that the Spinners’
Association is the proper body and therefore it is that I would
refuse to accept any excuse from you.</p>

	You will perhaps recollect that you were good enough to tell me when
	I was at Jamshedpur that you would gladly give me as many spindles
	and <i>taklis </i>as I wanted not exceeding one lac. I think that
	was the number mentioned if my recollection serves me right. I had
	left it to Satish Babu to send the pattern according to which he
	wanted the spindles and <i>taklis </i>to be made. But I do not think
	that the thing materialized much beyond the conversation. At the
	present moment I am overwhelmed with demands for spindles and <i>taklis
	</i>and  I  am unable to cope with them. Could you give me the
	<i>taklis </i>and the spindles? Whilst I have reminded you of the
	conversation, I do not want you to go out of your way to give me
	these articles. I would like you to examine the thing as an
	independent proposition and if you feel that you could without much
	inconvenience or expense help this cottage industry movement to the
	extent I have suggested, I shall be obliged.</p>

	I have sent directly to Mr. Alexander a parcel containing specimens
	of spindles and <i>taklis</i>. There are four varieties and if you
	pro[pose] to supply these you will please fix the number to  be

	I may say that each spindle or <i>takli </i>costs us about two to
	two annas and six pies each. If, therefore, you give me lac for us
	it would amount to a donation of at least Rs. 12,500 and according
	to the advice at my disposal it will cost you nothing less than Rs.
	3,000 in all.</p>

I send you herewith a percel containing four specimens of spindles
and <i>taklis</i>. You will recall the conversation during my visit
to Jamshedpur that I had with Mr. Tata and at which you were present
that your works should give me one lac of spindles and <i>taklis</i>.
I do not see anything was done after the conversation. I have written
to Mr. Tata to ask whether he would like to issue instructions for
the supply of these articles. In order to save time and in
anticipation of Mr. Tata’s answer in the affirmative, I have sent
you the parcel. Will you please then, if you get Mr. Tata’s
sanction, let me have these things as early as possible? I am
overwhelmed with applications for these things and I have found it
difficult to cope with the demand.</p>

If the full one lac is to be given, I would like 25,000 in each of
the four specimens. I need hardly say that they should be absolutely
true. The slightest untrueness about these spindles makes them wobbly
and it becomes difficult to work then with speed. The rims to the
<i>taklis </i>need not be brass or gun-metal. Cast iron will serve
just the same purpose.</p>

than force her to write, because forced writing is likely to produce
a general dislike for letters which will then defeat the very purpose
of letter-writing. I shall of course continue to write letters. Who
told you  I did not approve of Moti’s practice of writing out a
gist of what she read? Well, I think I had praised the practice. I
also faintly remember having written to Moti to prepare her gist
better. Now, I think, Moti’s week too is past. It is my experience
that writing once a week is more difficult to remember than writing
more frequently. But now let us see how Moti keeps up her practice.
Please do not shame her into writing. It does not matter if she
forgets; while yet forgetting, she may overcome her failing.</p>

I saw your letter to Kashi. I can understand your eagerness to have
her back. You had written to her about the cold which made her
hesitate. Now she can leave as soon as you are ready. But no
accommodation has been arranged yet, as I learned on enquiry today.
They have yet to fill in the application form and other things. To
whom is the application to be sent? We shall act promptly if you let
us know the name and address of the person who is authorized to allot
the accommodation. I had an impression that Swami had taken
everything upon himself and all we have to do was to leave this
place. You are not to bother yourself regarding this; I mean not at
the cost of your health. Let us have as much information as you can
send from there and the rest of it we shall manage here. You cannot
at present leave Lonavla; that’s quite right. How you came to have
fever  I shall know only when I get your letter. You should not panic
when you get some temperature; I see signs of it in your letter.</p>

	I have your letter. There can be no impertinence in what you write;
	what then have you to apologize for? I can under- stand your fears.
	I think we can easily make arrangements at Dharampur; but if you go

	it; so you can go there. Or you can go to Simhagad if you want to.
	There too the climate is cool. It was only with me that Jivraj

A friend has asked me questions on some religious issues. I
continually receive such questions, and feel some hesitation in
answering them so often. But it does not seem proper not to answer
them either, since I have thought about these matters and come to
certain conclusions. I therefore answer the following questions to
the best of my ability and understanding.</p>

<i>Yajna </i>is a beautiful and highly suggestive word. Its meaning,
therefore, can change and expand with the growth of our knowledge and
experience or with changing times. The word can be interpreted to
mean worship, sacrifice or service of others. Understood in this
sense, <i>yajna </i>always deserves to be revived. But the <i>yajnas
</i>of various types, that is, rituals of various kinds described as
<i>yajnas </i>in Shastras, do not deserve to be, and in fact cannot
be, revived. Some of these rituals are harmful, and it is also
doubtful whether in Vedic times they were understood inthe sense
which we attach to them now. Whether or not this doubt is justified,
some of these rituals are repugnant to our reason and moral sense.
Anthropologists tell us that there were human sacrifice in old days.
Can we conceive of such a sacrifice being performed now? Anyone who
proposes to perform the horse-sacrifice would make himself an object
of ridicule. We need not go into the question whether <i>yajnas
</i>purify air, for it is irrelevant to ask, in connection with a
religious ritual, whether it results in such a trivial benefit as the
purification of air. Modern physical science can give us better help
in that regard. The essen-tial principles of Shastras are one thing
[and the practice based on them another]. The principles are the same
at all times and in all places. But the practices based on them vary
from age to age and country to country.</p>

I believe this to be quite true. One is born as a human being after
going through the cycle of births in innumerable species, and <i>moksha

attainedonly through life in a human body. If in the ultimate
analysis there is only one <i>atman</i>, its going through the cycle
of countless species in the form of innumerable lives should not seem
impossible or wonderful. Our reason, too, can accept the idea, and
some persons even remember their past lives.</p>

This question presupposes a contradiction between self-control and
yoga. In truth, one of them is the cause of other; or, rather, they
are complements of each other. <i>Samadhi </i>without self-control is
no better than the sleep of Kumbhakarna<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">3
</font></sup>. Without <i>samadhi</i>, again, self- control is
difficult to attain. <i>Samadhi</i>, in this context, should be
understood ina wide sense, not inthe limited sense of the
<i>Hathayogi’s</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 5pt">4
</font></sup><i>samadhi</i>. In truth, this latter is not essential
for attaining control of the senses. It may be a help, but in the
present age ordinary <i>samadhi </i>is the best for us. Ordinary
<i>samadhi </i>means the capacity to be absorbed in the chosen task.
It should not be forgotton that yogic achievements are of no use if
not accompanied by control of the senses.</p>

Self-help means the ability to stand on one’s own feet without help
from others. This does not mean that one should be indifferent to
such help, or decline it when offered or never desire it or ask for
it. But a farmer who, though wanting and seeking others’ help, can
preserve his composure and self-respect when it is refused, is a man
of self-help. A farmer who, though he can get others’ help, himself
attends to all the operations of tilling the land, sowing and
reaping, himself makes the required implements, himself weaves cloth
for his use from yarn spun by himself, stitches his own clothes,
cooks his own food and labours to build a house for himself—such a
farmer is either stupid or self-conceited or is just a savage. 
Self-help  necessarily implies the <i>yajna </i>of bodily labour,
which means that everyone should do such work to earn his livelihood.
Any person, therefore, who works for eight hours in the fields is
entitled to the services of a weaver, a carpenter, a blacksmith and a
mason. It is his duty to seek their services, and he will get them
easily enough. In return, carpenters, blacksmiths and other artisans
get foodgrains produced  by the farmer’s labour. An eye which hopes
to do without help from the hand does not practise self-help, it is
just too proud. As the different limbs of our body practise self-help
in regard to their own functions, and yet are of service to others
because they help one another and dependent on others because they
are helped by one another, so we, the thirty crore limbs of the body
that is India, should follow the duty of self-help in our respective
spheres of work and, to demonstrate that we are limbs of the same
nation, exchange help with one another. Only then shall we have built
up a nation and proved our claim to be patriots.</p>

My view is that Sanskrit should be used in all Hindu religious
ceremonies. However good a translation, it cannot give us the meaning
which lies in the sounds of certain words in the original. Moreover,
by translating into regional languages, and remaining content with
such translations, verses which belong to a language which has
acquired a certain refinement over thousands of years and in which
those verses have always been recited, we diminish the air of
solemnity which attaches to them. But I have no doubt at all in my
mind that the meaning of every verse and every step in the ceremony
should be explained in their own language to the people for whose
benefit they are being recited or performed. It is also my view that
the education of every Hindu is incomplete without an elementary
knowledge of Sanskrit. I simply cannot conceive the continued
existence  of Hinduism without a widespread knowledge of Sanskrit.
The language has been made difficult by the type of curriculum we
follow  in teaching it, in itself it is not difficult at all. Even if
it is, the practice of dharma is still more difficult and, therefore,
to those who wish to follow it in life the means of doing so should
seem easy, however difficult they may actually be.</p>

I had a letter recently from Bhai Kalyanji, telling me of the demise
of Dahyabhai. He also describes Dahyabhai’s condition and adds that
you and your wife took it well. He writes too about the recitation
from the <i>Gita </i>at that time. Since you could maintain a natural
clam, I need not adivse you to have courage. But I must write this,
if only to chasten your faith, that he who really believes in the
reality of the soul will not fear nor be shaken by unexpected death.
Those who pass away in the full bloom of their youth or even at a
tender age also obey Nature’s law. We are frightened because we do
not know all her laws. But why not look at it this way. Dahyabhai’s
soul had no more use for that body and so this fell off. It is only
proper to discard useless matter. This thought should help  us
overcome our grief. Our grief is reasonable only so far as the body
had any use for us. But such grief is selfish. What selfish interest
could a worker have? I want you all to know this truth, shed all your
grief and resume your normal duties. If, even then you cannot
overcome your grief, remember I share it with others. Let everyone
share your grief. <i>Ramanama </i>will give you real peace.</p>

I have your letter. It is certainly advisable as a general rule not
to get a richly variegated cloth from Andhra. But if anyone asks for
some special thing regardless of cost, you should get it at whatever
price it is offered. Ultimately this money too goes into the weavers’
pockets. But in every case we should get things without binding
ourselves in any way. Bhai Karsandas has handed over the yarn you
sent. Are all those women to be registered as members? A member has
to sign the pledge and always use khadi. Please send me Nargisbehn’s
address. As for yourself, you should have patience and depend solely
on nature. If you can cease to be anxious it is certainly well and
good. Of the khadi you asked for we do not have much of the one of
36” width. Khadi of 27” width is available. I am sending it. Can
30”-32” width not serve your purpose? I am sending a sample of
khadi of 36” width. Its price is annas 12 for bleached and annas
11.5 for unbleached. But never mind the price. To you I shall supply
it only at the price you like. I am sending it with Bhai Karsandas
and I have also asked him to get more for you if it is available in
Bombay. I hope in Mahabaleshwar you have improved a lot. Do keep
writing to me.</p>

I have your letter. I see nothing immodest in your letters; so you
may write to me regularly. But I find in them much daydreaming,
disquiet and confusion. It becomes difficult to guess what you wish
to convey. I want you to overcome these shortcomings resolutely. Your
letter seems to suggest that the life of a widow is ever miserable.
But we have experience to the contrary. Child-widows are often
miserable. No doubt about that. But I know many women who were
widowed in childhood but have now grown up bearing their misfortune
with</p>

dignity. This should not be exceptional in Hindu society. A woman may
have only one husband and a man only one wife; but there can be a
number of brothers or sisters. Why do you not look for more brothers?
Will you take no help? Moreover, when your only intention is to serve
what help do you need? Surely you can render no less service by
remaining at your own post. The position of a teacher is not
inconsequential. You can impart as much [education] as you wish to
the girls who come under your guidance. A person who has chosen
service as her mission will surely find opportunities to serve at
every step. I want you to rouse yourself from your slumbers.</p>

	I have your letter. I could deal myself with [the situation]
	regarding the school; you need not come here on that account. But
	you may make the trip if you need a personal assurance. I know
	Jhaveri Deepchand. I stayed at his place in England; I was not
	favourably impressed by him. But I feel that it is more relevant to
	ascertain the character of the young man himself who is being
	considered for betrothal. If he is all right, we can ignore his
	father. If Deepchand Jhaveri’s son is a good lad, I see no serious
	fault in Deepchand Jhaveri as a father-in-law. My advice to
	Liladharbhai will, therefore, be that, rather than think about
	Deepchand Jhaveri, they should make enquiries about his son.</p>

	I have your letter. I had a letter from Chi. Bali too on the same
	subject. It is good you wrote frankly. I shall do whatever I can. I
	suggest that you too start writing to Rami. I have asked her also to
	write to you. And you should write at length about whatever failings
	you notice. I don’t approve of the convention that a married
	couple may not write to each other while their elders are living.
	Indeed, in a HIndu family the training of a girl is completed only
	after her marriage. I could see from my experience that a husband
	who is indifferent to this training or neglects it out of passion,
	fails his own self, his wife and his dharma. Your correspondence can

	I have your letter. Pure love knows no impatience. Pure love has
	nothing to do with the body but belongs to the soul. Love of the
	body in only lust which is of even less importance than the rules of
	caste. There can be no impediment in the path of spiritual love. But
	such love is austere and infinitely patient. What does it care if
	there is no union till death? Your first duty is to place your
	problem before your elders, listen to what they say and think over
	it. Finally, when your heart is cleansed by the observance of the
	prescribed disciplines, it will be your dharma to obey its call.</p>

reply. If going to the Himalayas alone is considered necessary we may
think of moving out. Otherwise I think it is better to to be

I did not know that Taramati was secreting no milk at all. I am sure
if she gets into the habit of working milk will come. Lala
Dhanpatrai, who has many years’ experience, has expressed the view
that cows that have gone dry breed and lactate more abundantly if put
to draught work. Taramati must do as much work as  she  can.
Grinding, I know, is best. Spinning certainly helps. Then there is of
course walking. But that is not sufficient by itself.</p>

I have told them that in accordance with their wishes the amount

the letter I could not help feeling sad that even among extremely
sympathetic and cultured American friends the movement is so little

they can help India, I tell them to study the movement not

My political programme is extremely simple. If the donors had added
the spinning-wheel to untouchability and unity, they would have
practically completed it. My opinion is becoming daily more and more
confirmed that we shall achieve our real freedom only by effort from
within, i.e., by self-purification and self-help,  and therefore by
the strictest adherence to truth and non-violence. Civil disobedience
is no doubt there in the background. But civil disobedience asks for
and needs not a single farthing for its support. It needs and asks
for stout hearts with a faith that will not flinch from any danger
and will shine the brightest in the face of severest trial. Civil
disobedience is a terrifying synonym for suffering. But it is better
often to understand the terrible nature of a thing if people will
truly appreciate its benignant counterpart. Disobedience is a right
that belongs to every human being and it becomes a sacred duty when
it</p>

springs from civility or, which is the same thing, love. The anti-
untouchability reformers are offering civil disobedience against
entrenched orthodoxy.  Protagonists of Hindu-Muslim unity are
resisting with their whole soul those who will divide classes and
sects. Just as there may be this resistance against those who will
hinder the removal of untouchability or promotion of unity, so must
there be resistance against a rule that is stunting India’s
manhood. It is daily grinding down the starving millions of this vast
country. Heedless of future consequences the rulers are pursuing a
course of conduct regarding intoxicating drinks and drugs that must,
if it remains unchecked, corrupt the toilers of the land and make
posterity ashamed of us who are making use of this immoral source of
revenue for educating our children. But the condition of this
terrible resistance against orthodoxy, resistance against enemies of
unity, and resistance against Government—is possible of fulfilment
only by a strong, and if need be a long, course of self-purification
and suffering.</p>

The conductors of the Vidyapith had arranged a khaddar exhibition at
the time of the annual ceremony. I gave last week  extracts from the
speech of Satis Babu who opened the Exhibition. This week I reproduce
extracts from Sjt. Rajagopalachari’s address. There is food enough
in both for young India to ponder over and digest. These national
institutions should exist even though professors and teachers have to
live from hand to mouth and even though the pupils may be counted by
the digits of one hand. Only the teachers and the pupils must be true
to the incredibly simple ideals, viz., truth and non-violence
expressed through the spinning-wheel, purification of Hinduism by
removing the taint of untouchability, and consoli- dation of India by
striving for the heart-unity of different sections professing
different faiths or subfaiths. National education must therefore
respond to these needs and aspirations. A  national University that
would tamper with the ideal for the sake of gaining numbers will have
sold its heritage for a mess of pottage and will deserve to die. The
Bihar Vidyapith has been holding on to the ideal in the face of
tremendous odds. I know its struggles. Bihar is a poor country but
that does not mean that it has not its rich zamindars or its quota of
rich enterprising men from other provinces who are adding to their
riches by their operations in Bihar. Let all these examine the claim
of the Vidyapith as stated in the annual report read before the
Convocation and help if they find the claim to be established and if
they are of opinion that the ideal I have just named is an ideal
worth</p>

I wonder whether khadi lovers have noticed the interesting fact that
out of all the povinces, Bengal alone has steadily refused  to depend
upon customers outside Bengal for the sale of her khadi. Although her
production has been uniformly progressive, she has sold all her khadi
in Bengal. It is the most proper way of handing this great problem.
Deshbandhu whilst he was in Darjeeling used to tell me that the hope
of Bengal leading the way in the matter of khadi as in many other
matters was very great because of the interest the middle class
people took in public matters. He said that he expected to reach the
masses through the middle class who will not only be the first
wearers of khadi but who will also be his first voluntary spinners.
And he expected khadi and the wheel to permeate the masses through
the influence of the middle class. That phenomenon seems to be taking
place in Bengal today on a larger scale than in any other province.</p>

The two large khadi organizers—the Khadi Pratishthan and the Abhoy
Ashram—have somehow or other set their face resolutely against
sending their khadi outside Bengal for sale. The result is that they
weave khadi according to the requirements of the middle class. Hence
they are able to check themselves from time to time and are obliged
to keep up a high level and their sales departments are as well
organized as their production depots. I feel that if the workers all
over India will copy the example of Bengal and organize themselves
for local sales, much time and money will be saved and the progress

I hope the proposed company will be floated. I had complaints of this
nature during the Bihar tour. The reason why the country is not
dotted with khadi stores is that there is as yet not enough demand
for khadi to warrant such stores. Experience shows that when such
stores are opened, and for want of regular propaganda fail to be
self- supporting and are therefore closed after a time, the money
invested is lost and the movement is lost and the movement is
discredited. The better thing therefore is for the All-India
Spinners’ Association agents to keep in touch with khaddar lovers,
advertise specimens and prices and periodically hawk khaddar in the
likeliest place. When they find a place with a regular and large
enough demand, they may advise local moneyed men to open khaddar
store whose business will be to carry on regular propaganda.</p>

Reformers in Travancore have done good  work for the eradication of
untouchability. The more I think about this evil from the point of
view of religion, the more I become convinced that untouchability is
a blot on the fair face of Hinduism. I, therefore, hope that
reformers will not rest in peace till the untouchables are permitted
to enter every temple and join any school in exercise of the rights
they have in common with other Hindus.</p>

	I thank you for your letter. It is perfectly true that very often
	things Indian are misreported and misrepresented. In the instance
	you have quoted, however, the President of the Congress is correctly
	reported. She did advocate a national militia.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.29cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.07cm; line-height: 102%">
	As a reformer wanting the whole world to accept Non-violence as its
	final creed, I do not hesitate to appear on platforms where even
	direct violence may be preached. I no more indentify myself with
	that preaching than I identify myself with all the violence that
	goes on in the world being in it. I hold that it is enough if I
	dissociate myself from every form of violence, mentally and
	physically, and express my disapproval whenever the occasion
	requires it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-right: 0.28cm; text-indent: 0.95cm; margin-top: 0.06cm; line-height: 102%">
	I do not know whether you know that the Congress creed is
	‘attainment of swaraj by peaceful and legitimate means’.
	Violence is therefore eschewed in its entirety in the national
	programme. But I must at the same own that it does not mean that on
	the Congress platform people may not advocate the formation of a
	national militia for purposes of defence. From my own standpoint, a
	national militia is not necessary but people who do not believe in
	Non-violence as their final creed cannot possibly be made
	non-violent. The spread of non- violence depends upon cultivation of
	public opinion. Personally I am satisfied that that spirit is daily
	growing in spite of appearances to the contrary.</p>

	Have your interesting and instructive letter. Whilst I entirely

	he uses should be clear to his readers, I know as a matter of fact

I have your letter and the cutting. In my opinion it would be much
better for you to see Lalaji and Pandit Santanam and make a public
appeal in co-operation with them. I am quite certain that the
institution should live but how to do it depends upon  local
circumstances. People would undoubtedly want to know what Lalaji and
Pandit Santanam have to say.</p>

I have your letter. I do not think that it is necessary to forget
one’s own faith in order to be tolerant towards the rest. In fact,
tolerance loses its value when one’s own faith is forgotten. In my

I have your letter regarding “widow marriage”. Don’t you see
the fallacy underlying your letter? Could you consider that to be
marriage where the girl knows nothing about what a husband can be,
perhaps, she has not even seen the man who is to be her partner in
life and where they have not even lived together for one single
night? I know nothing in Hinduism to warrant such a connection being
accepted as marriage. Then again, what is the use of defending
widowhood of girls of tender age under plea of advocating purity on
the part of men? The latter should certainly be advocated but it
cannot be used in order to cover the wrong heaped upon the fair sex.
The sanctity of widowhood must be felt by the widow, cannot be
imposed upon her. Divorce and other irregularities going on in the
West have surely nothing to do with the very simple question of 
doing elementary justice to the thousands of our own sisters.

I keep getting news about Gomati . Why can you not have a curtain to
ward off mosquitoes? It is surprising that you should lose appetite
there. We do use a number of foreign articles; try lithia-water.
Lithia-water is a mineral product. Borodada used it regularly.
Andrews had strongly recommended it to me, but I did not try it,
because I never felt the need. But it would be good if Gomati tries
it. The loss of appe-tite must be due to the water. I have not
forgotten the Nasik <i>pinjrapole </i>which you have mentioned. Its
manager had seen me. I had no intention of opening a branch of the

Nasik in this connection. If we keep only sick people in the place
